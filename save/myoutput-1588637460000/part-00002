It is black with orange spots. It is present in a variety of habitats and is a [[predator]] species.

The shade of these spots can vary on different beetles (Martin, 2018). It also has a paler blotch above its eyes (Slipinski et al., 2020). The legs and underside are black (Richardson et al., 1844). Its length typically varies between 4.5 to 5.5 mm long (Slipinski et al., 2020; Klimaszewski & Watt, 1997). The elytra is an oval shape that is widest in the middle and the abdomen has slightly different shape between male and female. The abdomen is truncate in males and more rounded in females (Slipinski et al., 2020). The orange spotted ladybird is a medium sized ladybird which has a hemispheric shape (Klimaszewski & Watt, 1997).\n\n== Distribution ==\n\n=== Globally ===\nThe orange spotted ladybird is endemic to New Zealand (Slipinski et al., 2020). This means it is not found anywhere else in the world (Fitter, 2010/2014). It is the only species of the Coccinella genus which is endemic to Australo-Pacific region (Slipinski et al., 2020).\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nOrange spotted ladybirds are recorded over the North and South Islands (Klimaszewski & Watt, 1997). It can be found in the Port Hills in Canterbury (Syrett, 1993). It is also found further down in New Zealand\u2019s South Island in areas including the East Otago Plateau (Barrett, 1987) and in Central Otago (Bremner, 1990). They do not occur on the northern part of the mainland, not on the mainland of Auckland, Coromandel or Northland (Watt, 1982). \u00a0However, they are found on close offshore Islands to the North Island like Poor Knights Island, Hen Island, Chicken Island, Moko Hinau Island, Great Barrier Island, Little Barrier Island, inner Hauraki Gulf islands, Mercury Island, Aldermen Island and Mayor Island (Watt, 1982).\n\n== Habitat preferences ==\nThis species can be from subalpine altitudes to as low as sea level (Crowe, 2002; Klimaszewski & Watt, 1997) and are common in areas where they live (Watt, 1982). They can be found in tussock grasslands (Bremner, 1990) and in vegetation that is low down (Somerfield, 1973). It is also found in native bush areas, pastures and crops (Li, Pang, Slipinski, 2020). They are very common in areas like banks peninsula (Wilson, 2013).\n\n==Native and introduced species==\nAnother species in the same [[genus]] found in New Zealand is the introduced [[eleven-spot ladybird]], ''[[Coccinella undecimpunctata]]'', which looks quite different from this species. Despite this, it has a similar size and [[ecological niche]]. Both species occur in the [[South Island]] and south of the [[North Island]], but in the north of the North Island only the [[introduced species]] is found. However, it is present on islands in areas where it is absent on the mainland, and may be displaced on the mainland as a result of [[interspecific competition]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Insect Predator-Prey Dynamics: Ladybird Beetles and Biological Control  |last=Dixon |first=A.G.F. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-521-62203-4 |pages=194, 196 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXDYowGrv8MC&pg=PA194&lpg=PA194&dq=%22Coccinella+leonina%22+orange+ladybird&source=bl&ots=OE3lNSdqd0&sig=esY4HcVq7INVFV7n1GKov-YcnPQ&hl=en&ei=HuTvScynGIuitgPSqvjmCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#PPA194,M1 |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Hoangus venustus]]'', another native ladybird\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikispecies|Coccinella leonina}}\n{{Commons}}\n* {{aut|Watt, J.C.}} 1986: Beetles (Coleoptera) of the offshore islands of northern New Zealand. pp.&nbsp;221\u2013228 ''in'' {{aut|Wright, A.E.}}; {{aut|Beever, R.E.}} (eds.)
