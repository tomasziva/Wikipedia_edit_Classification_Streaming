In terms of overall tone and style, the series is based principally on the [[Stan Lee]]/[[Steve Ditko]] and Stan Lee/[[John Romita Sr.]] runs on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', with a similar balance of [[action (genre)|action]], [[drama]] and [[comedy]] as well as a high school setting. However, it also tends to blend material from all eras of the comic's run and other sources such as [[Spider-Man in film|Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy]] and the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comics.<ref>[http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2686 Interview with Greg Weisman (Part 1) by Sean Elliott:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622214157/http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2686 |date=June 22, 2008 }} March 7, 2008</ref>\n\n''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' premiered on March 8, 2008, during the [[Kids' WB]] programming block of [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]. The series aired its second season on Marvel's sister network [[Disney XD]] in the United States and ended its run on November 18, 2009. The entire series was broadcast in Canada on [[Teletoon]]. Although a third season was initially planned, the series was cancelled before production could begin due to legal problems between [[Disney]] (who purchased Marvel during the show's run) and [[Sony Pictures Television]] (who created the series).\n\nDespite the legal troubles and cancellation, the series has received widespread universal acclaim from both critics and fans, with much of the praise being aimed at the faithfulness and fidelity to the classic Spider-Man comics, the fresh, unique yet faithful re-imagining of classic Spider-Man concepts and themes, the unique art style, character designs, voice acting, writing, along with Josh Keaton's portrayal of the titular character, and the balance of comedy, drama, action and the exploration of surprisingly mature themes and the realistic insight into the titular character's internal struggles with the burden and problems of being a superhero. Many have praised the series as being, arguably, the best adaptation of Spider-Man to date.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{main|List of The Spectacular Spider-Man episodes}}\nThe two seasons of the series are each set during a semester of Peter's high school years, with season one running from September to November and season two from December to March.<ref name=\"ign_page3\">{{cite web |last1=Goldman |first1=Eric |title=The Spectacular Spider-Man's Past and Future|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/27/the-spectacular-spider-mans-past-and-future |website=IGN |accessdate=February 25, 2020 |language=en |date=June 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nProducer Greg Weisman has stated that the show's theme is \"The Education of Peter Parker.\"<ref>[https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/27/sdcc-07-the-spectacular-spider-man SDCC 07: The Spectacular Spider-Man] July 27, 2007</ref> In keeping with this theme, each of the series arcs is named after courses of study: season one's arcs are Biology 101, Economics 101, Chemistry 101 and Psychology 101, and season two's arcs are Engineering 101, Human Development 101, Criminology 101 and Drama 101.<ref>[http://s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=11222 Ask Greg] June 3, 2009</ref>\n\n===Season 1===\nThe first season features Peter Parker beginning his junior year at Midtown Manhattan Magnet High School, having only been bitten by the genetically-modified spider and acquired his powers and alias as Spider-Man in recent months. While harassed at school, particularly by football star [[Flash Thompson]], he is close friends with classmates [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]]. In order to help support his [[Aunt May]] after the death of his [[Uncle Ben]], Peter gets a job as a freelance photographer at the Daily Bugle, owned by the loudmouth, irascible, egotistical, and gruff publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]], by obtaining pictures of his alter-ego in action so he could carry out a smear campaign against Spider-Man that has, at least temporarily, turned much of the city against the hero. \nPeter and Gwen are also given junior lab assistant positions under [[Dr. Curt Connors]] at Empire State University, where they join their friend and mentor [[Eddie Brock]]. As Spider-Man uses his powers to fight against petty crime, he gains the attention of the [[Big Man (Marvel Comics characters)|Big Man]] who orchestrates crime in New York City, with attention initially drawn to his fights with [[Enforcers (comics)|the Enforcers]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and [[Lizard (comics)|the Lizard]]. \nWith the help of [[Norman Osborn]], his chief scientist [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] and criminal [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], the Big Man (alias of crime lord [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]) oversees the development of a project to create \"supervillains\" designed to distract Spider-Man from other crimes and stop damaging his profits. These new enemies include [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], both petty criminals who regularly fell victim to Spider-Man. However, the Big Man's plans become greatly complicated when the mysterious [[Green Goblin]] enters the picture. Throughout the first season, the other opponents are introduced are [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] who has a crush on him, [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]] and [[Tinkerer|Phineas Mason]] appear as Chameleon's associates. After the Green Goblin is vanquished, Spider-Man's [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] black suit makes an appearance, eventually leading to Eddie Brock's transformation into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].\n\n===Season 2===\nPeter Parker's life becomes significantly more complicated as he finds himself torn between both Gwen Stacy and [[Liz Allan]], both of whom have confessed their feelings for him; he eventually chooses Liz. Norman Osborn takes on the role of Peter's mentor, pulling strings to re-establish his job as Dr. Connors' lab assistant, as well as overseeing the installment of the conniving [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Miles Warren]] into the ESU Labs. \nMeanwhile, as Spider-Man, Peter encounters new villains [[Mysterio]] and [[Kraven the Hunter]], leading him to investigate the activities of a mysterious new crime lord known as the \"[[Doctor Octopus|Master Planner]]\". When the Master Planner's first scheme fails, Spider-Man is faced with a three-way gang war between the Planner's super-villain forces, the Big Man's established order, and the old guard of [[Silvermane|Silvio \"Silvermane\" Manfredi]]'s family. Peter's search for Eddie Brock also leads to the return of Venom, who attempted to expose Spider-Man's secret identity and remove his powers. Finally, when the three major crime lords are arrested, Spider-Man once again goes up against the Green Goblin, who is once again bent on eliminating the wall-crawler once and for all. The series ends with a cliffhanger due the show being cancelled before a third season could be produced.\n\nOther new characters introduced in the second season include [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Sha Shan|Sha Shan Nguyen]], [[Silver Sable]], [[Roderick Kingsley]] and [[Molten Man]]. Quentin Beck and Phineas Mason return as [[Mysterio]] and the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] respectively.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Spectacular Spider-Man characters}}\n\nThe timeline of the original Spider-Man story-arcs has been condensed and reconfigured in order to include classic and important characters who originally appeared much later. Characters such as [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]] are depicted not completely as direct equivalents to their older counterparts from the comics, but rather as characters who evolve into their established roles from the comics. The series also sports a very wide supporting cast. Every named character who appears in the series, even very minor characters, is based on a character who appeared in the original comics, ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' series (such as Kenny Kong), or film series (such as Bernard Houseman). The series also incorporates a number of villains from different eras of the Spider-Man universe, almost all of whom are introduced as regular characters in first episodes before they transform into established villain identities (an example is [[Eddie Brock]], who was introduced at the very beginning of the series, but only became Venom in the season 1 finale).\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Josh Keaton]] - [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]\n*[[Benjamin Diskin]] - [[Eddie Brock]] / [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]\n*[[James Arnold Taylor]] - [[Harry Osborn]], [[Frederick Foswell|Fredrick Foswell / Patch]]\n*[[Lacey Chabert]] - [[Gwen Stacy]]\n*[[Alanna Ubach]] - [[Liz Allan]]\n*[[Keith David]] - [[Tombstone (comics)|L.

Weisman and Cook were assigned to the series at the time as supervising producer and producer/supervising director, respectively. The art style of the series is more simplified than in previous incarnations but retain their iconic elements.

Therefore, neither Sony nor Marvel could continue production of the series, as each lacked some of the essential rights to do so.

In terms of overall tone and style, the series is based principally on the [[Stan Lee]]/[[Steve Ditko]] and Stan Lee/[[John Romita Sr.]] runs on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', with a similar balance of [[action (genre)|action]], [[drama]] and [[comedy]] as well as a high school setting. However, it also tends to blend material from all eras of the comic's run and other sources such as [[Spider-Man in film|Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy]] and the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comics.<ref>[http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2686 Interview with Greg Weisman (Part 1) by Sean Elliott:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622214157/http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2686 |date=June 22, 2008 }} March 7, 2008</ref>\n\n''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' premiered on March 8, 2008, during the [[Kids' WB]] programming block of [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]. The series aired its second season on Marvel's sister network [[Disney XD]] in the United States and ended its run on November 18, 2009. The entire series was broadcast in Canada on [[Teletoon]]. Although a third season was initially planned, the series was cancelled before production could begin due to legal problems between [[Disney]] (who purchased Marvel during the show's run) and [[Sony Pictures Television]] (who created the series).\n\nDespite the legal troubles and cancellation, the series received widespread universal acclaim from both critics and fans, with much of the praise being aimed at the faithfulness and fidelity to the classic Spider-Man comics, the fresh, unique yet faithful re-imagining of classic Spider-Man concepts and themes, the unique art style, character designs, voice acting, writing, along with Josh Keaton's portrayal of the titular character, and the balance of comedy, drama, action and the exploration of surprisingly mature themes and the realistic insight into the titular character's internal struggles with the burden and the problems of being a superhero. Many have praised the series as being, arguably, the best adaptation of Spider-Man to date.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{main|List of The Spectacular Spider-Man episodes}}\nThe two seasons of the series are each set during a semester of Peter's high school years, with season one running from September to November and season two from December to March.<ref name=\"ign_page3\">{{cite web |last1=Goldman |first1=Eric |title=The Spectacular Spider-Man's Past and Future|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/27/the-spectacular-spider-mans-past-and-future |website=IGN |accessdate=February 25, 2020 |language=en |date=June 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nProducer Greg Weisman has stated that the show's theme is \"The Education of Peter Parker.\"<ref>[https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/27/sdcc-07-the-spectacular-spider-man SDCC 07: The Spectacular Spider-Man] July 27, 2007</ref> In keeping with this theme, each of the series arcs is named after courses of study: season one's arcs are Biology 101, Economics 101, Chemistry 101 and Psychology 101, and season two's arcs are Engineering 101, Human Development 101, Criminology 101 and Drama 101.<ref>[http://s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=11222 Ask Greg] June 3, 2009</ref>\n\n===Season 1===\nThe first season features Peter Parker beginning his junior year at Midtown Manhattan Magnet High School, having only been bitten by the genetically-modified spider and acquired his powers and alias as Spider-Man in recent months. While harassed at school, particularly by football star [[Flash Thompson]], he is close friends with classmates [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]]. In order to help support his [[Aunt May]] after the death of his [[Uncle Ben]], Peter gets a job as a freelance photographer at the Daily Bugle, owned by the loudmouth, irascible, egotistical, and gruff publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]], by obtaining pictures of his alter-ego in action so he could carry out a smear campaign against Spider-Man that has, at least temporarily, turned much of the city against the hero. \nPeter and Gwen are also given junior lab assistant positions under [[Dr. Curt Connors]] at Empire State University, where they join their friend and mentor [[Eddie Brock]]. As Spider-Man uses his powers to fight against petty crime, he gains the attention of the [[Big Man (Marvel Comics characters)|Big Man]] who orchestrates crime in New York City, with attention initially drawn to his fights with [[Enforcers (comics)|the Enforcers]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and [[Lizard (comics)|the Lizard]]. \nWith the help of [[Norman Osborn]], his chief scientist [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] and criminal [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], the Big Man (alias of crime lord [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]) oversees the development of a project to create \"supervillains\" designed to distract Spider-Man from other crimes and stop damaging his profits. These new enemies include [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], both petty criminals who regularly fell victim to Spider-Man. However, the Big Man's plans become greatly complicated when the mysterious [[Green Goblin]] enters the picture. Throughout the first season, the other opponents are introduced are [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] who has a crush on him, [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]] and [[Tinkerer|Phineas Mason]] appear as Chameleon's associates. After the Green Goblin is vanquished, Spider-Man's [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] black suit makes an appearance, eventually leading to Eddie Brock's transformation into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].\n\n===Season 2===\nPeter Parker's life becomes significantly more complicated as he finds himself torn between both Gwen Stacy and [[Liz Allan]], both of whom have confessed their feelings for him; he eventually chooses Liz. Norman Osborn takes on the role of Peter's mentor, pulling strings to re-establish his job as Dr. Connors' lab assistant, as well as overseeing the installment of the conniving [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Miles Warren]] into the ESU Labs. \nMeanwhile, as Spider-Man, Peter encounters new villains [[Mysterio]] and [[Kraven the Hunter]], leading him to investigate the activities of a mysterious new crime lord known as the \"[[Doctor Octopus|Master Planner]]\". When the Master Planner's first scheme fails, Spider-Man is faced with a three-way gang war between the Planner's super-villain forces, the Big Man's established order, and the old guard of [[Silvermane|Silvio \"Silvermane\" Manfredi]]'s family. Peter's search for Eddie Brock also leads to the return of Venom, who attempted to expose Spider-Man's secret identity and remove his powers. Finally, when the three major crime lords are arrested, Spider-Man once again goes up against the Green Goblin, who is once again bent on eliminating the wall-crawler once and for all. The series ends with a cliffhanger due the show being cancelled before a third season could be produced.\n\nOther new characters introduced in the second season include [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Sha Shan|Sha Shan Nguyen]], [[Silver Sable]], [[Roderick Kingsley]] and [[Molten Man]]. Quentin Beck and Phineas Mason return as [[Mysterio]] and the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] respectively.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Spectacular Spider-Man characters}}\n\nThe timeline of the original Spider-Man story-arcs has been condensed and reconfigured in order to include classic and important characters who originally appeared much later. Characters such as [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]] are depicted not completely as direct equivalents to their older counterparts from the comics, but rather as characters who evolve into their established roles from the comics. The series also sports a very wide supporting cast. Every named character who appears in the series, even very minor characters, is based on a character who appeared in the original comics, ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' series (such as Kenny Kong), or film series (such as Bernard Houseman). The series also incorporates a number of villains from different eras of the Spider-Man universe, almost all of whom are introduced as regular characters in first episodes before they transform into established villain identities (an example is [[Eddie Brock]], who was introduced at the very beginning of the series, but only became Venom in the season 1 finale).\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Josh Keaton]] - [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]\n*[[Benjamin Diskin]] - [[Eddie Brock]] / [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]\n*[[James Arnold Taylor]] - [[Harry Osborn]], [[Frederick Foswell|Fredrick Foswell / Patch]]\n*[[Lacey Chabert]] - [[Gwen Stacy]]\n*[[Alanna Ubach]] - [[Liz Allan]]\n*[[Keith David]] - [[Tombstone (comics)|L.

Therefore, neither Sony nor Marvel could continue production of the series, as each lacked some of the essential rights to do so.
