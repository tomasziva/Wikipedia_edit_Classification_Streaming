It is based on four regions: Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania, and currently comprises up to 24 teams. The ESL Pro League is considered to be the premier professional CS:GO league in the world and is one of the major professional leagues in esports. The ESL Pro League began as a venture between the [[ESL (eSports)|Electronic Sports League]] (ESL) and [[ESEA League|E-Sports Entertainment Association League]] (ESEA). Its inaugural season started on May 4, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hltv.org/stats?event=1742|title=ESL ESEA Pro League Season 1|website=HLTV.org|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn early November 2014, the German-based Electronic Sports League announced the creation of the ESL Pro League as the European ESL league.

Starting with [[ESL Pro League Season 4|Season 4]], ESL decided to expand the Pro League to 28 teams, so that there would be fourteen teams per league. This also meant that six teams from each region would qualify for the offline finals. For each regular season, teams would play every team twice in its respective league, so that each team played twenty-two games for the first three seasons and twenty-four games from season four to [[ESL Pro League Season 7|season seven]]. However, in Season 7, two teams \u2013 [[Counter Logic Gaming]] and [[Misfits Gaming|Misfits]] \u2013 dropped their rosters and forfeited their Pro League licenses, reducing the number of North American teams to twelve. Also in season 7, ESL decided to expand geographically by creating the Asia-Pacific and LA LEAGUE (South America) divisions, bumping the number of teams up from 24 to 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/misfits-clg-not-in-epl-s7-21005|title=Misfits and CLG back out of the ESL Pro League|first=Jamie|last=Villanueva|website=Dot eSports|date=February 11, 2018|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref> This was later for season 9 changed to four regions as North America and South America were integrated into one region. In addition, the Europe and Americas region features offline group play. Season 9 featured eight teams from Europe, six teams from the Americas, one team from Asia, and one team from the Oceania region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hltv.org/news/25678/esl-introduces-offline-pro-league-group-matches-in-eu-na|title=ESL INTRODUCES OFFLINE PRO LEAGUE GROUP MATCHES IN EU, NA|first=Zvonimir|last=Burazin|website=HLTV.org|date=December 18, 2018|accessdate=December 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first three offline finals had eight teams, in which teams were split up into two groups of four in a double-elimination, GSL group format and two teams from each group qualified for the playoffs. The playoffs featured four teams, with the semifinals being a best of three and the finals being a best of five. Starting from season four to season six, teams were split up into two groups of six and each team would play every team in its group once for the group stage. Three teams from each group qualified for the playoffs. The round of 6 and the semifinals are best of three series and the finals area best of five, with the exception of season four, in which the finals were a best of three. In season seven, with the EPL expansion, the number of teams went up to sixteen.\n\nESL Pro League also features a promotion and relegation stage, in which the worst performing team in each league after each season is relegated to ESEA's Premier Division ([[Mountain Dew]] League) while the best team from the Premier Division is promoted to the Pro League. In addition, the next two worst performing teams by the end of the Pro League Season and the next two best teams in the Premier Division play out a double elimination bracket to fight for two spots in the following season's Pro League while the other two would play in the Premier Division.\n\nUnlike the [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]-sponsored [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championships|CS:GO Major Championships]], in which team slots are given based on the player rosters, ESL awards spots to the organization. For instance, Valve would consider SK Gaming to have won two Major Championships, as the players ([[FalleN]], fer, coldzera, fnx, TACO) won one at MLG Columbus 2016 while under contract with [[Luminosity Gaming]] and won another at [[ESL One Cologne 2016]] while under contract with SK Gaming. In addition, if the majority of the roster transfers to another team, Valve would give take away the spot from the old team and give it to the team that the core of the roster headed to. At [[ESL One Katowice 2015]], PENTA Sports made it to the top eight at the tournament, giving the players a guaranteed spot at the next major, [[ESL One Cologne 2015]]; however, players denis, Spiidi, and nex were bought out by [[mousesports]], thus giving mousesports PENTA Sports's spot at Cologne 2015 as the majority of PENTA moved to the mousesports team. EPL would consider Luminosity Gaming, which won Season 3, to have one title and SK Gaming, which won Season 6, to also have just one title. However, a team is allowed to sell or simply give its Pro League license to another organization, as in the case of [[Tempo Storm]] transferring its roster to the [[Immortals (eSports)|Immortals]] organization for Season 4.\n\n==Season 11 teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"200px\"|Europe\n! width=\"200px\"|Americas\n! width=\"200px\"|CIS\n! width=\"200px\"|Oceania\n! width=\"200px\"|Asia\n|-\n| {{flagicon|EU}} [[mousesports]]\n|\n| \n|\n| \n|-\n| {{flagicon|SWE}} [[Fnatic]]\n|\n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|DEN}} [[Astralis]]\n|\n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|EU}} [[FaZe Clan]]\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Team Liquid]]\n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|ESP}} [[G2 Esports]]\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Evil Geniuses]]\n| {{flagicon|UKR}} [[Natus Vincere]]\n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|DEN}} [[F.C.

[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]] is currently in its eleventh season.

In addition to the Rainbow Six Siege league, ESL also has a [[Halo (series)|Halo]] league. However, the two leagues are much less prominent than the Counter-Strike league as Rainbow Six only has a $248,000 prize pool compared to CS:GO's $1,000,000 prize pool.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{ESLevents}}\n{{Professional Counter-Strike competition}}\n{{Esports}}\n\n[[Category:ESL Pro League| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox sports league\n| current_season = ESL Pro League Season 11\n| logo =ESL Pro League 2019_v2.png\n| sport = esports\n| game = ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]''\n| founded = {{Start date and age|mf=yes|2015|5|4}}\n| owner = [[Electronic Sports League]] <br /> (ESL)\n| teams = 24\n| champion = {{flagicon|SWE}} [[Fnatic]] (3rd title) (Season 11, EU region)<br/>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Team Liquid]] (2nd title) (Season 11, NA region)\n| most_champs = {{flagicon|SWE}} Fnatic (3 titles)\n| countries = International\n| headquarters = [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]\n| TV = {{unbulleted list\n| [[Facebook]]\n| [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]\n| [[YouTube]]\n}}\n| website = [https://pro.eslgaming.com/csgo/proleague/ EPL English website]\n}}\n\nThe '''ESL Pro League''' (formerly '''ESL ESEA Pro League'''; shortened as '''EPL''') is a ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' (CS:GO) professional [[esports]] league.

In season seven, with the EPL expansion, the number of teams went up to sixteen.\n\nESL Pro League also features a promotion and relegation stage, in which the worst performing team in each league after each season is relegated to ESEA's Premier Division ([[Mountain Dew]] League) while the best team from the Premier Division is promoted to the Pro League. In addition, the next two worst performing teams by the end of the Pro League Season and the next two best teams in the Premier Division play out a double elimination bracket to fight for two spots in the following season's Pro League while the other two would play in the Premier Division.\n\nUnlike the [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]-sponsored [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championships|CS:GO Major Championships]], in which team slots are given based on the player rosters, ESL awards spots to the organization. For instance, Valve would consider SK Gaming to have won two Major Championships, as the players ([[FalleN]], fer, coldzera, fnx, TACO) won one at MLG Columbus 2016 while under contract with [[Luminosity Gaming]] and won another at [[ESL One Cologne 2016]] while under contract with SK Gaming. In addition, if the majority of the roster transfers to another team, Valve would give take away the spot from the old team and give it to the team that the core of the roster headed to. At [[ESL One Katowice 2015]], PENTA Sports made it to the top eight at the tournament, giving the players a guaranteed spot at the next major, [[ESL One Cologne 2015]]; however, players denis, Spiidi, and nex were bought out by [[mousesports]], thus giving mousesports PENTA Sports's spot at Cologne 2015 as the majority of PENTA moved to the mousesports team. EPL would consider Luminosity Gaming, which won Season 3, to have one title and SK Gaming, which won Season 6, to also have just one title. However, a team is allowed to sell or simply give its Pro League license to another organization, as in the case of [[Tempo Storm]] transferring its roster to the [[Immortals (eSports)|Immortals]] organization for Season 4.\n\n==Season 11 teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"200px\"|Europe\n! width=\"200px\"|Americas\n! width=\"200px\"|CIS\n! width=\"200px\"|Oceania\n! width=\"200px\"|Asia\n|-\n| {{flagicon|EU}} [[mousesports]]\n|\n| \n|\n| \n|-\n| {{flagicon|SWE}} [[Fnatic]]\n|\n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|DEN}} [[Astralis]]\n|\n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|EU}} [[FaZe Clan]]\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Team Liquid]]\n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|ESP}} [[G2 Esports]]\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Evil Geniuses]]\n| {{flagicon|UKR}} [[Natus Vincere]]\n| \n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon|DEN}} [[F.C.

The country beside the team name was the nationality of the last players fielded by the team before being out of Pro League. \"Inactive\" indicates the team is not active in the Counter-Strike scene, but the team is active in other eSports. \"Defunct\" indicates the team shut down operations due to any reason, such as financial issues. \"Premier Division,\" also known as the Mountain Dew League, means that the team is in the division under the Pro League. FlipSid3 Tactics became the first team that took part in an EPL season to be demoted to the Main Division, which is the division under the Premier Division.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"200px\"|Team\n! width=\"120px\"|Last appearance\n! width=\"200px\"|Status\n|-\n| {{flagicon|DEN}} [[Team SoloMid]]\n| Season 2\n| Inactive\n|-\n| {{flagicon|FRA}} [[Titan (eSports)|Titan]]\n| Season 2\n| Defunct\n|-\n| {{flagicon|CIS}} [[FlipSid3 Tactics]]\n| Season 3\n| Main Division\n|-\n| {{flagicon|GER}} PENTA Sports\n| Season 4\n| Inactive\n|-\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Echo Fox]]\n| Season 5\n| Inactive\n|-\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Selfless Gaming]]\n| Season 5\n| Defunct\n|-\n| {{flagicon|NZL}} [[Winterfox]]\n| Season 5\n| Inactive\n|-\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Counter Logic Gaming]]\n| Season 6\n| Inactive\n|-\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Misfits Gaming|Misfits]]\n| Season 6\n| Inactive\n|-\n| {{flagicon|BRA}} [[SK Gaming]]\n| Season 7\n| Inactive\n|}\n\n==Seasons==\nThe list of seasons and the top two teams in each season are in shown below.

However, due to the global [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], ESL announced that both the regular season and the finals will be split into two regions: Europe and North America, and that the regular season and the finals will be played entirely online. This was decided based on health and safety reasons and to minimize movement across regions.</ref>\n}}\n\n==Other Leagues==\nESL also has two other leagues outside of Counter-Strike. [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]] is currently in its eleventh season. The PENTA Sports/[[G2 Esports]] core has the most titles with four, as the team won the Year 1 Season 1, Year 2 Season 1, Year 2 Season 2, and Season 8 titles. In addition to the Rainbow Six Siege league, ESL also has a [[Halo (series)|Halo]] league. However, the two leagues are much less prominent than the Counter-Strike league as Rainbow Six only has a $248,000 prize pool compared to CS:GO's $1,000,000 prize pool.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{ESLevents}}\n{{Professional Counter-Strike competition}}\n{{Esports}}\n\n[[Category:ESL Pro League| ]]\n", "name_user": "Prosnipzzz", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESL_Pro_League"}
