Customers and performers are able to communicate with each other by using keyboard, speech, and two-way cameras.<ref name=Rachel/> Within public chat rooms the audience can see tips and viewer comments as scrolling text which appears next to the real-time video stream. Camgirls will frequently read and respond to the scrolling viewer comments.<ref name=Richtel/> The chatter is constant, and is often led by a small band of regular fans.<ref name=Bartlett/> \n\nThis is not the first time that conversational interaction had become a boon for the erotic entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, sociologist Paul Cressey noted that within the hundreds of [[taxi dance hall|taxi-dance halls]] of America, \"the traffic in romance and in feminine society\" would become available when [[taxi dancer]]s would offer their companionship and \"the illusion of romance\" for ten cents a dance.<ref name=\"Cressey1\">{{cite book| last=Cressey| first=Paul| title=The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life| date=1932| publisher=University of Chicago Press| location=Chicago, IL| isbn=9780226120515| pages=[https://archive.org/details/taxidancehall00paul/page/10 10\u201311, 129]| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/taxidancehall00paul/page/10}}</ref><ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite news| last1=Wright |first1=Evan | title=Dance With A Stranger |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/dance-with-a-stranger-2130263 | accessdate=6 February 2018| work=LA Weekly | date=20 January 1999}}</ref> The [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]] strip club is credited with the invention of the [[lap dance]] in 1977 when their new stage, New York Live, pioneered customer-contact shows with [[stripper]]s that came off the stage and sat in the laps of customers for tips.<ref name=McCumber1>{{cite book | first=David | last=McCumber | pages=78\u201380, 155 | title=X-Rated | location= New York | publisher=  Pinnacle Books | year=1992 | isbn=978-0786011131}}</ref> Enabled with this new revenue stream for strippers, the [[strip club]] industry went through a period of extreme growth during the 1980s. \n\nMuch of the success of camming owes to its ability to move beyond the borders of erotic video performance, and into the everyday social lives of camming customers. Webcam performers are often highly entrepreneurial, and use mainstream social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, and Tumblr to build and maintain relationships with their customers.<ref name=Rabouin/> Some fans communicate multiple times a day with models through social media. \n\nUnlike traditional pornography, the interactive nature of the camming medium titillates with the promise of ''virtual friendship''. [[Princeton University]] sociologist and author of ''The Purchase of Intimacy'', [[Viviana Zelizer]], states of camming: \"they're defining a new kind of intimacy. It's not traditional sex work, not a relationship, but something in between.\"<ref name=Richtel/>  Cam models perform not just sex work, but also perform through their hosting duties, conveying authenticity, creating and animating fantasies, and managing relationships over time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nayar|first=Kavita|title=Working it: the professionalization of amateurism in digital adult entertainment|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=17|year=2017|issue=3|pages=473\u2013488|doi=10.1080/14680777.2017.1303622}}</ref>\n\nWithin ''Cam Girlz'', a documentary film about the industry, male fans often say that they come to camming sites as a way to fulfill emotional needs. The film's director, Sean Dunne, states of the fans, \"they said it's not like a strip club \u2013 it's like a community, and you feel it when you\u2019re in these chat rooms. It's a community and entertainment that goes very far beyond sexuality.\"<ref name=Rabouin/>\n\nHowever Dr. Kari Lerum of the [[University of Washington]] suggests that men are more open and vulnerable in cam rooms than in strip clubs, and can become very invested in relationships which only exist on the screen.<ref name=Richtel/>. This proposition was supported by a 2019 study of over 6,000 webcam users by the webcam platform [[Stripchat]]. The study found that over 40% of its users had developed significant relationships with their cam models, ranging from friendship to deep emotional connections. <ref name=\"Ley\">{{cite news| last1=Ley |first1=David | title=Am iCheating? |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-who-stray/201907/am-icheating  | accessdate=20 August 2019| work=Psychology Today | date=23 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nThe term [[webcam]] is a [[clipped compound]] used to combine the terms [[World Wide Web]] and [[video camera]].\n\nWhen webcam models create their live [[webcast]]s, they perform the activity known as ''camming''.\n\nA third-party hosting website which transmits multiple webcam models' video-streams is known as a ''camming site''.\n\nWebcam models mostly perform individually in separate video [[chat rooms]], which are frequently referred to as ''rooms''.\n\nThe term \"camwhore\" was first used in print in November 2001;<ref>Torpy, Kathryn. (November 10, 2001) [[The Courier-Mail]] ''Virtual lolitas.'' Page 4.</ref> however, the label is considered derogatory and pejorative.<ref>Chua, Grace.

The pornography business as a whole is estimated to be about $5 billion.<ref name=Rabouin/> According to the [[web traffic]] analysis service [[Compete.com]], [[LiveJasmin]] generates more than 9 million unique viewers a month. Similar webcam model hosting sites such as [[Chaturbate]], [[CAM4]] and [[MyFreeCams.com]] boast 4.1 million, 3.7 million and 2 million unique monthly visitors, respectively.<ref name=Rabouin/> \n\nThe decentralized business model of camming has upended the pornography industry in multiple ways. Camming revenue has been severely cutting into the profits of the pornographic movie business, which has also been eroded for a number of years by piracy and the distribution of free sexual content upon the Internet.<ref name=Richtel/> Additionally, the pornographic film industry used to be male-dominated except for the performers. But since camming requires only a video camera, broadband service, and computer, there has now been a power reversal and female webcam performers are driving the industry.<ref name=Rachel/><ref name=Hess>{{cite news|last1=Hess |first1=Amanda | title=Who Gets to Be Sexy? | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/style/porn-women-nonbinary-queer.html |accessdate=7 May 2018|work=New York Times|date=5 May 2018}}</ref> Todd Blatt, a former pornographic movie producer, has said, \"If you're the middle guy who has been eating off this industry for 20 years, it's a big change.

Some sites charge viewers a fixed fee per minute, although many allow free access for unregistered visitors.<ref>Prager, Michael. (May 29, 2002) [[Boston Globe]] ''Wired now looks as good as it is.'' Section: Li';l'kving; Pge D4.</ref> These Internet hosting websites, known as ''camming sites'', take care of the technical work{{ndash}}hosting the video feed broadcast, processing payments, providing an intuitive interface, advertising{{ndash}}so that the cam model only has to focus on the actual shows for their video chat room. Most cam models are [[independent contractor]]s for camming sites, and are not employees.<ref name=McGehee/>\n\nBy presenting hundreds of different models via individual chat rooms, a camming site becomes a talent aggregator and middleman \u2013 but only in the sense that Apple is the middleman for bands selling music on iTunes.<ref name=Richtel/> Though a camming website may carry many hundreds of models, they frequently provide an interface for the viewer to easily switch between the most-visited models' rooms, and that interface occasionally resembles the multiple channel selection of [[cable television]].<ref name=McGehee/>\n\nCamming sites typically supply each webcam model with an individual profile webpage where the performer can describe themselves, and more importantly create a virtual store where they can sell items like videos, photos, personal clothing, and memberships to their fan club. The profile page's virtual store creates a stream of passive income, meaning that even if a camgirl is not online and performing, she can still generate money while fans come to the ever-present profile page to purchase its wares. Some of the most popular items are homemade videos that cam models make of themselves.<ref name=Hess/> While most these videos are sexual in nature, they often include elements of comedy, fashion, and a narration of their lifestyles. The affordability of and access to new video recording technology has spawned new variations and genres of pornography since individual women, as well as industry players, can now create content.<ref name=Hess/> A profile page might also sell contact information like a personal phone number, a spot on a model's Snapchat contact list, or the ability to send her private messages through a camming site's friends list.<ref name=McGehee/> The profile page may also suggest tip amounts for real-time performance requests, like a sexy dance, a song request, removal of clothing, or a particular sex act.<ref name=McGehee/> All prices on a profile page are listed in quantities of tips, which are electronic tokens that the viewer can buy in bunches from the cam site to be given to various models during performance, or in later purchases upon the profile page.<ref name=Richtel/><ref name=Bertrand>{{cite news|last1=Bertrand|first1=Natasha|title=How Webcam Models Make Money|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-webcam-models-make-money-2014-11|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=New York Times|date=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe camming site keeps a percentage of the tips, but the amount varies. Big earners can get a bigger chunk of their tips.<ref name=Richtel/> Commissions earned by webcam models vary widely by website, but are usually based on a percentage of gross sales, although sometimes they are in the form of a flat fee. They may also earn money through advertising or earn commissions by convincing customers to sign up for membership at adult pornographic paysites.<ref name=Bartlett/> Many sites also encourage viewers to purchase items from online wish lists.<ref name=Bertrand/> Some webcam models cater to particular fetishes, such as a fascination with feet and might earn additional money by selling worn socks to patrons.<ref>{{cite book|title=Secrets of a Webcam Girl|last=Baxter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VCHCgAAQBAJ|first=Annabelle|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1620876671|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n  \nCamming sites specify rules and restrictions for their cam models, which in turn tend to give the camming site a distinct style and format. For example, one major free-access site, which only allows female models, fosters an environment where the camgirls are not necessarily obligated to do masturbation shows, or even display nudity.<ref name=MFCRules>{{cite web | title=Rules for Models - MFC | url=https://wiki.myfreecams.com/wiki/Rules_for_Models | accessdate=10 February 2018 | work=Wiki.MyFreeCams |date=5 February 2014}}</ref> Consequently, some of that site's models create a more relaxed \"hangout atmosphere\" within their rooms that occasionally resembles a [[talk show]].<ref name=Box/><ref name=Senft2/> Conversely, another major cam site, which allows men and couples to perform, tends to be more sexual and show-oriented.<ref name=CharRules>{{cite web | title=Basic Rules to Follow - Chaturbate's blog | url=https://blog.chaturbate.com/rules-and-guidelines/basic-rules-to-follow/ | accessdate=10 February 2018 | work= Chaturbate Blog |date=5 February 2014}}</ref> Other cam site rules might prohibit working in a public place so that the model does not get a public indecency arrest, the way that Kendra Sunderland was charged after her 2014 performance inside the Oregon State University Library.<ref name=McGehee/> Models who violate a camming site's rules may be subjected to a temporary or permanent ban from the cam site.\n\n===Social media===\n\nWebcam models often rely on social media to interact with existing customers and to meet new customers. This has some potential disadvantages, however, as mainstream social media platforms often have poorly-defined and changing rules that sex workers can inadvertently break. Having a social media account closed for any reason{{spndash}}legitimate or otherwise{{spndash}}can severely affect a performer's ability to earn income.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|title='I'm Hoping It Won't Decimate My Income': Tumblr's Porn Ban Is Yet Another Setback for Sex Workers|work=Jezebel|url=https://jezebel.com/i-m-hoping-it-won-t-decimate-my-income-tumblrs-porn-ba-1830879496|date=5 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|title=A Troll's Alleged Attempt to Purge Porn Performers from Instagram|work=Jezebel|url=https://jezebel.com/a-trolls-alleged-attempt-to-purge-porn-performers-from-1833940198|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome cam models have non-commercial personal web blogs.<ref>[http://cammingskillz.xyz/ Camming Skillz]</ref><ref>[https://balkan-webcam-model.com/ Balkan Webcam Model]</ref> They use it for contact with fans, blogging about the everyday life of a webcam model, and as a help and guide to would-be models. Because of social stigma attached to this occupation, mainstream media offers no real information about webcam modeling, just sensationalistic news (incidents and accidents, celebrities involvements...). So these blogs are the only window into the life of models.\n\n===Resources for performers===\n\nCam studios allow models to rent facilities outside of their home. These businesses can supply models with video equipment, Internet service, computer, lighting, and furniture. One example was the pornographic film company [[Kink.com]], which rented individual cam studios in the [[San Francisco Armory]] by the hour, from 2013 until the building was sold in 2018.<ref name=Richtel/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dineen|first1=J.K.|title=SF Armory sells for $65 million \u2014 to be used for manufacturing and offices|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-Armory-sells-for-65-million-to-be-used-12560076.php|accessdate=22 April 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWithin some studios the cam models can work by the percentage of business that they bring in, instead of renting studio time. The cam models do not have to pay to join this type of studio, but they are also not guaranteed a salary. These models can typically choose to charge customers between $1 and $15 per minute, and then the studio keeps half of the gross while the model gets the rest.<ref name=Song/>\n\nAnother workplace option is called a \"camgirl mansion\", which is a place that provides equipment and broadcast rooms where multiple camgirls can live and share expenses, but without a studio owner.<ref name=McGehee/>\n\nVarious support websites<!-- do not add specific examples without a reliable, independent source.--> supply general information about business strategies, upcoming conferences, tips for performance, and reviews of studio equipment. Support sites also give advice about how to protect privacy, discourage piracy, avoid Internet security lapses, and how to prevent financial scams.<ref name=Bertrand/><ref name=Richtel/>\n\nConferences and industry trade shows can also aid cam models by allowing cam models to network and meet others in the profession on a personal level.<ref name=McGehee/>\n\n==Legal issues==\n===Laws===\n\nLawrence Walters, a Florida lawyer who is an expert in obscenity law, said that there was nothing inherently illegal about web model camming shows, as long as the models were over 18 and performed at home or in a model's studio.<ref name=Richtel/>\n\nA sex work researcher, Rachel Stuart, notes an interesting paradox in British law which tends to focus on the uploading of pornographic recordings, but does not deal with erotic performance when streamed upon the Internet through camming. For instance, the [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] ban certain acts from being depicted and uploaded by pornography producers in the United Kingdom, and the [[Digital Economy Act 2017]] seeks to restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic material online. And yet both laws will have no effect if the performances are ''streamed'' as opposed to being ''recorded''. Stuart states of the legal conundrum in England, \"Performing an explicitly pornographic act via a webcam carries no repercussions, but if the same show is recorded and uploaded, the performer can be liable to a fine.\" <ref name=Rachel/>\n\nIn December 2017 the American [[FCC]] voted to do away with [[Net neutrality|Net Neutrality]] rules, which previously ensured that [[Internet service provider]]s treat all data on the Internet as the same, and to not charge differently by user.<ref name=Fiegerman1>{{cite news|last1=Fiegerman|first1=Seth|title=The end of net neutrality - What it all means |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-explainer/index.html |accessdate=28 January 2018|work=CNN|date=14 December 2017}}</ref> But without the Net Neutrality rules, Internet service providers could dramatically increase costs for companies that need significant bandwidth \u2013 like [[CD Baby]], [[Spotify]], and [[Netflix]].<ref name=Moss1>{{cite news|last1=Moss|first1=Marissa |title=Net Neutrality: How a Repeal Could Kill the Careers of Indie Musicians |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/net-neutrality-how-a-repeal-could-kill-artists-careers-w513787 |accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Rolling Stone | date=11 December 2017}}</ref> CD Baby is an online music store specializing in the sale of CDs and music downloads from independent musicians to consumers.

In the early 20th century, sociologist Paul Cressey noted that within the hundreds of [[taxi dance hall|taxi-dance halls]] of America, \"the traffic in romance and in feminine society\" would become available when [[taxi dancer]]s would offer their companionship and \"the illusion of romance\" for ten cents a dance.<ref name=\"Cressey1\">{{cite book| last=Cressey| first=Paul| title=The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life| date=1932| publisher=University of Chicago Press| location=Chicago, IL| isbn=9780226120515| pages=[https://archive.org/details/taxidancehall00paul/page/10 10\u201311, 129]| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/taxidancehall00paul/page/10}}</ref><ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite news| last1=Wright |first1=Evan | title=Dance With A Stranger |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/dance-with-a-stranger-2130263 | accessdate=6 February 2018| work=LA Weekly | date=20 January 1999}}</ref> The [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]] strip club is credited with the invention of the [[lap dance]] in 1977 when their new stage, New York Live, pioneered customer-contact shows with [[stripper]]s that came off the stage and sat in the laps of customers for tips.<ref name=McCumber1>{{cite book | first=David | last=McCumber | pages=78\u201380, 155 | title=X-Rated | location= New York | publisher=  Pinnacle Books | year=1992 | isbn=978-0786011131}}</ref> Enabled with this new revenue stream for strippers, the [[strip club]] industry went through a period of extreme growth during the 1980s. \n\nMuch of the success of camming owes to its ability to move beyond the borders of erotic video performance, and into the everyday social lives of camming customers. Webcam performers are often highly entrepreneurial, and use mainstream social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, and Tumblr to build and maintain relationships with their customers.<ref name=Rabouin/> Some fans communicate multiple times a day with models through social media. \n\nUnlike traditional pornography, the interactive nature of the camming medium titillates with the promise of ''virtual friendship''. [[Princeton University]] sociologist and author of ''The Purchase of Intimacy'', [[Viviana Zelizer]], states of camming: \"they're defining a new kind of intimacy. It's not traditional sex work, not a relationship, but something in between.\"<ref name=Richtel/>  Cam models perform not just sex work, but also perform through their hosting duties, conveying authenticity, creating and animating fantasies, and managing relationships over time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nayar|first=Kavita|title=Working it: the professionalization of amateurism in digital adult entertainment|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=17|year=2017|issue=3|pages=473\u2013488|doi=10.1080/14680777.2017.1303622}}</ref>\n\nWithin ''Cam Girlz'', a documentary film about the industry, male fans often say that they come to camming sites as a way to fulfill emotional needs. The film's director, Sean Dunne, states of the fans, \"they said it's not like a strip club \u2013 it's like a community, and you feel it when you\u2019re in these chat rooms. It's a community and entertainment that goes very far beyond sexuality.\"<ref name=Rabouin/>\n\nHowever Dr. Kari Lerum of the [[University of Washington]] suggests that men are more open and vulnerable in cam rooms than in strip clubs, and can become very invested in relationships which only exist on the screen.<ref name=Richtel/>. This proposition was supported by a 2019 study of over 6,000 webcam users by the webcam platform [[Stripchat]]. The study found that over 40% of its users had developed significant relationships with their cam models, ranging from friendship to deep emotional connections. <ref name=\"Ley\">{{cite news| last1=Ley |first1=David | title=Am iCheating? |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-who-stray/201907/am-icheating  | accessdate=20 August 2019| work=Psychology Today | date=23 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nThe term [[webcam]] is a [[clipped compound]] used to combine the terms [[World Wide Web]] and [[video camera]].\n\nWhen webcam models create their live [[webcast]]s, they perform the activity known as ''camming''.\n\nA third-party hosting website which transmits multiple webcam models' video-streams is known as a ''camming site''.\n\nWebcam models mostly perform individually in separate video [[chat rooms]], which are frequently referred to as ''rooms''.\n\nThe term \"camwhore\" was first used in print in November 2001;<ref>Torpy, Kathryn.

Camming revenue has been severely cutting into the profits of the pornographic movie business, which has also been eroded for a number of years by piracy and the distribution of free sexual content upon the Internet.<ref name=Richtel/> Additionally, the pornographic film industry used to be male-dominated except for the performers.

Section: Li';l'kving; Pge D4.</ref> These Internet hosting websites, known as ''camming sites'', take care of the technical work{{ndash}}hosting the video feed broadcast, processing payments, providing an intuitive interface, advertising{{ndash}}so that the cam model only has to focus on the actual shows for their video chat room. Most cam models are [[independent contractor]]s for camming sites, and are not employees.<ref name=McGehee/>\n\nBy presenting hundreds of different models via individual chat rooms, a camming site becomes a talent aggregator and middleman \u2013 but only in the sense that Apple is the middleman for bands selling music on iTunes.<ref name=Richtel/> Though a camming website may carry many hundreds of models, they frequently provide an interface for the viewer to easily switch between the most-visited models' rooms, and that interface occasionally resembles the multiple channel selection of [[cable television]].<ref name=McGehee/>\n\nCamming sites typically supply each webcam model with an individual profile webpage where the performer can describe themselves, and more importantly create a virtual store where they can sell items like videos, photos, personal clothing, and memberships to their fan club. The profile page's virtual store creates a stream of passive income, meaning that even if a camgirl is not online and performing, she can still generate money while fans come to the ever-present profile page to purchase its wares. Some of the most popular items are homemade videos that cam models make of themselves.<ref name=Hess/> While most these videos are sexual in nature, they often include elements of comedy, fashion, and a narration of their lifestyles. The affordability of and access to new video recording technology has spawned new variations and genres of pornography since individual women, as well as industry players, can now create content.<ref name=Hess/> A profile page might also sell contact information like a personal phone number, a spot on a model's Snapchat contact list, or the ability to send her private messages through a camming site's friends list.<ref name=McGehee/> The profile page may also suggest tip amounts for real-time performance requests, like a sexy dance, a song request, removal of clothing, or a particular sex act.<ref name=McGehee/> All prices on a profile page are listed in quantities of tips, which are electronic tokens that the viewer can buy in bunches from the cam site to be given to various models during performance, or in later purchases upon the profile page.<ref name=Richtel/><ref name=Bertrand>{{cite news|last1=Bertrand|first1=Natasha|title=How Webcam Models Make Money|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-webcam-models-make-money-2014-11|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=New York Times|date=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe camming site keeps a percentage of the tips, but the amount varies. Big earners can get a bigger chunk of their tips.<ref name=Richtel/> Commissions earned by webcam models vary widely by website, but are usually based on a percentage of gross sales, although sometimes they are in the form of a flat fee. They may also earn money through advertising or earn commissions by convincing customers to sign up for membership at adult pornographic paysites.<ref name=Bartlett/> Many sites also encourage viewers to purchase items from online wish lists.<ref name=Bertrand/> Some webcam models cater to particular fetishes, such as a fascination with feet and might earn additional money by selling worn socks to patrons.<ref>{{cite book|title=Secrets of a Webcam Girl|last=Baxter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VCHCgAAQBAJ|first=Annabelle|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1620876671|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n  \nCamming sites specify rules and restrictions for their cam models, which in turn tend to give the camming site a distinct style and format. For example, one major free-access site, which only allows female models, fosters an environment where the camgirls are not necessarily obligated to do masturbation shows, or even display nudity.<ref name=MFCRules>{{cite web | title=Rules for Models - MFC | url=https://wiki.myfreecams.com/wiki/Rules_for_Models | accessdate=10 February 2018 | work=Wiki.MyFreeCams |date=5 February 2014}}</ref> Consequently, some of that site's models create a more relaxed \"hangout atmosphere\" within their rooms that occasionally resembles a [[talk show]].<ref name=Box/><ref name=Senft2/> Conversely, another major cam site, which allows men and couples to perform, tends to be more sexual and show-oriented.<ref name=CharRules>{{cite web | title=Basic Rules to Follow - Chaturbate's blog | url=https://blog.chaturbate.com/rules-and-guidelines/basic-rules-to-follow/ | accessdate=10 February 2018 | work= Chaturbate Blog |date=5 February 2014}}</ref> Other cam site rules might prohibit working in a public place so that the model does not get a public indecency arrest, the way that Kendra Sunderland was charged after her 2014 performance inside the Oregon State University Library.<ref name=McGehee/> Models who violate a camming site's rules may be subjected to a temporary or permanent ban from the cam site.\n\n===Social media===\n\nWebcam models often rely on social media to interact with existing customers and to meet new customers. This has some potential disadvantages, however, as mainstream social media platforms often have poorly-defined and changing rules that sex workers can inadvertently break. Having a social media account closed for any reason{{spndash}}legitimate or otherwise{{spndash}}can severely affect a performer's ability to earn income.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|title='I'm Hoping It Won't Decimate My Income':\u00a0Tumblr's Porn Ban Is Yet Another Setback for Sex Workers|work=Jezebel|url=https://jezebel.com/i-m-hoping-it-won-t-decimate-my-income-tumblrs-porn-ba-1830879496|date=5 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|title=A Troll's Alleged Attempt to Purge Porn Performers from Instagram|work=Jezebel|url=https://jezebel.com/a-trolls-alleged-attempt-to-purge-porn-performers-from-1833940198|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome cam models have non-commercial personal web blogs.<ref>[http://cammingskillz.xyz/ Camming Skillz]</ref><ref>[https://balkan-webcam-model.com/ Balkan Webcam Model]</ref> They use it for contact with fans, blogging about the everyday life of a webcam model, and as a help and guide to would-be models. Because of social stigma attached to this occupation, mainstream media offers no real information about webcam modeling, just sensationalistic news (incidents and accidents, celebrities involvements...). So these blogs are the only window into the life of models.\n\n===Resources for performers===\n\nCam studios allow models to rent facilities outside of their home. These businesses can supply models with video equipment, Internet service, computer, lighting, and furniture. One example was the pornographic film company [[Kink.com]], which rented individual cam studios in the [[San Francisco Armory]] by the hour, from 2013 until the building was sold in 2018.<ref name=Richtel/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dineen|first1=J.K.|title=SF Armory sells for $65 million \u2014 to be used for manufacturing and offices|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-Armory-sells-for-65-million-to-be-used-12560076.php|accessdate=22 April 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWithin some studios the cam models can work by the percentage of business that they bring in, instead of renting studio time. The cam models do not have to pay to join this type of studio, but they are also not guaranteed a salary. These models can typically choose to charge customers between $1 and $15 per minute, and then the studio keeps half of the gross while the model gets the rest.<ref name=Song/>\n\nAnother workplace option is called a \"camgirl mansion\", which is a place that provides equipment and broadcast rooms where multiple camgirls can live and share expenses, but without a studio owner.<ref name=McGehee/>\n\nVarious support websites<!-- do not add specific examples without a reliable, independent source.--> supply general information about business strategies, upcoming conferences, tips for performance, and reviews of studio equipment. Support sites also give advice about how to protect privacy, discourage piracy, avoid Internet security lapses, and how to prevent financial scams.<ref name=Bertrand/><ref name=Richtel/>\n\nConferences and industry trade shows can also aid cam models by allowing cam models to network and meet others in the profession on a personal level.<ref name=McGehee/>\n\n==Legal issues==\n===Laws===\n\nLawrence Walters, a Florida lawyer who is an expert in obscenity law, said that there was nothing inherently illegal about web model camming shows, as long as the models were over 18 and performed at home or in a model's studio.<ref name=Richtel/>\n\nA sex work researcher, Rachel Stuart, notes an interesting paradox in British law which tends to focus on the uploading of pornographic recordings, but does not deal with erotic performance when streamed upon the Internet through camming. For instance, the [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] ban certain acts from being depicted and uploaded by pornography producers in the United Kingdom, and the [[Digital Economy Act 2017]] seeks to restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic material online. And yet both laws will have no effect if the performances are ''streamed'' as opposed to being ''recorded''. Stuart states of the legal conundrum in England, \"Performing an explicitly pornographic act via a webcam carries no repercussions, but if the same show is recorded and uploaded, the performer can be liable to a fine.\" <ref name=Rachel/>\n\nIn December 2017 the American [[FCC]] voted to do away with [[Net neutrality|Net Neutrality]] rules, which previously ensured that [[Internet service provider]]s treat all data on the Internet as the same, and to not charge differently by user.<ref name=Fiegerman1>{{cite news|last1=Fiegerman|first1=Seth|title=The end of net neutrality - What it all means |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-explainer/index.html |accessdate=28 January 2018|work=CNN|date=14 December 2017}}</ref> But without the Net Neutrality rules, Internet service providers could dramatically increase costs for companies that need significant bandwidth \u2013 like [[CD Baby]], [[Spotify]], and [[Netflix]].<ref name=Moss1>{{cite news|last1=Moss|first1=Marissa |title=Net Neutrality: How a Repeal Could Kill the Careers of Indie Musicians |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/net-neutrality-how-a-repeal-could-kill-artists-careers-w513787 |accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Rolling Stone | date=11 December 2017}}</ref> CD Baby is an online music store specializing in the sale of CDs and music downloads from independent musicians to consumers. Like camming's hosting sites, CD Baby is an aggregator of independent performers' digital media in the same way that camming sites enable cam models to sell their videos for tips.<ref name=Ludwick1>{{cite news|last1=Ludwick | first1=Robert | title=What the repeal of Net Neutrality could mean for musicians | url=http://diymusician.cdbaby.com/business/repeal-net-neutrality-mean-musicians/ | accessdate=28 January 2018|work=DIY Musician|date=21 December 2017}}</ref> Since the free-access business model of the camming industry also relies on large bandwidth, these possible new costs could eventually be passed on to camming hosting sites, as well as to the cam models themselves. A politically alert camgirl, Melonie, states: \"How many camgirls and webcam customers are going to be able to afford a $200+ monthly bill from their ISP for a high bandwidth connection capable of HD video streaming? How many camgirls are going to be able to continue to devote time to create webcam host programming if the payout percentage is reduced from 30% to 15%?\"  \n<ref name=StripperWeb1>{{cite web | title=Camming Connection - Net Neutrality and Webcam Modeling | url=https://www.stripperweb.com/forum/showthread.php?190926-net-neutrality-and-webcam-modeling | accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Stripper Web|date=20 February 2014}}</ref> As of early 2018, the new ruling has yet to be leveraged by ISP's to increase costs. However bandwidth hungry companies like Netflix and CD Baby nervously await the eventual Internet service providers' response to the new FCC ruling that they lobbied so hard to bring about.<ref name=Coldewey1>{{cite news|last1=Coldewey|first1=Devin|title=The FCC just repealed net neutrality.

She was then charged with public indecency after the show was recorded by someone who was watching MyFreeCams.com online, and then posted it on other sites. Sunderland faced fines up to $6,250 and one year of jail.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Stuart|title=Former OSU student cited for public indecency in library filming faces up to 1 year in jail, $6,250 fine|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/01/former_osu_student_cited_for_p.html|accessdate=19 December 2016|work=The Oregonian|date=29 January 2015}}</ref> She pleaded guilty, paid $1,000, and avoided jail. The incident generated headlines around the country and landed Sunderland reported deals with [[Playboy]], and a contract with [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'s parent company [[Friend Finder Networks]] purportedly worth six figures.<ref name=Richtel/> The incident greatly increased Sunderland's popularity, and she has continued to do camming and speak positively of it as a career.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Silverstein|first1=Jason|title=EXCLUSIVE: Oregon State webcam girl Kendra Sunderland opens up in first interview: 'I've always been the type of girl who's not afraid to show off'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/oregon-webcam-girl-kendra-sunderland-interview-article-1.2105248|accessdate=19 December 2016|work=New York Daily News|date=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=Rabouin/>\n\nIn Arizona during 2015, a fan took his appreciation of camgirls to an illegal level when he was indicted for spending $476,000 on a company credit card, which he used for tips on camming websites. He spent more than $100,000 on MyFreeCams.com alone, and sent $26,800 to one cam model in particular to pay for her college tuition bill and new tires for her car. According to the indictment, he also purchased flowers, chocolates, electronic equipment, shoes, a TV, a handbag, laptop computer, and an iPod for some of his favorite camgirls.<ref name=Rabouin/>\n\nWebcam models have occasionally been the targets of cyber-stalkers and blackmailers. Sex work researcher, Rachel Stuart, reported that while doing her PhD research she encountered webcam models who were concerned about viewers filming and sharing their performances on porn sites, or acquiring personal information which could be used to stalk or blackmail them.<ref name=Rachel/> In 2013, the New York Times interviewed a woman who prefers to conceal her real identity while working as a camgirl. She revealed that she had been cyber-stalked by a heavy tipper who started making threats and demands about what outfits she should wear. A short while later, she found out that her real name and address had been posted on the Internet along with her cam name. When she complained to the police, they said that they could do nothing, because \"putting real information on the Internet is not illegal.\" She later found out that the same individual had also threatened and outed several other camgirls.<ref name=Richtel/>\n\nA ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report described the story of [[Justin Berry]], a 13-year-old boy who, after hooking up his webcam and listing himself on an online forum in order to make friends, was propositioned by older men to strip and [[Masturbation|masturbate]] on camera.
