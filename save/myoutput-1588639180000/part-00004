In November 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai Peninsula]]. The war was fought in and drew upon each power's colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]] and across the globe. The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and their allies would become known as the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThe German advance into France was halted at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and by the end of 1914, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[battle of attrition]], marked by a long series of [[trench warfare|trench lines]] that changed little until 1917 (the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and opened a [[Alpine Front|front in the Alps]]. [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Central Powers in 1915 and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] joined the Allies in 1917, expanding the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|war in the Balkans]]. The United States initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war [[materiel]] to the Allies. Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and [[Zimmermann Telegram|the revelation]] that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the [[American entry into World War I|U.S. declared war on Germany]] on 6{{nbsp}}April 1917. Trained American forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] would reach some two million troops.<ref>Edward M.

The 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy]] with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the [[October Revolution]], the creation of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the [[Spring Offensive|German March 1918 Offensive]]. This offensive was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the German reserves. The Allies rallied and drove the Germans back in their [[Hundred Days Offensive]], a continual series of attacks to which the Germans had no reply.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheffield |first1=Gary |title=Forgotten Victory |date=2002 |publisher=Review |isbn=978-0747271574 |page=251}}</ref> Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice\u2014the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918.

Victory in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] established Prussian hegemony in Germany, while victory over France in the 1870\u20131871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] [[Unification of Germany|unified]] the German states into a [[German Empire|German Reich]] under Prussian leadership.\n\nIn 1873, to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. Concerned by Russia's victory in the 1877\u20131878 [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]] and their influence in the [[Balkans]], the League was dissolved in 1878, with Germany and Austria-Hungary subsequently forming the 1879 [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]]; this became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] when Italy joined in 1882.<ref>{{cite book |first=H.

Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for fewer numbers; it was concern at the closing of this gap that led to the end of the naval race, rather than a reduction in tension elsewhere. When Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 men in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures taken by the [[Balkans|Balkan powers]] and Italy led to increased expenditure by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and Austria-Hungary. Absolute figures are hard to calculate, due to differences in categorising expenditure, while they often omit civilian infrastructure projects with a military use, such as railways. However, from 1908 to 1913, defence spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50% in real terms.{{sfn|Stevenson|2016|p=42}}\n\n===Conflicts in the Balkans===\n[[File:1908-10-07 - Moritz Schiller's Delicatessen.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of large white building with one signs saying \"Moritz Schiller\" and another in Arabic; in front is a cluster of people looking at poster on the wall.|Sarajevo citizens reading a poster with the proclamation of the [[Bosnian Crisis|Austrian annexation in 1908]]]]\n\nIn October 1908, Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908\u20131909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|had occupied]] since 1878. This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].

When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it sparked the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], by the end of which it lost most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to Serbia and Greece, and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania, further destabilising the region.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |pp=2\u201323}} The [[Great Powers]] were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Sarajevo assassination===\n{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}\n[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|thumb |This picture is usually associated with the arrest of [[Gavrilo Princip]], although some<ref name=\"FinestoneMassie\">{{cite book |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Finestone |first2=Robert K. |last2=Massie |title=The last courts of Europe |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-1cvAAAAMAAJ |page=247}} |year=1981 |publisher=Dent |page=247}}</ref>{{sfn|Smith |2010}} believe it depicts Ferdinand Behr, a bystander.]]\n\nOn 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir presumptive to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]].

The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces, which Austria-Hungary had annexed from the Ottoman Empire, so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia.\n\n\u010cabrinovi\u0107 threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed.

The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them.\n\nAbout an hour later, when Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital with those wounded in the assassination attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by coincidence, Princip stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Ferdinand and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. Although they were reportedly not personally close, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was profoundly shocked and upset.

[[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George's]] War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the \"submarine outrages\". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of \"a direct exchange of views\". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a \"free and united Poland\".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.{{sfn |Kernek |1970 |pp=721\u2013766}} The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.\n\n===1917\u20131918===\nEvents of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.\n\n====Developments in 1917====\n[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'\u00e9cluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|French Army lookout at his observation post, [[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]\n\nThe British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months, before American intervention could have an effect. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.\n\nOn 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>Marshall, 292.</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0323-501, Kriegskinematograph im Sch\u00fctzengraben.jpg|thumb|German<!--UFA?--> film crew recording the action]]\n\nThe victory of the Central Powers at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to co-ordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.\n\nIn December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.{{sfn|Heyman |1997 |pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nIn 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, through his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany.

They were replaced by Indian Army units. During several months of reorganisation and training of the summer, a [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Summer front line operations|number of attacks]] were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line. These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the Entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.\n\nThe reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force, with an additional mounted division, broke Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918.

The Desert Mounted Corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry.

Germany did this realising it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.{{sfn |Tuchman |1966}} The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK. From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.<ref name=\"Karp-PoW-1979\">{{harvnb |Karp |1979}}</ref> After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany on 2{{nbsp}}April 1917,<ref>[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|\"Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany\"]] (Wikisource)</ref> which the [[US Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared 4{{nbsp}}days later]].\n\nThe United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled \"Associated Power\".

General Foch pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing still sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March 1918.\n\n====German Spring Offensive of 1918====\n{{Main|Spring Offensive}}\n[[File:General gouraud french army world war i machinegun marne 1918.JPEG|thumb|French soldiers under [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]], with machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], 1918]]\n\nLudendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.{{sfn |Westwell |2004}}\n\nBritish and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. In the Spring Offensive of 1918, however, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.{{sfn |Posen |1984 |p=190}}{{Citation not found}}\n\n[[File:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|left|British [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th Division]] soldiers blinded by tear gas during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Estaires]], 10 April 1918]]\n\nThe front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.{{sfn |Gray |1991 |p=86}}\n\nFollowing Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Bl\u00fccher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne ([[Second Battle of the Marne]]) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]]. The resulting counter-attack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war. By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,{{sfn |Rickard |2007}} having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.\n\n====New states enter the war====\nIn the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire. Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917\u201318, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians [[Treaty of Poti|asked for and received protection]] from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance.

The war must be ended.\" On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could continue the war only until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations.

The German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium.

It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food.

Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]], which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel mutiny|Kiel]], spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9{{nbsp}}November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kurkuhl.de/docs/kieler_14punkte.pdf |author=K.

On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3{{nbsp}}November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Giusti).

Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some {{convert|720|km|mi}} from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],{{sfn |Baker |2006}}{{sfn |Chickering |2004 |pp=185\u2013188}} which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its \"patriotic calling\" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58&nbsp;billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25&nbsp;billion.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was soon replaced by Turkey and several other countries in the Middle East.\n\nIn the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations' \"Baptism of Fire\". It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]].

By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |p=154}} [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |pp=82\u201386}} and aircraft.

In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].<ref>Sterling, Christopher H.; Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008).

The British had a 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.{{sfn |Mosier |2001 |pp=42\u201348}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Jager |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |date=2001 |page=224 |isbn=978-1861264039}}</ref>\n\n[[File:38cmBttrPommern.jpg|thumb|38-cm \"[[Batterie Pommern|Lange Max]]\" of [[Koekelare]] (Leugenboom), biggest gun in the world in 1917]]\n\nOn 27 June 1917 the Germans used the biggest gun in the world, [[Batterie Pommern]], nicknamed \"[[Lange Max Museum|Lange Max]]\". This gun from Krupp was able to shoot 750&nbsp;kg shells from [[Koekelare]] to [[Dunkirk]], a distance of about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nMuch of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War{{nbsp}}I. Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.{{sfn |Hartcup |1988}} Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=421}} and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.\n\n{{quote |source=|\n<poem>Gas!

Gases used included chlorine, [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas,{{sfn |Raudzens |1990}} as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] (as opposed to [[tactical bombing]]) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,{{sfn |Heller |1984}} though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar pulp novels on future \"gas wars\" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.</ref>\n\nThe most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece.<ref>{{YouTube|Hl4jJJ9b9MA|\"Heavy Railroad Artillery\"}}</ref> The German version were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb).\n\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917]]\n\nTrenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War{{nbsp}}I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the [[Renault FT]], which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].\n\nAnother new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.\n\n[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.\n\n====Areas taken in major attacks====\n[[File:Attack areas in WW1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.0]]\n\nOn the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Cambrai {{mdash}} the exception was Nivelle's Offensive in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army. In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: Michael, on the Lys, and on the Aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics. The Allies struck back at [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]], which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at Amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.\n\nThe areas in the East were larger. The Germans did well at the First Masurian Lakes driving the invaders from East Prussia, and at [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]], which led the Russians to sue for peace. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans joined for a great success at Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w, which drove the Russians out of Poland. In a series of attacks along with the Bulgarians they occupied Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and most of Romania. The Allies successes came later in [[Third Battle of Gaza|Palestine]], the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in Macedonia, which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at Vittorio Veneto, the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians. The area occupied in East by the Central powers on 11 November 1918 was {{cvt|1042600|km2|sqmi}}.\n\n===Naval===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-15, Panzerkreuzer \"SMS Goeben\".jpg|thumb|The {{sclass-|Moltke|battlecruiser|0}} {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem}}]]\n\nGermany deployed U-boats (submarines) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive [[sonar]], 1917), blimps, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref name=\"price1980\"/> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916).

Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s,{{sfn |Winter |1983}} so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb |Johnson |2001}}</ref>\n\nRecognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name=\"Cross 1991\"/><ref name=FullCircle/>\n\n==War crimes==\n\n===Baralong incidents===\n{{Main|Baralong incidents}}\n[[File:HMS Baralong.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Baralong'']]\n\nOn 19 August 1915, the German submarine [[SM U-27 (Germany)|U-27]] was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] {{HMS|Baralong}}.

Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.{{sfn |Havighurst |1985 |p=131}} Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the [[Military Service Act 1916|Military Service Act]] in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of [[Military Service Tribunals]] to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy.<ref>Chelmsford, J.E. \"Clergy and Man-Power\", ''[[The Times]]'' 15 April 1918, p. 12</ref> Conscription lasted until mid-1919.

This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3{{nbsp}}million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).\n\nForms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on 7{{nbsp}}January 1918.\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\nLike all the armies of mainland Europe, Austria-Hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans. This was much resented. The army has been described as being \"run on colonial lines\" and the Slav soldiers as \"disaffected\". Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Catastrophe: Europe goes to War 1914 |last=Hastings |first=Max |publisher=Collins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-00-746764-8 |location=London |pages=30, 140}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I}}\nThe non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: [[Propaganda in World War I|propaganda campaigns]]; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs.

Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body.

Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King & Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}} Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<ref name=\"Hynes1991\">{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=Samuel Lynn |authorlink=Samuel Hynes |title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture |year=1991 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=978-0-689-12128-9 |pages=i\u2013xii}}</ref> Several historians like [[John Terraine]], [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:\n\n<blockquote>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events.

It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}}</blockquote>\n\nThough these views have been discounted as \"myths\",<ref name=\"Hynes1991\"/><ref name=\"Fussell2000\">{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |title=The Great War and modern memory |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=D9iNQYfeKdwC}} |accessdate=18 May 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513332-5 |pages=1\u201378}}</ref> they are common.

Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi\u2013xv}}\n\n===Discontent in Germany===\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[stab-in-the-back myth|stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the \"stab-in-the-back\" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.\n\nCommunist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war.

All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War{{nbsp}}I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC}} |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=7 |isbn=978-0-582-50601-5}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Economic effects===\n{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}\n[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915]]\n\nOne of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.\n\n[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the United States), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% and 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.\n\nIn all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]<ref>10{{sup|9}} in this context&nbsp;\u2013 see [[Long and short scales]]</ref> of World War{{nbsp}}I debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/562830/First-World-War-debt-paid-off |title=Britain FINALLY pays off last of First World War debt as George Osborne redeems \u00a31.9bn |first=Peter |last=Henn |date=9 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Lucy |title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907\u20131948 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=978-0-415-39056-9 |page=48}}</ref>\n\nWorld War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.\n\nIn Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.\n\nBritain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn |Green |1938 |p=cxxvi}}\n\nArticle 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called \"war guilt\" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Anton Kaes |editor2=Martin Jay |editor3=Edward Dimendberg |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4A1gt4-VCsC&pg=PA8 |chapter=The Treaty of Versailles: The Reparations Clauses |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |page=8 |isbn=978-0520909601}}</ref> It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary.

In November 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai Peninsula]]. The war was fought in and drew upon each power's colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]] and across the globe. The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and their allies would become known as the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThe German advance into France was halted at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and by the end of 1914, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[battle of attrition]], marked by a long series of [[trench warfare|trench lines]] that changed little until 1917 (the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and opened a [[Alpine Front|front in the Alps]]. [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Central Powers in 1915 and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] joined the Allies in 1917, expanding the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|war in the Balkans]]. The United States initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war [[materiel]] to the Allies. Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and [[Zimmermann Telegram|the revelation]] that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the [[American entry into World War I|U.S. declared war on Germany]] on 6{{nbsp}}April 1917. Trained American forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] would reach some two million troops.<ref>Edward M.

The 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy]] with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the [[October Revolution]], the creation of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the [[Spring Offensive|German March 1918 Offensive]]. This offensive was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the German reserves. The Allies rallied and drove the Germans back in their [[Hundred Days Offensive]], a continual series of attacks to which the Germans had no reply.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheffield |first1=Gary |title=Forgotten Victory |date=2002 |publisher=Review |isbn=978-0747271574 |page=251}}</ref> Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice\u2014the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918.

When Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 men in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures taken by the [[Balkans|Balkan powers]] and Italy led to increased expenditure by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and Austria-Hungary.

After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the \"submarine outrages\". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of \"a direct exchange of views\". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a \"free and united Poland\".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.{{sfn |Kernek |1970 |pp=721\u2013766}} The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.\n\n===1917\u20131918===\nEvents of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.\n\n====Developments in 1917====\n[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'\u00e9cluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|French Army lookout at his observation post, [[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]\n\nThe British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months, before American intervention could have an effect. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.\n\nOn 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>Marshall, 292.</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0323-501, Kriegskinematograph im Sch\u00fctzengraben.jpg|thumb|German<!--UFA?--> film crew recording the action]]\n\nThe victory of the Central Powers at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to co-ordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.\n\nIn December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe.

Germany did this realising it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.{{sfn |Tuchman |1966}} The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK. From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe.

General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the Allied forces. Haig, Petain, and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a co-ordinating rather than a directing role, and the British, French, and US commands operated largely independently. General Foch pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing still sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March 1918.\n\n====German Spring Offensive of 1918====\n{{Main|Spring Offensive}}\n[[File:General gouraud french army world war i machinegun marne 1918.JPEG|thumb|French soldiers under [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]], with machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], 1918]]\n\nLudendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.{{sfn |Westwell |2004}}\n\nBritish and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. In the Spring Offensive of 1918, however, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.{{sfn |Posen |1984 |p=190}}{{Citation not found}}\n\n[[File:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|left|British [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th Division]] soldiers blinded by tear gas during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Estaires]], 10 April 1918]]\n\nThe front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.{{sfn |Gray |1991 |p=86}}\n\nFollowing Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Bl\u00fccher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne ([[Second Battle of the Marne]]) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]]. The resulting counter-attack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war. By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,{{sfn |Rickard |2007}} having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.\n\n====New states enter the war====\nIn the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire. Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917\u201318, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians [[Treaty of Poti|asked for and received protection]] from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance. Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks before defeating them at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]].{{sfn|Hovannisian |1967 |pp=1\u201339}}\n\n===Allied victory: summer 1918 onwards===\n\n====Hundred Days Offensive====\n{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Weimar Republic}}\n[[File:Riflemen-1918-Western-Front.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Between April and November 1918, the Allies increased their front-line rifle strength while German strength fell by half.{{sfn |Ayers |1919 |p=104}}]]\n[[File:Aerial view of ruins of Vaux, France, 1918, ca. 03-1918 - ca. 11-1918 - NARA - 512862.tif|thumb|upright=0.9|Aerial view of ruins of [[Vaux-devant-Damloup]], France, 1918]]\n\nThe Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8{{nbsp}}August 1918, with the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]].

Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.<ref name=\"Pitt-1962\">{{harvnb |Pitt |2003}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the Offensive began, Ludendorff said: \"We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either.\" On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, \"I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended.\" On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could continue the war only until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations.

The German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium.

It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food.

This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3{{nbsp}}November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Giusti). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted.

Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some {{convert|720|km|mi}} from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],{{sfn |Baker |2006}}{{sfn |Chickering |2004 |pp=185\u2013188}} which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its \"patriotic calling\" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58&nbsp;billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25&nbsp;billion. Among the Allies, the UK spent $21&nbsp;billion and the US$17&nbsp;billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gerd |last=Hardach |title=The First World War, 1914\u20131918 |url=https://archive.org/details/firstworldwar1910000hard |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1977 |page=[https://archive.org/details/firstworldwar1910000hard/page/153 153] |isbn=0-520-03060-5 |postscript=none }}, using estimated made by {{cite book |first=H. |last=Menderhausen |title=The Economics of War |location=New York |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1941 |page=305 |oclc=774042 }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}\nIn the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian.

However, the negotiation of the treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife, and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]] was not signed until 24 July 1923, at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]].\n\nSome [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the Treaty of Lausanne, was signed. Under its terms, the Allied forces left [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.\n\n===Peace treaties and national boundaries===\n[[File:Venizelos signing the Treaty of Sevres.jpeg|thumb|left|Greek prime minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] signing the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]]]\n\nAfter the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war.

Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3&nbsp;million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up approximately 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (according to the [[Ethnic and religious composition of Austria-Hungary#Transleithanian states|1910 census]]), only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary.

This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], leading to the victorious [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the much less stringent 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nThough by 1923 most countries had made peace treaties, [[Andorra]] was an exception. Andorra declared war on Germany in August 1914. At that time, it had an army of 600 part-time military men, commanded by two officials.

By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |p=154}} [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |pp=82\u201386}} and aircraft.

In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].<ref>Sterling, Christopher H.; Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008).

The German Army employed {{convert|150|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[howitzer]]s in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only {{convert|75|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The British had a 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.{{sfn |Mosier |2001 |pp=42\u201348}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Jager |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |date=2001 |page=224 |isbn=978-1861264039}}</ref>\n\n[[File:38cmBttrPommern.jpg|thumb|38-cm \"[[Batterie Pommern|Lange Max]]\" of [[Koekelare]] (Leugenboom), biggest gun in the world in 1917]]\n\nOn 27 June 1917 the Germans used the biggest gun in the world, [[Batterie Pommern]], nicknamed \"[[Lange Max Museum|Lange Max]]\". This gun from Krupp was able to shoot 750&nbsp;kg shells from [[Koekelare]] to [[Dunkirk]], a distance of about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nMuch of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War{{nbsp}}I. Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.{{sfn |Hartcup |1988}} Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=421}} and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.\n\n{{quote |source=|\n<poem>Gas!

Gases used included chlorine, [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas,{{sfn |Raudzens |1990}} as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] (as opposed to [[tactical bombing]]) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,{{sfn |Heller |1984}} though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar pulp novels on future \"gas wars\" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.</ref>\n\nThe most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece.<ref>{{YouTube|Hl4jJJ9b9MA|\"Heavy Railroad Artillery\"}}</ref> The German version were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb).\n\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917]]\n\nTrenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War{{nbsp}}I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the [[Renault FT]], which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].\n\nAnother new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.\n\n[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.\n\n====Areas taken in major attacks====\n[[File:Attack areas in WW1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.0]]\n\nOn the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Cambrai {{mdash}} the exception was Nivelle's Offensive in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army. In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: Michael, on the Lys, and on the Aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics. The Allies struck back at [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]], which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at Amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.\n\nThe areas in the East were larger. The Germans did well at the First Masurian Lakes driving the invaders from East Prussia, and at [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]], which led the Russians to sue for peace. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans joined for a great success at Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w, which drove the Russians out of Poland. In a series of attacks along with the Bulgarians they occupied Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and most of Romania. The Allies successes came later in [[Third Battle of Gaza|Palestine]], the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in Macedonia, which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at Vittorio Veneto, the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians. The area occupied in East by the Central powers on 11 November 1918 was {{cvt|1042600|km2|sqmi}}.\n\n===Naval===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-15, Panzerkreuzer \"SMS Goeben\".jpg|thumb|The {{sclass-|Moltke|battlecruiser|0}} {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem}}]]\n\nGermany deployed U-boats (submarines) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive [[sonar]], 1917), blimps, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref name=\"price1980\"/> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916).

By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, [[anti-aircraft guns]] and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bomber]]s were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.<ref name=\"Cross 1991\">{{harvnb |Cross |1991}}</ref> Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with HMS ''Furious'' launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.{{sfn |Cross |1991 |pp=56\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Richthofen and Falkenhayn with Fokker Dr.I c1918.jpg|thumb|right|[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] [[Fokker Dr.I]] being inspected by [[Manfred von Richthofen]], also known as the Red Baron, one of most famous pilots in the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/richthofen2.php|title=Manfred von Richthofen|website=theaerodrome.com|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>]]\n\nManned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery.

At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb |Johnson |2001}}</ref>\n\nRecognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name=\"Cross 1991\"/><ref name=FullCircle/>\n\n==War crimes==\n\n===Baralong incidents===\n{{Main|Baralong incidents}}\n[[File:HMS Baralong.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Baralong'']]\n\nOn 19 August 1915, the German submarine [[SM U-27 (Germany)|U-27]] was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] {{HMS|Baralong}}.

Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.{{sfn |Havighurst |1985 |p=131}} Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the [[Military Service Act 1916|Military Service Act]] in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of [[Military Service Tribunals]] to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy.<ref>Chelmsford, J.E. \"Clergy and Man-Power\", ''[[The Times]]'' 15 April 1918, p. 12</ref> Conscription lasted until mid-1919.

This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3{{nbsp}}million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).\n\nForms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on 7{{nbsp}}January 1918.\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\nLike all the armies of mainland Europe, Austria-Hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans. This was much resented. The army has been described as being \"run on colonial lines\" and the Slav soldiers as \"disaffected\". Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Catastrophe: Europe goes to War 1914 |last=Hastings |first=Max |publisher=Collins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-00-746764-8 |location=London |pages=30, 140}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I}}\nThe non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: [[Propaganda in World War I|propaganda campaigns]]; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs.

Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: Why the war began, why the Allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Heather |last=Jones |title=As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography |journal=[[Historical Journal]] |year=2013 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=857\u2013878 [p. 858] |doi=10.1017/S0018246X13000216 }}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\n{{Main|World War I memorials}}\n[[File:Pagny le Chateau monument morts 002b.jpg|thumb|A typical village [[war memorial]] to soldiers killed in World War I]]\n\nMemorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.

Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King & Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}} Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<ref name=\"Hynes1991\">{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=Samuel Lynn |authorlink=Samuel Hynes |title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture |year=1991 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=978-0-689-12128-9 |pages=i\u2013xii}}</ref> Several historians like [[John Terraine]], [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:\n\n<blockquote>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular clich\u00e9 of World War{{nbsp}}I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}}</blockquote>\n\nThough these views have been discounted as \"myths\",<ref name=\"Hynes1991\"/><ref name=\"Fussell2000\">{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |title=The Great War and modern memory |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=D9iNQYfeKdwC}} |accessdate=18 May 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513332-5 |pages=1\u201378}}</ref> they are common.

Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi\u2013xv}}\n\n===Discontent in Germany===\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] and [[Fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the stab-in-the-back legend (German: ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the \"stab-in-the-back\" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.\n\nCommunist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity by using German discontent with the still controversial Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace |first=Martin |last=Kitchen}}</ref> World War{{nbsp}}II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War{{nbsp}}I.

All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War{{nbsp}}I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC}} |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=7 |isbn=978-0-582-50601-5}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Economic effects===\n{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}\n[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915]]\n\nOne of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.\n\n[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the United States), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% and 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.\n\nIn all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]<ref>10{{sup|9}} in this context&nbsp;\u2013 see [[Long and short scales]]</ref> of World War{{nbsp}}I debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/562830/First-World-War-debt-paid-off |title=Britain FINALLY pays off last of First World War debt as George Osborne redeems \u00a31.9bn |first=Peter |last=Henn |date=9 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Lucy |title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907\u20131948 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=978-0-415-39056-9 |page=48}}</ref>\n\nWorld War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.\n\nIn Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.\n\nBritain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn |Green |1938 |p=cxxvi}}\n\nArticle 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called \"war guilt\" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Anton Kaes |editor2=Martin Jay |editor3=Edward Dimendberg |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4A1gt4-VCsC&pg=PA8 |chapter=The Treaty of Versailles: The Reparations Clauses |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |page=8 |isbn=978-0520909601}}</ref> It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary.
