Blue infrastructure is commonly associated with green infrastructure in the urban setting and may be referred to as \"blue-green\" infrastructure when in combination. Rivers, streams, ponds and lakes may exist as natural features within cities, or be added to an urban environment as an aspect of its design. Urban developments on coasts may also have pre-existing features of the coastline specifically employed in their design. Harbours, quays, piers and other extensions of the urban environment may also be added to capture benefits associated with the marine environment.

The flooding was a result of funneled runoff directed into storm drains by impervious cove, which ran unmitigated and unabsorbed into their farmlands downstream. The farmers were awarded an undisclosed amount of money in the tens of millions as compensation. Low density and highly paved residential communities redirect stormwater from impervious surfaces and pipes to stream at velocities much greater than predevelopment rates. Not only are these practices environmentally damaging, they can be costly and inefficient to maintain. In response, the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] opted to employ a green infrastructure strategy and chose a 250-hectare site called East Clayton as a demonstration project. The approach reduced the stormwater flowing downstream and allows for infiltration of rainwater closer if not at its point of origin. In result, the stormwater system at East Clayton had the ability to hold one inch of rainfall per day, accounting for 90% of the annual rainfall. The incorporation of green infrastructure at Surrey, British Columbia was able to create a sustainable environment that diminishes runoff and to save around $12,000 per household.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Nya Kroksl\u00e4tt, Sweden===\n\nThe site of former factory [[Nya Kroksl\u00e4tt]] is situated between a mountain and a stream.

These efforts sparked a successful economic rebound. The city did not stop there, and decided in the 2000s to harness the redevelopment progress for even better environmental outcomes, in particular that related to stormwater runoff, by requiring in 2005 the use of on-site GI practices in all new private development projects. The city faced several challenges, including a high water table, tidal flows, clay soils, contaminated soil and water, and few absorbent natural areas among the primarily impervious, paved parcels of existing and redeveloped industrial sites. The guidelines, and an accompanying spreadsheet model, were developed to make as much use of redevelopment sites as possible for handling stormwater. The main strategies fell into several categories:\n* Reducing the need, space and stormwater impact of motor vehicle parking by way of increased densities, height limits and floor area ratios; shared, stacked, indoor and unbundled automobile parking; making the best use of on-street parking and pricing strategies; car-sharing; free citywide mass transit; requiring one secure indoor bicycle parking space per bedroom and better bicycle and pedestrian roadway infrastructure.\n* Sustainable landscape design features, such as tree preservation and minimum rootable soil volumes for new tree planting, use of structural soils, suspended paving systems, bioretention and biofiltration strategies and requiring the use of the holistic practices of Bay-Friendly Landscaping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bayfriendlycoalition.org|title=ReScape - Rethinking California Landscapes}}</ref>\n* Water storage and harvesting through cisterns and rooftop containers.\n* Other strategies to handle or infiltrate water on development and redevelopment sites.\n\n===Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, New York, US===\nThe [[Gowanus Canal]], in [[Brooklyn, New York]], is bounded by several communities including Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Red Hook. The canal empties into [[New York Harbor]]. Completed in 1869, the canal was once a major transportation route for the then separate cities of Brooklyn and New York City. Manufactured gas plants, mills, tanneries, and chemical plants are among the many facilities that operated along the canal. As a result of years of discharges, storm water runoff, sewer outflows, and industrial pollutants, the canal has become one of the nation's most extensively contaminated water bodies. Contaminants include PCBs, coal tar wastes, heavy metals, and volatile organics. On March 2, 2010, EPA added the canal to its Superfund [[National Priorities List]] (NPL). Placing the canal on the list allows the agency to further investigate contamination at the site and develop an approach to address the contamination.\n\nAfter the NPL designation, several firms tried to redesign the area surrounding the canal to meet EPA's principles. One of the proposals was the Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, suggested by DLANDstudio, an architecture and landscape architecture firm based in Brooklyn. The firm designed a public open space system that slows, absorbs, and filters surface water runoff with the goal of remediating contaminated water, activating the private canal waterfront, and revitalizing the neighborhood. The unique feature of the park is its character as a working landscape that means the ability to improve the environment of the canal over time while simultaneously supporting public engagement with the canal ecosystem. The park was cited in a professional award by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], in the Analysis and Planning category, in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Lafitte Greenway, New Orleans, Louisiana, US ===\nThe [[Lafitte Greenway]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], is a post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] revitalization effort that utilizes green infrastructure to improve water quality as well as support wildlife habitat.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/2013awards/328.html|title=2013 ASLA Professional Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=ASLA.com|access-date=}}</ref> The site was previously an industrial corridor that connected the [[French Quarter]] to [[Bayou St. John, New Orleans|Bayou St. John]] and [[Lake Pontchartrain]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Part of the revitalization plan was to incorporate green infrastructure for environmental sustainability.<ref name=\":0\" /> One strategy to mitigate localized flooding was to create recreation fields that are carved out to hold water during times of heavy rains.<ref name=\":0\" />  Another strategy was to restore the native ecology of the corridor, giving special attention to the ecotones that bisect the site.<ref name=\":0\" /> The design proposed retrofitting historic buildings with stormwater management techniques, such as rainwater collection systems, which allows historic buildings to be preserved.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project received the Award of Excellence from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Geographic information system applications==\nA [[geographic information system]] (GIS) is a computer system for that allows users to capture, store, display, and analyze all kinds of spatial data on Earth.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.com\">{{cite web|title=GIS (geographic information system)|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/?ar_a=1|website=National Geographic|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> GIS can gather multiple layers of information on one single map regarding streets, buildings, soil types, vegetation, and more.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.com\"/> Planners can combine or calculate useful information such as impervious area percentage or vegetation coverage status of a specific region to design or analyze the use of green infrastructure.

One advantage that green infrastructure projects offer, however, is that they generate so many benefits that they can compete for a variety of diverse funding sources. Some tax incentive programs administered by federal agencies can be used to attract financing to green infrastructure projects. Here are two examples of programs whose missions are broad enough to support green infrastructure projects:\n\n* The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] administers a range of energy efficiency tax incentives, and green infrastructure could be integrated into project design to claim the incentive. An example of how this might work is found in Oregon's Energy Efficiency Construction Credits. In Eugene, Oregon, a new biofuel station built on an abandoned gas station site included a green roof, bioswales and rain gardens. In this case, nearly $250,000 worth of tax credits reduced income and sales tax for the private company that built and operated the project.\n* The [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] administers the multibillion-dollar [[New Markets Tax Credit Program]], which encourages private investment for a range of project types (typically real estate or business development projects) in distressed areas. Awards are allocated to non-profit and private entities based on their proposals for distributing these tax benefits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/funding-opportunities |title=Funding Opportunities |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015-11-02 |website=Green Infrastructure |publisher=EPA}}</ref>\n\n===Benefits===\n[[File:Emeryville California Stormwater Curb Extension.jpg|thumbnail|right|This Stormwater Curb Extension in Emeryville, California provides a pedestrian safety element as well as stormwater quality benefits.

For example:\n* Urban forestry in an urban environment can supplement managing storm water and reduce the energy usage costs and runoff in result. \n* Bio-retention systems can work to create a green transportation system.\n* Stormwater Curb Extensions can increase pedestrian safety by increasing visibility and reducing crossing distances at intersections.\nIn result, high performing green spaces work to create a balance between built and natural environments.\n\n===Economic effects===\nA study in 2012 that focused on 479 green infrastructure projects across the United States, found that 44% of green infrastructure projects reduce costs compared to the 31% that increased the costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/uploadedFiles/CMS/Government_Affairs/Federal_Government_Affairs/Banking%20on%20Green%20HighRes.pdf|title=Banking On Green: Look at How Green Infrastructure Can Save Municipalities Money and Provide Economic Benefits Community-wide|last=|first=|date=April 2012|website=American Society of Landscape Architects|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref> The most notable cost savings were due to reduced stormwater runoff and decreased heating and cooling costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/ContentDetail.aspx?id=31301|title=Banking on Green {{!}} asla.org|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nA comprehensive green infrastructure in Philadelphia is planned to cost just $1.2 billion over the next 25 years, compared to over $6 billion for \"grey\" infrastructure (concrete tunnels created to move water).

Also, the green stormwater management systems alone will save $1 billion, at a cost of about $0.15 less per gallon. The sustainability benefits in New York City range from $139\u2013418 million over the 20 year life of the project.

The flooding was a result of funneled runoff directed into storm drains by impervious cove, which ran unmitigated and unabsorbed into their farmlands downstream. The farmers were awarded an undisclosed amount of money in the tens of millions as compensation. Low density and highly paved residential communities redirect stormwater from impervious surfaces and pipes to stream at velocities much greater than predevelopment rates. Not only are these practices environmentally damaging, they can be costly and inefficient to maintain. In response, the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] opted to employ a green infrastructure strategy and chose a 250-hectare site called East Clayton as a demonstration project. The approach reduced the stormwater flowing downstream and allows for infiltration of rainwater closer if not at its point of origin. In result, the stormwater system at East Clayton had the ability to hold one inch of rainfall per day, accounting for 90% of the annual rainfall. The incorporation of green infrastructure at Surrey, British Columbia was able to create a sustainable environment that diminishes runoff and to save around $12,000 per household.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Nya Kroksl\u00e4tt, Sweden===\n\nThe site of former factory [[Nya Kroksl\u00e4tt]] is situated between a mountain and a stream.

These efforts sparked a successful economic rebound. The city did not stop there, and decided in the 2000s to harness the redevelopment progress for even better environmental outcomes, in particular that related to stormwater runoff, by requiring in 2005 the use of on-site GI practices in all new private development projects. The city faced several challenges, including a high water table, tidal flows, clay soils, contaminated soil and water, and few absorbent natural areas among the primarily impervious, paved parcels of existing and redeveloped industrial sites. The guidelines, and an accompanying spreadsheet model, were developed to make as much use of redevelopment sites as possible for handling stormwater. The main strategies fell into several categories:\n* Reducing the need, space and stormwater impact of motor vehicle parking by way of increased densities, height limits and floor area ratios; shared, stacked, indoor and unbundled automobile parking; making the best use of on-street parking and pricing strategies; car-sharing; free citywide mass transit; requiring one secure indoor bicycle parking space per bedroom and better bicycle and pedestrian roadway infrastructure.\n* Sustainable landscape design features, such as tree preservation and minimum rootable soil volumes for new tree planting, use of structural soils, suspended paving systems, bioretention and biofiltration strategies and requiring the use of the holistic practices of Bay-Friendly Landscaping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bayfriendlycoalition.org|title=ReScape - Rethinking California Landscapes}}</ref>\n* Water storage and harvesting through cisterns and rooftop containers.\n* Other strategies to handle or infiltrate water on development and redevelopment sites.\n\n===Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, New York, US===\nThe [[Gowanus Canal]], in [[Brooklyn, New York]], is bounded by several communities including Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Red Hook. The canal empties into [[New York Harbor]]. Completed in 1869, the canal was once a major transportation route for the then separate cities of Brooklyn and New York City. Manufactured gas plants, mills, tanneries, and chemical plants are among the many facilities that operated along the canal. As a result of years of discharges, storm water runoff, sewer outflows, and industrial pollutants, the canal has become one of the nation's most extensively contaminated water bodies. Contaminants include PCBs, coal tar wastes, heavy metals, and volatile organics. On March 2, 2010, EPA added the canal to its Superfund [[National Priorities List]] (NPL). Placing the canal on the list allows the agency to further investigate contamination at the site and develop an approach to address the contamination.\n\nAfter the NPL designation, several firms tried to redesign the area surrounding the canal to meet EPA's principles. One of the proposals was the Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, suggested by DLANDstudio, an architecture and landscape architecture firm based in Brooklyn. The firm designed a public open space system that slows, absorbs, and filters surface water runoff with the goal of remediating contaminated water, activating the private canal waterfront, and revitalizing the neighborhood. The unique feature of the park is its character as a working landscape that means the ability to improve the environment of the canal over time while simultaneously supporting public engagement with the canal ecosystem. The park was cited in a professional award by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], in the Analysis and Planning category, in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Lafitte Greenway, New Orleans, Louisiana, US ===\nThe [[Lafitte Greenway]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], is a post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] revitalization effort that utilizes green infrastructure to improve water quality as well as support wildlife habitat.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/2013awards/328.html|title=2013 ASLA Professional Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=ASLA.com|access-date=}}</ref> The site was previously an industrial corridor that connected the [[French Quarter]] to [[Bayou St. John, New Orleans|Bayou St. John]] and [[Lake Pontchartrain]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Part of the revitalization plan was to incorporate green infrastructure for environmental sustainability.<ref name=\":0\" /> One strategy to mitigate localized flooding was to create recreation fields that are carved out to hold water during times of heavy rains.<ref name=\":0\" />  Another strategy was to restore the native ecology of the corridor, giving special attention to the ecotones that bisect the site.<ref name=\":0\" /> The design proposed retrofitting historic buildings with stormwater management techniques, such as rainwater collection systems, which allows historic buildings to be preserved.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project received the Award of Excellence from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Geographic information system applications==\nA [[geographic information system]] (GIS) is a computer system for that allows users to capture, store, display, and analyze all kinds of spatial data on Earth.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.com\">{{cite web|title=GIS (geographic information system)|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/?ar_a=1|website=National Geographic|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> GIS can gather multiple layers of information on one single map regarding streets, buildings, soil types, vegetation, and more.<ref name=\"education.nationalgeographic.com\"/> Planners can combine or calculate useful information such as impervious area percentage or vegetation coverage status of a specific region to design or analyze the use of green infrastructure.

One advantage that green infrastructure projects offer, however, is that they generate so many benefits that they can compete for a variety of diverse funding sources. Some tax incentive programs administered by federal agencies can be used to attract financing to green infrastructure projects. Here are two examples of programs whose missions are broad enough to support green infrastructure projects:\n\n* The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] administers a range of energy efficiency tax incentives, and green infrastructure could be integrated into project design to claim the incentive. An example of how this might work is found in Oregon's Energy Efficiency Construction Credits. In Eugene, Oregon, a new biofuel station built on an abandoned gas station site included a green roof, bioswales and rain gardens. In this case, nearly $250,000 worth of tax credits reduced income and sales tax for the private company that built and operated the project.\n* The [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] administers the multibillion-dollar [[New Markets Tax Credit Program]], which encourages private investment for a range of project types (typically real estate or business development projects) in distressed areas. Awards are allocated to non-profit and private entities based on their proposals for distributing these tax benefits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/funding-opportunities |title=Funding Opportunities |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015-11-02 |website=Green Infrastructure |publisher=EPA}}</ref>\n\n===Benefits===\n[[File:Emeryville California Stormwater Curb Extension.jpg|thumbnail|right|This Stormwater Curb Extension in Emeryville, California provides a pedestrian safety element as well as stormwater quality benefits. It uses Bay-Friendly Landscaping and recycled water for irrigation.]]\nSome people might expect that green spaces are excessive to maintain and extravagant in nature, but high-performing green spaces can provide real economic, ecological and social benefits. For example:\n* Urban forestry in an urban environment can supplement managing storm water and reduce the energy usage costs and runoff in result. \n* Bio-retention systems can work to create a green transportation system.\n* Stormwater Curb Extensions can increase pedestrian safety by increasing visibility and reducing crossing distances at intersections.\nIn result, high performing green spaces work to create a balance between built and natural environments.\n\n===Economic effects===\nA study in 2012 that focused on 479 green infrastructure projects across the United States, found that 44% of green infrastructure projects reduce costs compared to the 31% that increased the costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/uploadedFiles/CMS/Government_Affairs/Federal_Government_Affairs/Banking%20on%20Green%20HighRes.pdf|title=Banking On Green: Look at How Green Infrastructure Can Save Municipalities Money and Provide Economic Benefits Community-wide|last=|first=|date=April 2012|website=American Society of Landscape Architects|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref> The most notable cost savings were due to reduced stormwater runoff and decreased heating and cooling costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/ContentDetail.aspx?id=31301|title=Banking on Green {{!}} asla.org|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nA comprehensive green infrastructure in Philadelphia is planned to cost just $1.2 billion over the next 25 years, compared to over $6 billion for \"grey\" infrastructure (concrete tunnels created to move water). Under the new green infrastructure plan it is expected that:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phila.gov/water/sustainability/greencitycleanwaters/Pages/default.aspx|title=City of Philadelphia: Green City, Clean Waters|website=www.phila.gov|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n*250 people will be employed annually in green jobs.\n*Up to 1.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emission to be avoided or absorbed through green infrastructure each year (the equivalent of removing close to 3,400 vehicles from roadways) \n*Air quality will improve due to all the new trees, green roofs, and parks\n*Communities will benefit on the social and health side \n*About 20 deaths due to asthma will be avoided\n*250 fewer work or school days will be missed\n*Deaths due to excessive urban heat could also be cut by 250 over 20 years.\n*The new greenery will increase property values by $390 million over 45 years, also boosting the property taxes the city takes in.\n\nA green infrastructure plan in New York City is expected to cost $1.5 billion less than a comparable grey infrastructure approach. Also, the green stormwater management systems alone will save $1 billion, at a cost of about $0.15 less per gallon. The sustainability benefits in New York City range from $139\u2013418 million over the 20 year life of the project. This green plan estimates that \u201cevery fully vegetated acre of green infrastructure would provide total annual benefits of $8.522 in reduced energy demand, $166 in reduced CO2 emissions, $1,044 in improved air quality, and $4,725 in increased property value.\u201d<ref name=\"citylab.com\"/><ref name=\"EPA-econ\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asla.org/ContentDetail.aspx?id=43535 |title=Green Infrastructure: Cities |publisher=American Society of Landscape Architects}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/green-infrastructure-cost-benefit-resources |title=Green Infrastructure Cost-Benefit Resources |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2016-08-12 |publisher=EPA}}</ref>\n\n===Initiatives===\nOne program that has integrated green infrastructure into construction projects worldwide is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification.
