Lee]] at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  The monument is sited on the 300 block of [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW in front of the [[E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse]].  It was originally located at [[Union Square (Washington, D.C.)|Union Square]], but was removed and placed in storage for fourteen years before being installed at its current location.  The statue was sculpted by [[Charles Grafly]], an educator and founder of the [[National Sculpture Society]], and was a gift from the state of Pennsylvania.  Prominent attendees at the dedication ceremony in 1927 included President [[Calvin Coolidge]], Governor [[John Stuchell Fisher]], Secretary of the Treasury [[Andrew W. Mellon]], and Senator [[Simeon D. Fess]].\n\nThe memorial is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|eighteen Civil War monuments]] in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The marble and granite sculpture, which includes depictions of Meade and seven allegorical figures, rests on a granite base and granite platform.  It is surrounded by a public plaza and small park.  The monument is owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[George Meade]] (1815\u20131872) was a career military officer from [[Pennsylvania]] who is best known for his role as a [[Union Army|Union]] general during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1835 and briefly served in the Army during the [[Second Seminole War]]. He began working as a [[civil engineer]] for railroad companies and the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] until reenlisting in the army in 1842.  Meade fought in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and was promoted to first lieutenant for his heroic actions at the [[Battle of Monterrey]].  From the 1850s until the onset of the Civil War in 1861, Meade was involved in coastal surveying and designing lighthouses, mainly for the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. He was promoted to brigadier general at the beginning of war, but was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Glendale]] in 1862.  He recovered and led forces during major battles, including [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]]. In June 1863, Meade replaced General [[Joseph Hooker]] as commanding officer of the [[Army of the Potomac]], and fought his greatest battle only days later at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], the bloodiest battle of the war. He succeeding in defeating General [[Robert E. Lee]] and the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces, but was criticized by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] for allowing Confederate forces to retreat to [[Virginia]]. Meade continued to serve as the Army of the Potomac's commanding officer until the end of the war, though [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed general-in-chief of all Union armies, superseding Meade's authority.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/george-g-meade | title=George G.

In the 1910s, members of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) and [[Society of the Army of the Potomac]] fraternal organizations lobbied the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] to fund a statue of Meade.<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=Baltimore | pages=54\u201359 | isbn=9780801858611 }}</ref>  The state assembly commissioned the sculpture on October 18, 1913, and appropriated $200,000 for its construction.  Members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation lobbied Congress to approve the sculpture and an act of Congress authorized its erection on January 21, 1915.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=smithsonian/>  Congress mandated that the sculpture design and site of the memorial be approved by the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts|Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA).  Because the memorial was a gift from the state of Pennsylvania, a Meade Memorial Commission was appointed by the state governor.  The commission, led by John W. Frazier, a veteran who fought with Meade at Gettysburg, was composed of architects, artists, and planners who agreed on very little.  Frazier was considered abusive and tactless, sending rude letters to the CFA and demanding certain requirements for the memorial.  This created an impasse which lasted until Frazier's death in 1918.  Following his death, the memorial commission finally chose a sculptor, a Pennsylvania native named [[Charles Grafly]] (1862\u20131929).<ref name=jacob/>\n\nGrafly was a founder of the [[National Sculpture Society]] and longtime educator at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] who was best known for his portrait busts.  Although Grafly was at the peak of his career, the CGA was hesitant in approving him to design the sculpture because his symbolic works had been criticized for being incomprehensible.  The CFA finally agreed to consider Grafly and following several months of negotiations and changes, a preliminary sculpture design was approved in August 1918.<ref name=jacob/>  Grafly received $85,000 for his commission.<ref name=smithsonian/>  Several years of bickering about the final design and location of the memorial passed until March 28, 1922, when an official groundbreaking ceremony took place.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=smithsonian/>  The chosen site was near 3rd Street NW in [[Union Square (Washington, D.C.)|Union Square]], a public park on [[Capitol Hill]], and close to the large [[Ulysses S.

Before the memorial was installed, the last of the old [[United States Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] greenhouses were demolished and the [[Bartholdi Fountain]] was moved to make way.<ref name=jacob/>  The architects chosen to design the memorial were Grant Simon and Edward P.

By the time of the dedication, many of the GAR and Society of the Army of the Potomac members who championed the memorial had died and only a few Civil War veterans were able to attend the ceremony.<ref name=jacob/>  Prominent attendees at the ceremony included President [[Calvin Coolidge]], his wife, [[Grace Coolidge|Grace]], Pennsylvania Governor [[John Stuchell Fisher]], Secretary of the Navy [[Curtis D.

White, temporary pavilions adorned with greenery, national shields, and the [[Flag and coat of arms of Pennsylvania|coat of arms of Pennsylvania]] were built around the memorial for invited guests and members of the public.  The speaker's stand was decorated with palms, ferns, and autumn-colored flowers.  On either side of the memorial was the [[Flag of the United States|national flag]]; the left flag from the Civil War era had 35 stars and the right flag was the current 48-starred flag.<ref name=dedication/>\n\nNorthminster Presbyterian Church minister Hugh K. Fulton gave the invocation and Reverend J. H. Pershing led the dedicatory prayer.  A speech detailing Meade's life and career was given by Fisher which was followed by the unveiling of the memorial by Meade's daughter, Henrietta, who was escorted by [[Ulysses S. Grant III]].  As the memorial was unveiled, a flock of pigeons, symbolizing peace, was released from an altar bearing the Army of the Potomac's emblem.  The [[United States Army Band|Army Band]] played \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" as Army cannons were fired.  Fisher presented the memorial on behalf of the state of Pennsylvania to Coolidge on behalf of the American people.  Coolidge's remarks including the following: \"On behalf of the Government of the Nation which he helped to save, I accept this memorial erected by the Commonwealth which has his own home and the home of his ancestors.  The conflict in which he took such an important part has long since passed away.  The peace which he loved has come.  The reconciliation which he sought is complete.  The loyalty to the flag which he followed is universal.  Through all of this shines his own immortal flame.\"  An elderly veteran who fought at Gettysburg collapsed as he was giving a speech recounting his experience during the battle.  [[Blanton Winship]], at the time the president's chief military aid, and James F. Coupal, the president's physician, came to his aid.  He was able to finish his speech and the crowds cheered him.  The ceremony concluded with the band playing \"[[Taps]]\".<ref name=dedication/>\n\n===Later history===\nIn 1969, the memorial was dismantled and placed in a storage facility at 42nd Street and Hunt Place NE when the [[Capitol Reflecting Pool]] was built atop [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia\u2013Virginia)|Interstate 395]]'s Third Street Tunnel.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=nomination>{{cite web | url={{NRHP url|id=78000257}} | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory\u2014Nomination Form \u2013 Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=National Park Service | date=September 19, 1977 | accessdate=February 20, 2015 | author=Scott, Gary }}</ref>  It remained in storage for several years and members of the public began inquiring why the memorial had not been replaced.
