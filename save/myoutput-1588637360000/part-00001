''Final Fantasy VI'', being the sixth game in the series proper, was the first to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]; the role was filled instead by [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Hiroyuki Ito]]. [[Yoshitaka Amano]], long-time collaborator to the ''Final Fantasy'' series, returned as the character designer and contributed widely to visual concept design, while series-regular, composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], wrote the [[music of Final Fantasy VI|game's score]], which has been released on several [[soundtrack album]]s. Set in a fantasy world with technology resembling that of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], the game's story follows an expanding cast that includes fourteen permanent [[player character|playable characters]]. The drama includes and extends past depicting a rebellion against an evil military dictatorship, pursuit of a magical arms-race, use of chemical weapons in warfare, depiction of violent, apocalyptic confrontations with divinities, several personal redemption arcs, teenage pregnancy, and the continuous renewal of hope and life itself.\n\n''Final Fantasy VI'' was released to critical acclaim and is seen as a landmark title for the role-playing genre; for instance, it was ranked as the 2nd best RPG of all time by [[IGN]] in 2017. Its SNES and PlayStation versions have sold over 3.48 million copies worldwide to date as a stand-alone game, as well as over 750,000 copies as part of the Japanese ''[[Final Fantasy Collection]]'' and the North American ''Final Fantasy Anthology''. ''Final Fantasy VI'' has won numerous awards and is considered by many to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]].\n\nIt was ported by [[Tose (company)|Tose]] with minor differences to [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999 and Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2006, and it was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2011. In 2017, [[Nintendo]] re-released ''Final Fantasy VI'' as part of the company's [[Super NES Classic Edition]].<ref name=\"Super NES Classic Edition\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic|title=Super NES Classic Edition|publisher=[[Nintendo of America, Inc.]]|date=September 29, 2017}}</ref> The game was known as ''Final Fantasy III'' when it was first released in North America, as the original ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' had not been released outside Japan at the time (leaving [[Final Fantasy IV|IV]] as the second title released outside Japan and VI as the third). However, most later localizations use the original title.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike previous ''Final Fantasy'' installments, ''Final Fantasy VI'' consists of four basic modes of [[gameplay]]: an [[overworld]] map, town and [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon]] field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's [[fictional universe|fictional world]], which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, [[chocobo]], and [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Airships and transport|airship]]. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are [[random encounter|randomly encountered]] on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track [[experience point|experience points and levels]].<ref name=\"basicinfo\">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | page=39 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>\n\nThe game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful information and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate [[quest (video gaming)|side-quests]]. Dungeons appear as a variety of areas, including caves, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Dungeons may feature puzzles and mazes, with some dungeons requiring the player to divide the characters into multiple parties which must work together to advance through the dungeon.<ref name=\"basicinfo\"/>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:Final Fantasy VI battle.png|thumb|left|A battle in ''Final Fantasy VI''|alt=A battle scene, with four of the heroes on the right and two larger four-footed monsters on the left. The figures are displayed on a green field with mountains in the background, and the names and status of the figures is displayed in blue boxes in the bottom third of the screen.]]\n\nCombat in ''Final Fantasy VI'' is [[menu (computing)|menu]]-based, in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four characters may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional [[Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistic]]. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' ''Runic'' ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.<ref name=\"FF6battle\">{{cite web|url= http://na.square-enix.com/games/anthology/FFVI/battle.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309000344/http://na.square-enix.com/games/anthology/FFVI/battle.html|archivedate=2008-03-09 |title=Final Fantasy VI\u2014Battle Systems | year=2002 | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref>\n\nAnother element is the Desperation Attack, [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy|a powerful attack substitution]] that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later ''Final Fantasy'' titles under a variety of different names, including Limit Breaks, Trances, and Overdrives.<ref name=\"ff7ign\">{{cite web | url = http://au.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii | title = IGN Presents: The History of Final Fantasy VII | website = IGN | date = 2008-04-30 | accessdate = 2009-04-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128130134/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii|archivedate=2014-01-28}}</ref> Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with [[experience point]]s and money, called [[Gil (Final Fantasy)|gil]] ([[Gold coin|Gold Piece]] (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.<ref name=\"FF6battle\"/>\n\n===Customization===\nCharacters in ''Final Fantasy VI'' can be equipped with a variety of weapons, armor and, particular to this entry, powerful accessories known as \"Relics\". Weapons and armor increase combat capability mostly by increasing statistics and adding beneficial effects to attacks. By comparison, Relics have a variety of uses and effects, are almost entirely interchangeable among party members, and are extended in sophistication to alter basic battle commands and exceed normal limitations of the game's systems.\n\nAlthough in ''Final Fantasy VI'' only two playable characters start the game with the ability to use magic, magic may later be taught to almost all other playable characters through the game's introduction of magicite and the Espers that magicite shards contain. \"Espers\" are the game's incarnation of the series' trope of \"summons\", powerful monstrous beings, many of which are recurring throughout the series, such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin. Besides those returning from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VI'' features approximately two dozen of them in total, with more added to later versions of the game.\n\nThe setting and plot of the game revolve heavily around Espers and their remains when deceased, which are referred to as \"magicite\". Each piece of magicite has a specific set of magic spells that a character can learn when they are equipped with it in the menu. Additionally, some pieces of magicite grant a statistical bonus to a character when they gain a level. Finally, when a character equips a piece of magicite, they may summon the corresponding Esper during battle.<ref name=\"basicinfo3\">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | page=47 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- This section has been edited to comply with the featured article criteria.

The structure of society is similar to that of the latter half of the 19th century, with [[opera]] and the [[fine art]]s serving as recurring motifs throughout the game,<ref name=\"NPC in Jidor\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(NPC in Jidoor)''' You like art? No? Philistines!}}</ref> and a level of technology comparable to that of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. During the first half of the game, the planet is referred to as the World of Balance, and is divided into three lush continents. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges, the southern continent has been mostly subjugated by the cruel Gestahl Empire, and the eastern continent is home to the Veldt, a massive wilderness inhabited by monsters from all over the world. An apocalyptic event mid-game transforms the planet into the World of Ruin; its withering landmasses are fractured into numerous islands surrounding a larger continent.\n\nThe game alludes to a conflict known as the \"War of the Magi,\" which occurred one thousand years prior to the beginning of the game. In this conflict, three quarreling entities known as the \"Warring Triad\" used innocent humans as soldiers by transforming them into enslaved magical beings called Espers. The Triad realized their wrongdoings; they freed the espers and sealed their own powers inside three stone statues.<ref name=\"Statues\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES|quote='''Left statue:''' The birth of magic... three goddesses were banished here. In time they began quarreling, which led to all-out war. Those unlucky humans who got in the way were transformed to Espers, and used as living war machines. / '''Right Statue:''' The goddesses finally realized that they were being laughed at by those who had banished them here. In a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to seal themselves away from the world. With their last ounce of energy they gave the Espers back their own free will, and then transformed themselves... ...into stone. Their only request was that the Espers keep them sealed away from all eternity. / '''Center Statue:''' The Espers created these statues as a symbol of their vow to let the goddesses sleep in peace. The Espers have sworn to keep the goddesses' power from being abused.}}</ref> As a precaution, the espers sealed off both the statues and themselves from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology.<ref name=\"Game opening\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(Game opening)''' Long ago, the War of the Magi reduced the world to a scorched wasteland, and magic simply ceased to exist. 1000 years have passed... Iron, gunpowder and steam engines have been rediscovered, and high technology reigns...}}</ref> At the game's opening, the Empire has taken advantage of the weakening barrier between the human and esper domains, capturing several espers in the process. Using these espers as a power source, the Empire has created \"Magitek\", a craft that combines magic with machinery (including [[mecha|mechanical infantry]]) and infuses humans with magical powers.<ref name=\"Magitek Armor\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(Soldier)''' Open up! Give us back the girl and the Empire's Magitek Armor!}}</ref> The Empire is opposed by the Returners, a rebel organization seeking to free the subjugated lands.\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|Characters of Final Fantasy VI}}\n\n''Final Fantasy VI'' features fourteen permanent [[player character|playable characters]], the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, [[Terra Branford]], is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love.<ref name=\"Slave Crown\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''Wedge:''' Not to worry.

The clownish Kefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights, rendering him insane; his actions throughout the game reflect his demented nature.<ref name=\"NPC in Vector\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(NPC in Vector)''' That guy Kefka?

Upon locating it, a magical reaction occurs between Terra and the Esper; as a result, the soldiers accompanying Terra are killed and Terra is knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, Terra is informed that the Empire had been using a device called a \"slave crown\" to control her actions. With the crown now removed, Terra cannot remember anything more than her name and her rare ability to use magic unaided.<ref>'''Terra:''' You... saved me? / '''Locke:''' Save your thanks for the Moogles! / '''Terra:''' Uhh...

The most obvious of these is the change of the game's title from ''Final Fantasy VI'' to ''Final Fantasy III''; because only two games of the series had been localized in North America at the time, ''Final Fantasy VI'' was distributed as ''Final Fantasy III'' to maintain naming continuity. Unlike ''Final Fantasy IV'' (which was first released in North America as ''Final Fantasy II''), there are no major changes to gameplay,<ref name=\"EGM63\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Final Fantasy III|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=63|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1994|page=172}}</ref> though several changes of contents and editorial adjustments exist in the English script. In a January 1995 interview with ''[[Super Play]]'' magazine, translator [[Ted Woolsey]] explained that \"there's a certain level of playfulness and ... sexuality in Japanese games that just doesn't exist here [in the USA], basically because of [[Nintendo of America]]'s rules and guidelines\".<ref name=\"SPWoolseyint\">{{cite journal |date=September 1994 |title=Fantasy Quest: Interview with Ted Woolsey |journal=[[Super Play]] |volume=1 |issue=23 |page= |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |issn=0966-6192 }}</ref> Consequently, objectionable graphics (e.g. nudity) were censored and building signs in towns were changed (such as Bar being changed to Caf\u00e9), as well as religious allusions (e.g. the spell ''Holy'' was renamed ''Pearl'').<ref name=\"RPGFF6retroreview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6/reviews/ff6strev3.html |title=Final Fantasy VI \u2013 Staff Re-Retroview |last=Beckett |first=Michael |publisher=RPGamer |accessdate=2009-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913140835/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6/reviews/ff6strev3.html |archivedate=2010-09-13 }}</ref>\n\nAlso, some direct allusions to death, killing actions, and violent expressions, as well as offensive words have been replaced by softer expressions. For example, after Edgar, Locke and Terra flee on chocobos from Figaro Castle, Kefka orders two Magitek Armored soldiers to chase them by shouting \"Go! KILL THEM!\", in the Japanese version. It was translated as \"Go! Get them!\" Also, when Imperial Troopers burn Figaro Castle, and Edgar claims Terra is not hidden inside the castle, Kefka replies \"then you can burn to death\" in the Japanese version, which was replaced in the English version by \"Then welcome to my barbecue!\". Similarly, as Magitek soldiers watch Edgar and his guests escape on Chocobos, Kefka swears in Japanese, which was translated by Ted Woolsey as \"Son of a submariner!\".<ref name=\"RPGFF6retroreview\"/> The localization also featured changes to several names, such as \"Tina\" being changed to \"Terra\". Finally, dialogue text files had to be shortened due to the limited data storage space available on the game cartridge's [[read-only memory]].<ref name=\"SPWoolseyint\"/> As a result, additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space.<ref name=\"SPWoolseyint\"/>\n\nThe PlayStation re-release featured only minor changes to the English localization. The title of the game was reverted to ''Final Fantasy VI'' from ''Final Fantasy III'', to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. A few item and character names were adjusted, as in the expansion of \"Fenix Down\" to \"Phoenix Down\". Unlike the PlayStation re-release of ''Final Fantasy IV'' included in the later ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' compilation, the script was left essentially unchanged.<ref name=\"RPGFFFAreview\" /> The Game Boy Advance re-release featured a new translation by a different translator, Tom Slattery.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |title=Final Fantasy VI advance info |website=[[GameFAQs]] |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/gba/930370-final-fantasy-vi-advance/data |accessdate=2007-05-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513220851/http://www.gamefaqs.com/gba/930370-final-fantasy-vi-advance/data |archivedate=2010-05-13 }}</ref> This translation preserved most of the character names, location names, and terminology from the Woolsey translation, but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series.<ref name=\"IGNFF6Areview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/15/final-fantasy-vi-advance-review |title=IGN: Final Fantasy VI Advance Review |accessdate=2009-01-12 |website=IGN |author=Dunham, Jeremy |date=2007-02-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104043613/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/15/final-fantasy-vi-advance-review |archivedate=2012-11-04 }}</ref> The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others, and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the original translation.<ref name=\"Schreier2007\">{{cite web |author=Schreier, Jason |year=2007 |title=Final Fantasy VI Advance Staff Review |publisher=RPGamer |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6gba/reviews/ff6gbastrev2.html |accessdate=2007-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203128/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6gba/reviews/ff6gbastrev2.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> The [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] release used the ''Final Fantasy III'' name of the SNES game.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Final Fantasy VI}}\n\nThe soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy VI'' was composed by long-time series contributor [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The score consists of themes for each major character and location, as well as music for standard battles, fights with [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] enemies and for special cutscenes. The extensive use of [[leitmotif]] is one of the defining points of the audio tracks. The \"[[Aria di Mezzo Carattere]]\" is one of the latter tracks, played during a cutscene involving an [[opera]] performance. This track features an unintelligible synthesized \"voice\" that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the [[Nintendo S-SMP|SPC700]] [[Timeline of audio formats|sound format]] chip prevented the use of an actual [[vocal music|vocal track]] (although some developers eventually figured out how to overcome the limitation a few years later). The orchestral album ''[[Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale]]'' features an arranged version of the [[aria]], using Italian [[lyrics]] performed by Svetla Krasteva with an orchestral accompaniment. This version is also found in the ending [[full motion video]] of the game's [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] re-release, with the same lyrics but a different musical [[arrangement]]. In addition, the [[album]] ''[[Orchestral Game Music Concert|Orchestral Game Concert 4]]'' includes an extended version of the opera arranged and conducted by K\u014dsuke Onozaki and performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, featuring Wakako Aokimi, Tetsuya \u014cno, and Hiroshi Kuroda on vocals.<ref name=\"extaria\">{{cite web|author=Farand, Eric |title=Original Game Concert 4 |url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ogc4/index.html |publisher=RPGFan |accessdate=2006-08-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913161006/http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ogc4/index.html |archivedate=2006-09-13 }}</ref> It was also performed at the \"More Friends\" concert<ref name=\"daetrin\">{{cite web| title=Uematsu's Music\u2014More Friends | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/uematsu/concert/more_friends.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409141558/http://www.square-enix-usa.com/uematsu/concert/more_friends.html | archivedate=2008-04-09 | publisher=Square Enix USA | accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in 2005 using a new English translation of the lyrics, an album of which is now available.<ref name=\"daetrin2\">{{cite web|author=Gann, Patrick |title=More Friends music from Final Fantasy ~Los Angeles Live 2005~ |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ffmorela/index.html |publisher=RPGFan |accessdate=2007-06-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611174032/http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ffmorela/index.html |archivedate=2007-06-11 }}</ref> \"[[Dancing Mad (Final Fantasy VI)|Dancing Mad]]\", accompanying the game's final battle with Kefka, is 17 minutes long and contains an [[organ (music)|organ]] [[cadenza]], with variations on Kefka's theme.

It includes additional gameplay features, slightly improved visuals, and a new translation that follows Japanese naming conventions for the spells and monsters. It does not, however, have the full-motion videos from the PlayStation version of the game. Four new espers appear in ''Advance'': [[Leviathan]], [[Gilgamesh (Final Fantasy)|Gilgamesh]], [[Cactuar]], and Diabolos. Two new areas include the Dragons' Den dungeon, which includes the Kaiser Dragon, a monster coded, but not included, in the original, and a \"Soul Shrine\", a place where the player can fight monsters continuously. Three new spells also appear, and several bugs from the original are fixed. In addition, similarly to the other handheld ''Final Fantasy'' re-releases, a bestiary and a music player are included. Even in the Japanese version, the music player is in English and uses the American names, e.g. ''Strago'' over ''Stragus''.<ref name=\"FF6Guide\">{{cite book |title= Final Fantasy VI Official Complete Guide |date=January 2007 |publisher= Square Enix| location= Japan |language= Japanese |isbn= 978-4-7575-1846-9 |page= 011 }}</ref> The package features new artwork by series veteran and original character and image designer [[Yoshitaka Amano]].<ref name=\"Villoria2007\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/final-fantasy-vi/764893p1.html|title=Final Fantasy VI Advance|last=Villoria|first=Gerald|date=2007-02-14|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=2014-04-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731010118/http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/final-fantasy-vi/764893p1.html|archivedate=2013-07-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe original [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on March 15, 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comu4w/virtual_console_march/ |title=Final Fantasy VI Set for Virtual Console |author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=2011-02-25 |publisher=andriasang.com |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225041129/http://andriasang.com/comu4w/virtual_console_march/ |archivedate=2012-12-25 }}</ref> in PAL territories (Europe and Australia) on March 18, 2011, and in North America on June 30, 2011.<ref name=Siliconera>{{cite web|title=Final Fantasy VI Finally Hits The U.S. Virtual Console |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/06/30/final-fantasy-vi-finally-hits-the-u-s-virtual-console/ |work=Siliconera |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2011-06-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704223401/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/06/30/final-fantasy-vi-finally-hits-the-u-s-virtual-console/ |archivedate=2011-07-04 }}</ref> The game was released in the West with its original North American title of ''Final Fantasy III''.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|author=Spencer |title=Final Fantasy VI Moogle Slamming Virtual Console In North America |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/04/16/final-fantasy-vi-moogle-slamming-virtual-console-in-north-america/ |work=Siliconera |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2011-04-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420131753/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/04/16/final-fantasy-vi-moogle-slamming-virtual-console-in-north-america/ |archivedate=2011-04-20 }}</ref> The Super Famicom version was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan.

III''''' from its marketing for its initial North American release in 1994, is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by Japanese company [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. ''Final Fantasy VI'', being the sixth game in the series proper, was the first to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]; the role was filled instead by [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Hiroyuki Ito]]. [[Yoshitaka Amano]], long-time collaborator to the ''Final Fantasy'' series, returned as the character designer and contributed widely to visual concept design, while series-regular, composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], wrote the [[music of Final Fantasy VI|game's score]], which has been released on several [[soundtrack album]]s. Set in a fantasy world with technology resembling that of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], the game's story follows an expanding cast that includes fourteen permanent [[player character|playable characters]]. The drama includes and extends past depicting a rebellion against an evil military dictatorship, pursuit of a magical arms-race, use of chemical weapons in warfare, depiction of violent, apocalyptic confrontations with Divinities, several personal redemption arcs, teenage pregnancy, and the continuous renewal of hope and life itself.\n\n''Final Fantasy VI'' was released to critical acclaim and is seen as a landmark title for the role-playing genre; for instance, it was ranked as the 2nd best RPG of all time by [[IGN]] in 2017. Its SNES and PlayStation versions have sold over 3.48 million copies worldwide to date as a stand-alone game, as well as over 750,000 copies as part of the Japanese ''[[Final Fantasy Collection]]'' and the North American ''Final Fantasy Anthology''. ''Final Fantasy VI'' has won numerous awards and is considered by many to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]].\n\nIt was ported by [[Tose (company)|Tose]] with minor differences to [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999 and Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2006, and it was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in 2011. In 2017, [[Nintendo]] re-released ''Final Fantasy VI'' as part of the company's [[Super NES Classic Edition]].<ref name=\"Super NES Classic Edition\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic|title=Super NES Classic Edition|publisher=[[Nintendo of America, Inc.]]|date=September 29, 2017}}</ref> The game was known as ''Final Fantasy III'' when it was first released in North America, as the original ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' had not been released outside Japan at the time (leaving [[Final Fantasy IV|IV]] as the second title released outside Japan and VI as the third). However, most later localizations use the original title.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike previous ''Final Fantasy'' installments, ''Final Fantasy VI'' consists of four basic modes of [[gameplay]]: an [[overworld]] map, town and [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon]] field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's [[fictional universe|fictional world]], which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, [[chocobo]], and [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Airships and transport|airship]]. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are [[random encounter|randomly encountered]] on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track [[experience point|experience points and levels]].<ref name=\"basicinfo\">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | page=39 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>\n\nThe game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful information and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate [[quest (video gaming)|side-quests]]. Dungeons appear as a variety of areas, including caves, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Dungeons may feature puzzles and mazes, with some dungeons requiring the player to divide the characters into multiple parties which must work together to advance through the dungeon.<ref name=\"basicinfo\"/>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:Final Fantasy VI battle.png|thumb|left|A battle in ''Final Fantasy VI''|alt=A battle scene, with four of the heroes on the right and two larger four-footed monsters on the left. The figures are displayed on a green field with mountains in the background, and the names and status of the figures is displayed in blue boxes in the bottom third of the screen.]]\n\nCombat in ''Final Fantasy VI'' is [[menu (computing)|menu]]-based, in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four characters may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional [[Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistic]]. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' ''Runic'' ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.<ref name=\"FF6battle\">{{cite web|url= http://na.square-enix.com/games/anthology/FFVI/battle.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309000344/http://na.square-enix.com/games/anthology/FFVI/battle.html|archivedate=2008-03-09 |title=Final Fantasy VI\u2014Battle Systems | year=2002 | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref>\n\nAnother element is the Desperation Attack, [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy|a powerful attack substitution]] that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later ''Final Fantasy'' titles under a variety of different names, including Limit Breaks, Trances, and Overdrives.<ref name=\"ff7ign\">{{cite web | url = http://au.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii | title = IGN Presents: The History of Final Fantasy VII | website = IGN | date = 2008-04-30 | accessdate = 2009-04-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128130134/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/01/ign-presents-the-history-of-final-fantasy-vii|archivedate=2014-01-28}}</ref> Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with [[experience point]]s and money, called [[Gil (Final Fantasy)|gil]] ([[Gold coin|Gold Piece]] (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.<ref name=\"FF6battle\"/>\n\n===Customization===\nCharacters in ''Final Fantasy VI'' can be equipped with a variety of weapons, armor and, particular to this entry, powerful accessories known as \"Relics\". Weapons and armor increase combat capability mostly by increasing statistics and adding beneficial effects to attacks. By comparison, Relics have a variety of uses and effects, are almost entirely interchangeable among party members, and are extended in sophistication to alter basic battle commands and exceed normal limitations of the game's systems.\n\nAlthough in ''Final Fantasy VI'' only two playable characters start the game with the ability to use magic, magic may later be taught to almost all other playable characters through the game's introduction of magicite and the Espers that magicite shards contain. \"Espers\" are the game's incarnation of the series' trope of \"summons\", powerful monstrous beings, many of which are recurring throughout the series, such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin. Besides those returning from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VI'' features approximately two dozen of them in total, with more added to later versions of the game.\n\nThe setting and plot of the game revolve heavily around Espers and their remains when deceased, which are referred to as \"magicite\". Each piece of magicite has a specific set of magic spells that a character can learn when they are equipped with it in the menu. Additionally, some pieces of magicite grant a statistical bonus to a character when they gain a level. Finally, when a character equips a piece of magicite, they may summon the corresponding Esper during battle.<ref name=\"basicinfo3\">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | page=47 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- This section has been edited to comply with the featured article criteria.

This plot is meant to be as comprehensive as possible, while only containing the details needed to understand the plot at its most basic level. -->\n\n===Setting===\nInstead of the strictly [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[fantasy]] settings featured in previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles, ''Final Fantasy VI'' is set in a world that also has prominent [[steampunk]] influences. The structure of society is similar to that of the latter half of the 19th century, with [[opera]] and the [[fine art]]s serving as recurring motifs throughout the game,<ref name=\"NPC in Jidor\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(NPC in Jidoor)''' You like art? No? Philistines!}}</ref> and a level of technology comparable to that of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. During the first half of the game, the planet is referred to as the World of Balance, and is divided into three lush continents. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges, the southern continent has been mostly subjugated by the cruel Gestahl Empire, and the eastern continent is home to the Veldt, a massive wilderness inhabited by monsters from all over the world. An apocalyptic event mid-game transforms the planet into the World of Ruin; its withering landmasses are fractured into numerous islands surrounding a larger continent.\n\nThe game alludes to a conflict known as the \"War of the Magi,\" which occurred one thousand years prior to the beginning of the game. In this conflict, three quarreling entities known as the \"Warring Triad\" used innocent humans as soldiers by transforming them into enslaved magical beings called Espers. The Triad realized their wrongdoings; they freed the espers and sealed their own powers inside three stone statues.<ref name=\"Statues\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES|quote='''Left statue:''' The birth of magic... three goddesses were banished here. In time they began quarreling, which led to all-out war. Those unlucky humans who got in the way were transformed to Espers, and used as living war machines. / '''Right Statue:''' The goddesses finally realized that they were being laughed at by those who had banished them here. In a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to seal themselves away from the world. With their last ounce of energy they gave the Espers back their own free will, and then transformed themselves... ...into stone. Their only request was that the Espers keep them sealed away from all eternity. / '''Center Statue:''' The Espers created these statues as a symbol of their vow to let the goddesses sleep in peace. The Espers have sworn to keep the goddesses' power from being abused.}}</ref> As a precaution, the espers sealed off both the statues and themselves from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology.<ref name=\"Game opening\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(Game opening)''' Long ago, the War of the Magi reduced the world to a scorched wasteland, and magic simply ceased to exist. 1000 years have passed... Iron, gunpowder and steam engines have been rediscovered, and high technology reigns...}}</ref> At the game's opening, the Empire has taken advantage of the weakening barrier between the human and esper domains, capturing several espers in the process. Using these espers as a power source, the Empire has created \"Magitek\", a craft that combines magic with machinery (including [[mecha|mechanical infantry]]) and infuses humans with magical powers.<ref name=\"Magitek Armor\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(Soldier)''' Open up! Give us back the girl and the Empire's Magitek Armor!}}</ref> The Empire is opposed by the Returners, a rebel organization seeking to free the subjugated lands.\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|Characters of Final Fantasy VI}}\n\n''Final Fantasy VI'' features fourteen permanent [[player character|playable characters]], the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, [[Terra Branford]], is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love.<ref name=\"Slave Crown\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''Wedge:''' Not to worry. The Slave Crown on her head robs her of all conscious thought. She'll follow our orders.}}</ref> Other primary characters include [[Locke Cole]], a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; [[Celes Chere]], a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; [[Edgar Roni Figaro]], a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners;<ref name=Edgar>'''Locke:''' On the surface, Edgar pretends to support the Empire.

The clownish Kefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights, rendering him insane; his actions throughout the game reflect his demented nature.<ref name=\"NPC in Vector\">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super NES |quote='''(NPC in Vector)''' That guy Kefka?

Upon locating it, a magical reaction occurs between Terra and the Esper; as a result, the soldiers accompanying Terra are killed and Terra is knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, Terra is informed that the Empire had been using a device called a \"slave crown\" to control her actions. With the crown now removed, Terra cannot remember anything more than her name and her rare ability to use magic unaided.<ref>'''Terra:''' You... saved me? / '''Locke:''' Save your thanks for the Moogles! / '''Terra:''' Uhh...

The most obvious of these is the change of the game's title from ''Final Fantasy VI'' to ''Final Fantasy III''; because only two games of the series had been localized in North America at the time, ''Final Fantasy VI'' was distributed as ''Final Fantasy III'' to maintain naming continuity. Unlike ''Final Fantasy IV'' (which was first released in North America as ''Final Fantasy II''), there are no major changes to gameplay,<ref name=\"EGM63\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Final Fantasy III|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=63|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1994|page=172}}</ref> though several changes of contents and editorial adjustments exist in the English script. In a January 1995 interview with ''[[Super Play]]'' magazine, translator [[Ted Woolsey]] explained that \"there's a certain level of playfulness and ... sexuality in Japanese games that just doesn't exist here [in the USA], basically because of [[Nintendo of America]]'s rules and guidelines\".<ref name=\"SPWoolseyint\">{{cite journal |date=September 1994 |title=Fantasy Quest: Interview with Ted Woolsey |journal=[[Super Play]] |volume=1 |issue=23 |page= |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |issn=0966-6192 }}</ref> Consequently, objectionable graphics (e.g. nudity) were censored and building signs in towns were changed (such as Bar being changed to Caf\u00e9), as well as religious allusions (e.g. the spell ''Holy'' was renamed ''Pearl'').<ref name=\"RPGFF6retroreview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6/reviews/ff6strev3.html |title=Final Fantasy VI \u2013 Staff Re-Retroview |last=Beckett |first=Michael |publisher=RPGamer |accessdate=2009-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913140835/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6/reviews/ff6strev3.html |archivedate=2010-09-13 }}</ref>\n\nAlso, some direct allusions to death, killing actions, and violent expressions, as well as offensive words have been replaced by softer expressions. For example, after Edgar, Locke and Terra flee on chocobos from Figaro Castle, Kefka orders two Magitek Armored soldiers to chase them by shouting \"Go! KILL THEM!\", in the Japanese version. It was translated as \"Go! Get them!\" Also, when Imperial Troopers burn Figaro Castle, and Edgar claims Terra is not hidden inside the castle, Kefka replies \"then you can burn to death\" in the Japanese version, which was replaced in the English version by \"Then welcome to my barbecue!\". Similarly, as Magitek soldiers watch Edgar and his guests escape on Chocobos, Kefka swears in Japanese, which was translated by Ted Woolsey as \"Son of a submariner!\".<ref name=\"RPGFF6retroreview\"/> The localization also featured changes to several names, such as \"Tina\" being changed to \"Terra\". Finally, dialogue text files had to be shortened due to the limited data storage space available on the game cartridge's [[read-only memory]].<ref name=\"SPWoolseyint\"/> As a result, additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space.<ref name=\"SPWoolseyint\"/>\n\nThe PlayStation re-release featured only minor changes to the English localization. The title of the game was reverted to ''Final Fantasy VI'' from ''Final Fantasy III'', to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. A few item and character names were adjusted, as in the expansion of \"Fenix Down\" to \"Phoenix Down\". Unlike the PlayStation re-release of ''Final Fantasy IV'' included in the later ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' compilation, the script was left essentially unchanged.<ref name=\"RPGFFFAreview\" /> The Game Boy Advance re-release featured a new translation by a different translator, Tom Slattery.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |title=Final Fantasy VI advance info |website=[[GameFAQs]] |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/gba/930370-final-fantasy-vi-advance/data |accessdate=2007-05-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513220851/http://www.gamefaqs.com/gba/930370-final-fantasy-vi-advance/data |archivedate=2010-05-13 }}</ref> This translation preserved most of the character names, location names, and terminology from the Woolsey translation, but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series.<ref name=\"IGNFF6Areview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/15/final-fantasy-vi-advance-review |title=IGN: Final Fantasy VI Advance Review |accessdate=2009-01-12 |website=IGN |author=Dunham, Jeremy |date=2007-02-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104043613/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/15/final-fantasy-vi-advance-review |archivedate=2012-11-04 }}</ref> The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others, and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the original translation.<ref name=\"Schreier2007\">{{cite web |author=Schreier, Jason |year=2007 |title=Final Fantasy VI Advance Staff Review |publisher=RPGamer |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6gba/reviews/ff6gbastrev2.html |accessdate=2007-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203128/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6gba/reviews/ff6gbastrev2.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> The [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] release used the ''Final Fantasy III'' name of the SNES game.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Final Fantasy VI}}\n\nThe soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy VI'' was composed by long-time series contributor [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The score consists of themes for each major character and location, as well as music for standard battles, fights with [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] enemies and for special cutscenes. The extensive use of [[leitmotif]] is one of the defining points of the audio tracks. The \"[[Aria di Mezzo Carattere]]\" is one of the latter tracks, played during a cutscene involving an [[opera]] performance. This track features an unintelligible synthesized \"voice\" that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the [[Nintendo S-SMP|SPC700]] [[Timeline of audio formats|sound format]] chip prevented the use of an actual [[vocal music|vocal track]] (although some developers eventually figured out how to overcome the limitation a few years later). The orchestral album ''[[Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale]]'' features an arranged version of the [[aria]], using Italian [[lyrics]] performed by Svetla Krasteva with an orchestral accompaniment. This version is also found in the ending [[full motion video]] of the game's [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] re-release, with the same lyrics but a different musical [[arrangement]].

It includes additional gameplay features, slightly improved visuals, and a new translation that follows Japanese naming conventions for the spells and monsters. It does not, however, have the full-motion videos from the PlayStation version of the game. Four new espers appear in ''Advance'': [[Leviathan]], [[Gilgamesh (Final Fantasy)|Gilgamesh]], [[Cactuar]], and Diabolos. Two new areas include the Dragons' Den dungeon, which includes the Kaiser Dragon, a monster coded, but not included, in the original, and a \"Soul Shrine\", a place where the player can fight monsters continuously. Three new spells also appear, and several bugs from the original are fixed. In addition, similarly to the other handheld ''Final Fantasy'' re-releases, a bestiary and a music player are included. Even in the Japanese version, the music player is in English and uses the American names, e.g. ''Strago'' over ''Stragus''.<ref name=\"FF6Guide\">{{cite book |title= Final Fantasy VI Official Complete Guide |date=January 2007 |publisher= Square Enix| location= Japan |language= Japanese |isbn= 978-4-7575-1846-9 |page= 011 }}</ref> The package features new artwork by series veteran and original character and image designer [[Yoshitaka Amano]].<ref name=\"Villoria2007\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/final-fantasy-vi/764893p1.html|title=Final Fantasy VI Advance|last=Villoria|first=Gerald|date=2007-02-14|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=2014-04-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731010118/http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/final-fantasy-vi/764893p1.html|archivedate=2013-07-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe original [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on March 15, 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comu4w/virtual_console_march/ |title=Final Fantasy VI Set for Virtual Console |author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=2011-02-25 |publisher=andriasang.com |accessdate=2011-02-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225041129/http://andriasang.com/comu4w/virtual_console_march/ |archivedate=2012-12-25 }}</ref> in PAL territories (Europe and Australia) on March 18, 2011, and in North America on June 30, 2011.<ref name=Siliconera>{{cite web|title=Final Fantasy VI Finally Hits The U.S. Virtual Console |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/06/30/final-fantasy-vi-finally-hits-the-u-s-virtual-console/ |work=Siliconera |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2011-06-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704223401/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/06/30/final-fantasy-vi-finally-hits-the-u-s-virtual-console/ |archivedate=2011-07-04 }}</ref> The game was released in the West with its original North American title of ''Final Fantasy III''.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|author=Spencer |title=Final Fantasy VI Moogle Slamming Virtual Console In North America |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/04/16/final-fantasy-vi-moogle-slamming-virtual-console-in-north-america/ |work=Siliconera |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2011-04-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420131753/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/04/16/final-fantasy-vi-moogle-slamming-virtual-console-in-north-america/ |archivedate=2011-04-20 }}</ref> The Super Famicom version was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan.
