In 1977, the city and county governments consolidated to form the sole entity of Butte-Silver Bow. The city covers {{convert|718|mi2|0}}, and, according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], has a population of 33,503, making it Montana's fifth largest city. It is served by [[Bert Mooney Airport]] with airport code BTM.\n\nEstablished in 1864 as a [[mining camp]] in the northern [[Rocky Mountains]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], Butte experienced rapid development in the late-nineteenth century, and was Montana's first major industrial city.<ref name=historyculture/> In its heyday between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, it was one of the largest copper [[boomtown]]s in the [[American West]]. Employment opportunities in the mines attracted surges of Asian and European immigrants, particularly the [[Irish people|Irish]]; as of 2017, Butte has the largest population of [[Irish Americans]] per capita of any city in the United States.<ref name=irish/>\n\nButte was also the site of various historical events involving its mining industry and active [[trade union|labor union]]s and [[Socialism|Socialist]] politics, the most famous of which was the [[Butte, Montana labor riots of 1914|labor riot of 1914]]. Despite the dominance of the [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda Copper Mining Company]], Butte was never a [[company town]]. Other major events in the city's history include the [[Speculator Mine disaster|1917 Speculator Mine disaster]], the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history.\n\nOver the course of its history, Butte's mining and [[smelting]] operations generated an excess of $48 billion worth of [[ore]], but also resulted in numerous environmental implications for the city: The upper [[Clark Fork River]], with headwaters at Butte, is the largest [[List of Superfund sites|Superfund site]] in the United States, and the city is also home to the [[Berkeley Pit]]. In the late-twentieth century, cleanup efforts from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] were instated, and the [[Butte Citizens Technical Environmental Committee]] was established in 1984. In the 21st century, efforts at interpreting and preserving Butte's heritage are addressing both the town's historical significance and the continuing importance of mining to its economy and culture. The city's Uptown Historic District, on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is one of the largest [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark Districts]] in the United States, containing nearly 6,000 contributing properties.<ref name=nrhp/> The city is also home to [[Montana Tech of the University of Montana|Montana Tech]], a public engineering and technical university.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Butte, Montana}}\n\n===Early history and immigrants===\nPrior to Butte's formal establishment in 1864, the area consisted of a mining camp that had developed in the early 1860s.{{sfn|Ring|Watson|Schellinger|2013|p=70}} The city is located in the Silver Bow Creek Valley (or Summit Valley), a natural bowl sitting high in the Rockies straddling the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]],{{sfn|Malone|2006|pages=3\u20134}} positioned on the southwestern side of a large mass of [[granite]] known as the [[Boulder Batholith]], which dates to the [[Cretaceous]] era.<ref name=deq/> In 1874, William L.

The Chinese migrations stopped in 1882 with the passage of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]]. There was anti-Chinese sentiment in the 1870s and onwards due to racism on the part of the white settlers, exacerbated by economic depression, and in 1895, the chamber of commerce and labor unions started a boycott of Chinese owned businesses. The business owners fought back by suing the unions and winning.

He was a part-owner, mine manager and engineer of the Alice, a silver mine in Walkerville, a suburb of Butte. While working in the Alice, he noticed significant quantities of high grade copper ore. Daly obtained permission to inspect nearby workings. After Daly's employers, the Walker Brothers, refused to buy the Anaconda, Daly sold his interest in the Alice and bought it himself. Daly asked [[George Hearst]], San Francisco mining magnate, for additional support. Hearst agreed to buy one-fourth of the new company's stock without visiting the site. While mining the silver left in his mine, huge deposits of [[copper]] were soon developed and Daly became a copper magnate. When surrounding silver mines \"played out\" and closed, Daly quietly bought up the neighboring mines, forming a mining company. Daly built a smelter at [[Anaconda, Montana]] (a company town) and connected his smelter to Butte by a railway. Anaconda Company eventually owned all the mines on Butte Hill.<ref>Laurie Mercier, ''Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City'' (University of Illinois Press, 2001)</ref>\n\nBetween 1884 and 1888, W.A.

In 1977, the city and county governments consolidated to form the sole entity of Butte-Silver Bow. The city covers {{convert|718|mi2|0}}, and, according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], has a population of 33,503, making it Montana's fifth largest city. It is served by [[Bert Mooney Airport]] with airport code BTM.\n\nEstablished in 1864 as a [[mining camp]] in the northern [[Rocky Mountains]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], Butte experienced rapid development in the late-nineteenth century, and was Montana's first major industrial city.<ref name=historyculture/> In its heyday between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, it was one of the largest copper [[boomtown]]s in the [[American West]]. Employment opportunities in the mines attracted surges of Asian and European immigrants, particularly the [[Irish people|Irish]]; as of 2017, Butte has the largest population of [[Irish Americans]] per capita of any city in the United States.<ref name=irish/>\n\nButte was also the site of various historical events involving its mining industry and active [[trade union|labor union]]s and [[Socialism|Socialist]] politics, the most famous of which was the [[Butte, Montana labor riots of 1914|labor riot of 1914]]. Despite the dominance of the [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda Copper Mining Company]], Butte was never a [[company town]]. Other major events in the city's history include the [[Speculator Mine disaster|1917 Speculator Mine disaster]], the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history.\n\nOver the course of its history, Butte's mining and [[smelting]] operations generated an excess of $48 billion worth of [[ore]], but also resulted in numerous environmental implications for the city: The upper [[Clark Fork River]], with headwaters at Butte, is the largest [[List of Superfund sites|Superfund site]] in the United States, and the city is also home to the [[Berkeley Pit]]. In the late-twentieth century, cleanup efforts from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] were instated, and the [[Butte Citizens Technical Environmental Committee]] was established in 1984. In the 21st century, efforts at interpreting and preserving Butte's heritage are addressing both the town's historical significance and the continuing importance of mining to its economy and culture. The city's Uptown Historic District, on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is one of the largest [[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark Districts]] in the United States, containing nearly 6,000 contributing properties.<ref name=nrhp/> The city is also home to [[Montana Tech of the University of Montana|Montana Tech]], a public engineering and technical university.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Butte, Montana}}\n\n===Early history and immigrants===\nPrior to Butte's formal establishment in 1864, the area consisted of a mining camp that had developed in the early 1860s.{{sfn|Ring|Watson|Schellinger|2013|p=70}} The city is located in the Silver Bow Creek Valley (or Summit Valley), a natural bowl sitting high in the Rockies straddling the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]],{{sfn|Malone|2006|pages=3\u20134}} positioned on the southwestern side of a large mass of [[granite]] known as the [[Boulder Batholith]], which dates to the [[Cretaceous]] era.<ref name=deq/> In 1874, William L.

The Chinese migrations stopped in 1882 with the passage of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]]. There was anti-Chinese sentiment in the 1870s and onwards due to racism on the part of the white settlers, exacerbated by economic depression, and in 1895, the chamber of commerce and labor unions started a boycott of Chinese owned businesses. The business owners fought back by suing the unions and winning.

He was a part-owner, mine manager and engineer of the Alice, a silver mine in Walkerville, a suburb of Butte. While working in the Alice, he noticed significant quantities of high grade copper ore. Daly obtained permission to inspect nearby workings. After Daly's employers, the Walker Brothers, refused to buy the Anaconda, Daly sold his interest in the Alice and bought it himself. Daly asked [[George Hearst]], San Francisco mining magnate, for additional support. Hearst agreed to buy one-fourth of the new company's stock without visiting the site. While mining the silver left in his mine, huge deposits of [[copper]] were soon developed and Daly became a copper magnate. When surrounding silver mines \"played out\" and closed, Daly quietly bought up the neighboring mines, forming a mining company. Daly built a smelter at [[Anaconda, Montana]] (a company town) and connected his smelter to Butte by a railway. Anaconda Company eventually owned all the mines on Butte Hill.<ref>Laurie Mercier, ''Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana's Smelter City'' (University of Illinois Press, 2001)</ref>\n\nBetween 1884 and 1888, W.A.
