Church, \"Introduction\", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), vii.</ref> [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|Social Contract]] argued that each person was born with rights, and they would come together to form a government that would then protect those rights. Under the social contract, the government was required to act for the [[general will]], which represented the interests of everyone rather than a few factions.<ref>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, \"Ideal Empires and Republics.

The leaders felt their ideal version of government was threatened from the inside and outside of France, and terror was the only way to preserve the dignity of the Republic created from French Revolution.<ref name=\"sourcebooks.fordham.edu\"/>\n\nRobespierre's ideology was not strictly derived from Rousseau. The writings of another Enlightenment thinker of the time, [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], greatly influenced Robespierre. One of Montesquieu's writings, ''The Spirit of the Laws'',  defines a core principle of a democratic government: virtue. He describes it as \"the love of laws and of our country.\"<ref>Montesquieu. \"Modern History Sourcebook: Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws, 1748.\" Internet History Sourcebooks. https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/montesquieu-spirit.asp.</ref>  In Robespierre's speech to the [[National Convention]] on 5 February 1794, ''On Political Morality'', he talks about virtue being the \"fundamental principle of popular or democratic government.\"<ref>Robespierre, \"On Political Morality\", ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/413.</ref>  This was, in fact, the same virtue defined by Montesquieu almost 50 years earlier. Robespierre believed that the virtue needed for any democratic government was extremely lacking in the French people. As a result, he decided to weed out those he believed could never possess this virtue. The result was a continual push towards Terror. The Convention used this as justification for the course of action to \"crush the enemies of the revolution, ... let the laws be executed, \u2026 and let liberty be saved.\"<ref>\"Terror Is the Order of the Day\", ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'', accessed 26 October 2018, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/416.</ref>\n\nThese members of the Enlightenment movement greatly influenced revolutionary leaders; however, cautions from other Enlightenment thinkers were blatantly ignored.   [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] warnings were often overlooked, though some of his ideas were used for justification of the Revolution and the start of the Terror. He protested against Catholic Dogmas and the ways of Christianity, stating, \"of all religions, the Christian should, of course, inspire the most toleration, but till now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.\" These criticisms were often used by Robespierre and other leaders as justification for their anti-religious reforms. Voltaire also laid down some warnings. In his [[Dictionnaire philosophique|''Philosophical Dictionary'']], he states, \"we are all steeped in weakness and error; let us forgive each other our follies; that is the first law of nature\" and \"every individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of his opinion, is a monster.\"<ref>Voltaire. \"Voltaire, Selections from the Philosophical Dictionary.\" Omeka RSS. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/273/.</ref>\n\n===Threats of foreign invasion===\nAfter the beginning of the French Revolution, the surrounding monarchies did not show great hostility towards the rebellion.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution''. 6th ed. London: Routledge, 2016. 54.</ref> Though mostly ignored, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was later able to find support in Leopold II of Austria (Marie Antoinette's brother) and Frederick William II of Prussia. On 27 August 1791, these foreign leaders made the [[Declaration of Pillnitz|Pillnitz Declaration]], saying they would restore the French monarch if other European rulers joined. In response to what they viewed to be the meddling of foreign powers, [[Campaigns of 1792 in the French Revolutionary Wars|France declared war]] on 20 April 1792.<ref>Gunther E. Rothenberg \"The Origins, Causes, and Extension of the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon.\" ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 18, no. 4 (1988): 771-93. doi:10.2307/204824. https://www.jstor.org/stable/204824.</ref> However, at this point, the war was only Prussia and Austria against France. France began this war with a large series of defeats, which set a precedent of fear of invasion in the people that would last throughout the war. Massive reforms of military institutions, while very effective in the long run, presented the initial problems of inexperienced forces and leaders of questionable political loyalty.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 55.</ref> In the time it took for officers of merit to use their new freedoms to climb the chain of command, France suffered. Many of the early battles were definitive losses for the French.{{cn|date=March 2020}} There was the constant threat of the Austro-Prussian forces which were advancing easily toward the capital, threatening to destroy Paris if the monarch was harmed.<ref>Leopold II, and Frederick William. \"The Declaration of Pillnitz (1791).\" French Revolution. 27 February 2018. Accessed 26 October 2018. https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/declaration-of-pillnitz-1791/.</ref> This series of defeats, coupled with militant uprisings and protests within the borders of France, pushed the government to resort to drastic measures to ensure the loyalty of every citizen, not only to France but more importantly to the Revolution.\n\nWhile this series of losses was eventually broken, the reality of what might have happened if they persisted hung over France. The tide would not turn from them until September 1792 when the French won a [[Battle of Valmy|critical victory at Valmy]] preventing the Austro-Prussian invasion.<ref>Jermemy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 59.</ref> While the French military had stabilized and was producing victories by the time the Reign of Terror officially began, the pressure to succeed in this international struggle acted as justification for the government to pursue its tyrannical actions. It was not until after the [[execution of Louis XVI]] and the annexation of the [[Rhineland#French Revolution|Rhineland]] that the other monarchies began to feel threatened enough to form the [[War of the First Coalition|First Coalition]]. The Coalition, consisting of Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Sardinia began attacking France from all directions, besieging and capturing ports and retaking ground lost to France.<ref>Marjorie Bloy. \"The First Coalition 1793-1797.\" A Web of English History. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/montesquieu/.</ref> With so many similarities to the first days of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]] for the French government, with threats on all sides, unification of the country became a top priority.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 64.</ref> As the war continued and the Reign of Terror began, leaders saw a correlation between using terror and achieving victory. Well phrased by [[Albert Soboul]], \"terror, at first an improvised response to defeat, once organized became an instrument of victory.\"<ref>Soboul cited in Mona Ozouf. \"War and Terror in French Revolutionary Discourse (1792-1794).\" ''The Journal of Modern History'' 56, no. 4 (1984): 580-97. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1880323.\n</ref> The threat of defeat and foreign invasion may have helped spur the origins of the Terror, but the timely coincidence of the Terror with French victories added justification to its growth.\n\n=== Popular pressure ===\nDuring the Reign of Terror, the [[sans-culottes]] and the [[H\u00e9bertists]] put pressure on the [[National Convention]] delegates and contributed to the overall instability of France. The National Convention was bitterly split between the [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]] and the [[Girondins]]. The Girondins were more conservative leaders of the National Convention, while the Montagnards supported radical violence and pressures of the lower classes.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin, A Short History of the French Revolution, (London: Routledge, 2016), 64.</ref> Once the Montagnards gained control of the National Convention, they began demanding radical measures. Moreover, the sans-culottes, the urban workers of France, agitated leaders to inflict punishments on those who opposed the interests of the poor. The sans-culottes\u2019 violent demonstrations pushing their demands, created constant pressure for the Montagnards to enact reform.<ref>\"Terror, Vengeance, and Martyrdom in the French Revolution: THE CASE OF THE SHADES - Oxford Scholarship\", 2014, accessed 1 May 2018, http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199959853.001.0001/acprof-9780199959853-chapter-8. 2014.</ref> The sans-culottes fed the frenzy of instability and chaos by utilizing popular pressure during the Revolution. For example, the sans-culottes sent letters and petitions to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] urging them to protect their interests and rights with measures such as taxation of foodstuffs that favored workers over the rich. They advocated for arrests of those deemed to oppose reforms against those with privilege, and the more militant members would advocate pillage in order to achieve the desired equality.<ref>Albert Soboul, ''The Sans-culottes; the Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793\u20131794'', (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1972), 5\u201317.</ref> The resulting instability caused problems that made forming the new Republic and achieving full political support critical.\n\n=== Religious upheaval ===\n\nThe Reign of Terror was characterized by a dramatic rejection of long-held religious authority, its hierarchical structure, and the corrupt and intolerant influence of the aristocracy and clergy. Religious elements that long stood as symbols of stability for the French people, were replaced by reason and scientific thought.<ref>Edmond Pressense, John Lacroix,  ''Religion and the reign of terror, or, The church during the French revolution'' (World constitutions illustrated), (New York : Cincinnati: Carlton & Lanahan ; Hitchcock & Walden, 1869).</ref><ref>Emmet Kennedy.

In 1789, church lands were expropriated and priests killed or forced to leave France.<ref name=\"Lynn Hunt p 3\"/> A [[Cult of Reason|Festival of Reason]] was held in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], which was renamed \"The Temple of Reason\", and the old traditional calendar was replaced with a new revolutionary one.<ref name=\"Jeremy D. Popkin 2016\"/> The leaders of the Terror tried to address the call for these radical, revolutionary aspirations, while at the same time trying to maintain tight control on the de-Christianization movement that was threatening to the clear majority of the still devoted Catholic population of France. The tension sparked by these conflicting objectives laid a foundation for the \"justified\" use of terror to achieve revolutionary ideals and rid France of the religiosity that revolutionaries believed was standing in the way.\n\n== Major events during the Terror ==\n{{Main|History of France#Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)|France#Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)}}\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n[[File:Robespierre crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maximilien Robespierre]], member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]]]\n\nOn 10 March 1793 the National Convention set up the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]].

It was ratified by public [[referendum]], but never put into force.\n\nOn 13 July 1793 the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]] \u2013 a [[Jacobin]] leader and journalist \u2013 resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution) |August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France |king]], was removed from the Committee of Public Safety on 10 July 1793.

On 17 September, the [[Law of Suspects]] was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined \"suspects\". This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September, the Convention extended [[price fixing]] from grain and bread to other essential goods, and also fixed wages.\n\nOn 10 October the Convention decreed that \"the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace\". On 24 October the [[French Republican Calendar]] was enacted. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day, they were executed on 31 October.\n\nAnti-clerical sentiments increased during 1793 and a campaign of dechristianization occurred. On 10 November (20 Brumaire Year II of the French Republican Calendar), the H\u00e9bertists organized a [[Cult of Reason| Festival of Reason]].\n\n[[File:Olympe gouges.jpg|thumb|upright|The execution of [[Olympe de Gouges]], feminist writer close to the Girondins]]\nOn 14 Frimaire (5 December 1793) the National Convention passed the [[Law of Frimaire]], which gave the central government more control over the actions of the [[Repr\u00e9sentant en mission | representatives on mission]].\n\nOn 16 Pluvi\u00f4se (4 February 1794), the National Convention decreed the abolition of slavery in all of France and in French colonies.\n\nOn 8 and 13 Vent\u00f4se (26 February and 3 March 1794), [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just| Saint-Just]] proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the [[Vent\u00f4se Decrees]].\n\nBy the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the Revolutionary Government: the [[H\u00e9bertists]], who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the [[Dantonistes | Dantonists]], led by [[Georges Danton]], who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both. The major H\u00e9bertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. The Dantonists were arrested on 30 March, tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April.\n\nOn 20 Prairial (8 June 1794) the Festival of the Supreme Being was celebrated across the country; this was part of the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], a deist national religion. On 22 Prairial (10 June), the National Convention passed a law proposed by [[Georges Couthon]], known as the [[Law of 22 Prairial]], which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period from this time to the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] became known{{by whom?|date=January 2020}} as \"The Great Terror\" ({{lang-fr | la Grande Terreur}}).\n\nOn 8 Messidor (26 June 1794), the French army won the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)| Battle of Fleurus]], which marked a turning point in [[Flanders campaign | France's military campaign]] and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Thermidorian Reaction ==\n{{Main|Thermidorian Reaction}}\n[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|right|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]]]\n\nThe fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that, after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate's own head at risk. Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Merda. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, makes it impossible to be sure of the wound's origin. In any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day.<ref>Merriman, John (2004). \"Thermidor\" (2nd ed.). ''A history of modern Europe: from the Renaissance to the present'', p 507. W.W.

Church, \"Introduction\", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), vii.</ref> [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|Social Contract]] argued that each person was born with rights, and they would come together to form a government that would then protect those rights. Under the social contract, the government was required to act for the [[general will]], which represented the interests of everyone rather than a few factions.<ref>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, \"Ideal Empires and Republics.

The leaders felt their ideal version of government was threatened from the inside and outside of France, and terror was the only way to preserve the dignity of the Republic created from French Revolution.<ref name=\"sourcebooks.fordham.edu\"/>\n\nRobespierre's ideology was not strictly derived from Rousseau. The writings of another Enlightenment thinker of the time, [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], greatly influenced Robespierre. One of Montesquieu's writings, ''The Spirit of the Laws'',  defines a core principle of a democratic government: virtue. He describes it as \"the love of laws and of our country.\"<ref>Montesquieu. \"Modern History Sourcebook: Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws, 1748.\" Internet History Sourcebooks. https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/montesquieu-spirit.asp.</ref>  In Robespierre's speech to the [[National Convention]] on 5 February 1794, ''On Political Morality'', he talks about virtue being the \"fundamental principle of popular or democratic government.\"<ref>Robespierre, \"On Political Morality\", ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/413.</ref>  This was, in fact, the same virtue defined by Montesquieu almost 50 years earlier. Robespierre believed that the virtue needed for any democratic government was extremely lacking in the French people. As a result, he decided to weed out those he believed could never possess this virtue. The result was a continual push towards Terror. The Convention used this as justification for the course of action to \"crush the enemies of the revolution, ... let the laws be executed, \u2026 and let liberty be saved.\"<ref>\"Terror Is the Order of the Day\", ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'', accessed 26 October 2018, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/416.</ref>\n\nThese members of the Enlightenment movement greatly influenced revolutionary leaders; however, cautions from other Enlightenment thinkers were blatantly ignored.   [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] warnings were often overlooked, though some of his ideas were used for justification of the Revolution and the start of the Terror. He protested against Catholic Dogmas and the ways of Christianity, stating, \"of all religions, the Christian should, of course, inspire the most toleration, but till now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.\" These criticisms were often used by Robespierre and other leaders as justification for their anti-religious reforms. Voltaire also laid down some warnings. In his [[Dictionnaire philosophique|''Philosophical Dictionary'']], he states, \"we are all steeped in weakness and error; let us forgive each other our follies; that is the first law of nature\" and \"every individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of his opinion, is a monster.\"<ref>Voltaire. \"Voltaire, Selections from the Philosophical Dictionary.\" Omeka RSS. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/273/.</ref>\n\n===Threats of foreign invasion===\nAfter the beginning of the French Revolution, the surrounding monarchies did not show great hostility towards the rebellion.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution''. 6th ed. London: Routledge, 2016. 54.</ref> Though mostly ignored, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was later able to find support in Leopold II of Austria (Marie Antoinette's brother) and Frederick William II of Prussia. On 27 August 1791, these foreign leaders made the [[Declaration of Pillnitz|Pillnitz Declaration]], saying they would restore the French monarch if other European rulers joined. In response to what they viewed to be the meddling of foreign powers, [[Campaigns of 1792 in the French Revolutionary Wars|France declared war]] on 20 April 1792.<ref>Gunther E. Rothenberg \"The Origins, Causes, and Extension of the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon.\" ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 18, no. 4 (1988): 771-93. doi:10.2307/204824. https://www.jstor.org/stable/204824.</ref> However, at this point, the war was only Prussia and Austria against France. France began this war with a large series of defeats, which set a precedent of fear of invasion in the people that would last throughout the war. Massive reforms of military institutions, while very effective in the long run, presented the initial problems of inexperienced forces and leaders of questionable political loyalty.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 55.</ref> In the time it took for officers of merit to use their new freedoms to climb the chain of command, France suffered. Many of the early battles were definitive losses for the French.{{cn|date=March 2020}} There was the constant threat of the Austro-Prussian forces which were advancing easily toward the capital, threatening to destroy Paris if the monarch was harmed.<ref>Leopold II, and Frederick William. \"The Declaration of Pillnitz (1791).\" French Revolution. 27 February 2018. Accessed 26 October 2018. https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/declaration-of-pillnitz-1791/.</ref> This series of defeats, coupled with militant uprisings and protests within the borders of France, pushed the government to resort to drastic measures to ensure the loyalty of every citizen, not only to France but more importantly to the Revolution.\n\nWhile this series of losses was eventually broken, the reality of what might have happened if they persisted hung over France. The tide would not turn from them until September 1792 when the French won a [[Battle of Valmy|critical victory at Valmy]] preventing the Austro-Prussian invasion.<ref>Jermemy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 59.</ref> While the French military had stabilized and was producing victories by the time the Reign of Terror officially began, the pressure to succeed in this international struggle acted as justification for the government to pursue its tyrannical actions. It was not until after the [[execution of Louis XVI]] and the annexation of the [[Rhineland#French Revolution|Rhineland]] that the other monarchies began to feel threatened enough to form the [[War of the First Coalition|First Coalition]]. The Coalition, consisting of Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Sardinia began attacking France from all directions, besieging and capturing ports and retaking ground lost to France.<ref>Marjorie Bloy. \"The First Coalition 1793-1797.\" A Web of English History. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/montesquieu/.</ref> With so many similarities to the first days of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]] for the French government, with threats on all sides, unification of the country became a top priority.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 64.</ref> As the war continued and the Reign of Terror began, leaders saw a correlation between using terror and achieving victory. Well phrased by [[Albert Soboul]], \"terror, at first an improvised response to defeat, once organized became an instrument of victory.\"<ref>Soboul cited in Mona Ozouf. \"War and Terror in French Revolutionary Discourse (1792-1794).\" ''The Journal of Modern History'' 56, no. 4 (1984): 580-97. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1880323.\n</ref> The threat of defeat and foreign invasion may have helped spur the origins of the Terror, but the timely coincidence of the Terror with French victories added justification to its growth.\n\n=== Popular pressure ===\nDuring the Reign of Terror, the [[sans-culottes]] and the [[H\u00e9bertists]] put pressure on the [[National Convention]] delegates and contributed to the overall instability of France. The National Convention was bitterly split between the [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]] and the [[Girondins]]. The Girondins were more conservative leaders of the National Convention, while the Montagnards supported radical violence and pressures of the lower classes.<ref>Jeremy D. Popkin, A Short History of the French Revolution, (London: Routledge, 2016), 64.</ref> Once the Montagnards gained control of the National Convention, they began demanding radical measures. Moreover, the sans-culottes, the urban workers of France, agitated leaders to inflict punishments on those who opposed the interests of the poor. The sans-culottes\u2019 violent demonstrations pushing their demands, created constant pressure for the Montagnards to enact reform.<ref>\"Terror, Vengeance, and Martyrdom in the French Revolution: THE CASE OF THE SHADES - Oxford Scholarship\", 2014, accessed 1 May 2018, http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199959853.001.0001/acprof-9780199959853-chapter-8. 2014.</ref> The sans-culottes fed the frenzy of instability and chaos by utilizing popular pressure during the Revolution. For example, the sans-culottes sent letters and petitions to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] urging them to protect their interests and rights with measures such as taxation of foodstuffs that favored workers over the rich. They advocated for arrests of those deemed to oppose reforms against those with privilege, and the more militant members would advocate pillage in order to achieve the desired equality.<ref>Albert Soboul, ''The Sans-culottes; the Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793\u20131794'', (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1972), 5\u201317.</ref> The resulting instability caused problems that made forming the new Republic and achieving full political support critical.\n\n=== Religious upheaval ===\n\nThe Reign of Terror was characterized by a dramatic rejection of long-held religious authority, its hierarchical structure, and the corrupt and intolerant influence of the aristocracy and clergy.

The tension sparked by these conflicting objectives laid a foundation for the \"justified\" use of terror to achieve revolutionary ideals and rid France of the religiosity that revolutionaries believed was standing in the way.\n\n== Major events during the Terror ==\n{{Main|History of France#Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)|France#Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)}}\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n[[File:Robespierre crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maximilien Robespierre]], member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]]]\n\nOn 10 March 1793 the National Convention set up the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. Among those charged by the tribunal, about half were acquitted (though the number dropped to about a quarter after the enactment of the [[Law of 22 Prairial]] on 10 June 1794). In March [[War in the Vend\u00e9e | rebellion broke out]] in the [[Vend\u00e9e]] in response to mass conscription, which developed into a civil war. Discontent in the Vend\u00e9e  lasted \u2013 according to some accounts \u2013 until after the Terror.\n\nOn 6 April 1793 the National Convention established the [[Committee of Public Safety]], which gradually became the ''de facto'' war-time government of France.<ref>{{cite journal | author-link= Hilary Mantel | last= Mantel | first= Hilary | url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n15/hilary-mantel/he-roared | title= He Roared | journal= London Review of Books | date= 6 August 2009 | volume= 3 | issue= 15 | pages= 3\u20136 | accessdate= 16 January 2010 | ref= harv}}</ref>  \nThe Committee oversaw the Reign of Terror. \"During the Reign of Terror, at least 300,000 suspects were arrested; 17,000 were officially executed, and perhaps 10,000 died in prison or without trial.\" <ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title= Reign of Terror |url= https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror |encyclopedia= Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate= 24 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 June 1793 the Parisian sans-culottes surrounded the National Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed-price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral [[suffrage| franchise]] to sans-culottes alone. With the backing of the [[National Guard (France)| national guard]], they persuaded the Convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders.<ref>Jones, Peter. ''The French Revolution 1787\u20131804''. Pearson Education, 2003, p. 57.</ref> In reaction to the imprisonment of the Girondin deputies, some thirteen departments started the [[Federalist revolts]] against the National Convention in Paris, which were ultimately crushed.\n\nOn 24 June 1793 the Convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, the [[French Constitution of 1793]]. It was ratified by public [[referendum]], but never put into force.\n\nOn 13 July 1793 the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]] \u2013 a [[Jacobin]] leader and journalist \u2013 resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution) |August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France |king]], was removed from the Committee of Public Safety on 10 July 1793. On 27 July 1793 Robespierre became part of the Committee of Public Safety.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maximilien-Robespierre|title= Maximilien Robespierre {{!}} Biography, Facts, & Execution|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date= 2017-09-19|language= en}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 August 1793 the National Convention decreed the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' - \"The young men shall fight; the married man shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn all lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public square in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic.\"<ref>\n[http://ahrf.revues.org/document1385.html#bodyftn15 Original French text]\n</ref>\n\n[[File:La fourn\u00e9e des Girondins 10-11-1793.jpg|thumb|The execution of the [[Girondins]]]]\nOn 9 September the Convention established paramilitary forces, the \"revolutionary armies\", to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September, the [[Law of Suspects]] was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined \"suspects\". This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September, the Convention extended [[price fixing]] from grain and bread to other essential goods, and also fixed wages.\n\nOn 10 October the Convention decreed that \"the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace\". On 24 October the [[French Republican Calendar]] was enacted. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day, they were executed on 31 October.\n\nAnti-clerical sentiments increased during 1793 and a campaign of dechristianization occurred. On 10 November (20 Brumaire Year II of the French Republican Calendar), the H\u00e9bertists organized a [[Cult of Reason| Festival of Reason]].\n\n[[File:Olympe gouges.jpg|thumb|upright|The execution of [[Olympe de Gouges]], feminist writer close to the Girondins]]\nOn 14 Frimaire (5 December 1793) the National Convention passed the [[Law of Frimaire]], which gave the central government more control over the actions of the [[Repr\u00e9sentant en mission | representatives on mission]].\n\nOn 16 Pluvi\u00f4se (4 February 1794), the National Convention decreed the abolition of slavery in all of France and in French colonies.\n\nOn 8 and 13 Vent\u00f4se (26 February and 3 March 1794), [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just| Saint-Just]] proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the [[Vent\u00f4se Decrees]].\n\nBy the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the Revolutionary Government: the [[H\u00e9bertists]], who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the [[Dantonistes | Dantonists]], led by [[Georges Danton]], who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both. The major H\u00e9bertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. The Dantonists were arrested on 30 March, tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April.\n\nOn 20 Prairial (8 June 1794) the Festival of the Supreme Being was celebrated across the country; this was part of the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], a deist national religion. On 22 Prairial (10 June), the National Convention passed a law proposed by [[Georges Couthon]], known as the [[Law of 22 Prairial]], which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period from this time to the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] became known{{by whom?|date=January 2020}} as \"The Great Terror\" ({{lang-fr | la Grande Terreur}}).\n\nOn 8 Messidor (26 June 1794), the French army won the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)| Battle of Fleurus]], which marked a turning point in [[Flanders campaign | France's military campaign]] and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Thermidorian Reaction ==\n{{Main|Thermidorian Reaction}}\n[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|right|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]]]\n\nThe fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that, after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate's own head at risk. Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Merda. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, makes it impossible to be sure of the wound's origin. In any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day.<ref>Merriman, John (2004). \"Thermidor\" (2nd ed.). ''A history of modern Europe: from the Renaissance to the present'', p 507. W.W.

New members were appointed the day after Robespierre's execution, and limits on terms of office were fixed (a quarter of the committee retired every three months). The Committee's powers were gradually eroded.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Bals des victimes]]\n* [[Great Purge]]\n* [[Infernal columns]]\n* [[Tricoteuse]]\n* [[Drownings at Nantes]]\n* [[State terrorism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Bloy, Marjorie. \"The First Coalition 1793-1797.\" A Web of English History.
