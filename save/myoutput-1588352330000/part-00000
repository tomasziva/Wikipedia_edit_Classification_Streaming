American aerospace engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] was responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced [[radar cross-section]]. At one point, a [[strategic bomber|bomber]] variant of the aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the reconnaissance role included [[signals intelligence]] sensors, a [[side-looking airborne radar]], and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General [[Curtis LeMay]], who preferred the SR (''Strategic Reconnaissance'') designation over simply RS (''Reconnaissance''). The aircraft was introduced to operational service in January 1966.\n\nDuring [[aerial reconnaissance]] missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes ({{convert|85000|ft|m|sigfig=3|disp=comma|abbr=off|sp=us}}) to allow it to outrace threats. If a [[surface-to-air missile]] [[Missile approach warning system|launch was detected]], the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile.<ref name=\"SR71 Blackbird 2006\">\"SR-71 Blackbird.\" PBS documentary, Aired: 15 November 2006.</ref> On average, each SR-71 could fly once per week due to the extended turnaround required after mission recovery.

Since its retirement, the SR-71's role has been taken up by a combination of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs); a proposed UAV successor, the [[Lockheed Martin SR-72]], has not yet been pursued.

In late 1957, the CIA approached the defense contractor [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] to build an undetectable spy plane. The project, named Archangel, was led by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], head of Lockheed's Skunk Works unit in Burbank, California. The work on project Archangel began in the second quarter of 1958, with aim of flying higher and faster than the U-2. Of 11 successive designs drafted in a span of 10 months, \"A-10\" was the front-runner. Despite this, however, its shape made it vulnerable to radar detection. After a meeting with the CIA in March 1959, the design was modified to have a 90% reduction in radar cross-section. The CIA approved a US$96 million contract for Skunk Works to build a dozen spy planes, named \"[[Lockheed A-12|A-12]]\" on 11 February 1960. The [[1960 U-2 incident|1960 downing]] of [[Francis Gary Powers]]'s U-2 underscored its vulnerability and the need for faster reconnaissance aircraft such as the A-12.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 85.</ref>\n\nThe A-12 first flew at Groom Lake ([[Area 51]]), Nevada, on 25 April 1962. Thirteen were built; two variants were also developed, including three of the [[Lockheed YF-12|YF-12]] interceptor prototype, and two of the [[Lockheed M-21|M-21]] drone carrier. The aircraft was meant to be powered by the [[Pratt & Whitney J58]] engine, but development ran over schedule, and it was equipped instead with the less powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J75]] initially. The J58s were retrofitted as they became available, and became the standard powerplant for all subsequent aircraft in the series (A-12, YF-12, M-21), as well as the SR-71. The A-12 flew missions over Vietnam and North Korea before its retirement in 1968. The program's cancellation was announced on 28 December 1966,<ref>McIninch 1996, p. 31.</ref> due both to budget concerns<ref name=\"futile\">Robarge, David.

USAF Chief of Staff General [[Curtis LeMay]] preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation and wanted the RS-71 to be named SR-71. Before the July speech, LeMay lobbied to modify Johnson's speech to read \"SR-71\" instead of \"RS-71\".

Along with its low radar cross-section, these qualities gave a very short time for an enemy [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) site to acquire and track the aircraft on radar. By the time the SAM site could track the SR-71, it was often too late to launch a SAM, and the SR-71 would be out of range before the SAM could catch up to it. If the SAM site could track the SR-71 and fire a SAM in time, the SAM would expend nearly all of the [[delta-v]] of its boost and sustainer phases just reaching the SR-71's altitude; at this point, out of thrust, it could do little more than follow its ballistic arc. Merely accelerating would typically be enough for an SR-71 to evade a SAM;<ref name=\"SR71 Blackbird 2006\"/> changes by the pilots in the SR-71's speed, altitude, and heading were also often enough to spoil any radar lock on the plane by SAM sites or enemy fighters.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> At sustained speeds of more than [[Mach number|Mach]] 3.2, the plane was faster than the Soviet Union's fastest interceptor, the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]], which also could not reach the SR-71's altitude.<ref>[http://www.globalaircraft.org/planes/mig-25_foxbat.pl \"MiG-25 Foxbat.\"] ''globalaircraft.org''.

Lockheed found that washing welded titanium requires [[distilled water]], as the chlorine present in tap water is [[corrosion|corrosive]]; [[cadmium]]-plated tools could not be used, as they also caused corrosion.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> Metallurgical contamination was another problem; at one point, 80% of the delivered titanium for manufacture was rejected on these grounds.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 203.</ref><ref>McIninch 1996, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lockheed M-21 & D-21 drone.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Lockheed M-21]] with a [[Lockheed D-21|D-21]] drone on top|alt= A [[Lockheed M-21]] with [[Lockheed D-21|D-21]] drone on top]]\n\nThe high temperatures generated in flight required special design and operating techniques. Major portions of the skin of the inboard wings were corrugated, not smooth. Aerodynamicists initially opposed the concept, disparagingly referring to the aircraft as a Mach 3 variant of the 1920s-era [[Ford Trimotor]], which was known for its corrugated aluminum skin.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\"/> The heat would have caused a smooth skin to split or curl, whereas the corrugated skin could expand vertically and horizontally and had increased longitudinal strength.\n\nFuselage panels were manufactured to fit only loosely with the aircraft on the ground.

Much of the needed material came from the Soviet Union. Colonel Rich Graham, SR-71 pilot, described the acquisition process: \n<blockquote>The airplane is 92% titanium inside and out. Back when they were building the airplane the United States didn't have the ore supplies \u2013 an ore called [[rutile]] ore.

Moving the spike tip drew the [[shock wave]] riding on it closer to the inlet [[cowling]] until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock wave repeatedly between the spike center body and the inlet inner cowl sides, and minimized airflow [[spillage]] which is the cause of spillage drag. The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic [[Jet engine#Air intakes|diffuser]].<ref>[http://www.personal.psu.edu/cxc11/SR-71_Engines_J-58.ppt \"Penn State- turbo ramjet engines.\"] ''personal.psu.edu''.

It decelerates further in the divergent duct to give the required speed at entry to the compressor. Capture of the plane's shock wave within the inlet is called \"starting the inlet\". [[Bleed tube]]s and bypass doors were designed into the inlet and engine [[nacelle]]s to handle some of this pressure and to position the final shock to allow the inlet to remain \"started\".\n\n[[File:Inlet shock waves at Mach 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schlieren]] flow visualization at [[unstart]] of axisymmetric inlet at Mach 2]]\nIn the early years of operation, the analog computers would not always keep up with rapidly changing flight environmental inputs. If internal pressures became too great and the spike was incorrectly positioned, the shock wave would suddenly blow out the front of the inlet, called an \"inlet [[unstart]]\". During unstarts, afterburner extinctions were common. The remaining engine's asymmetrical thrust would cause the aircraft to yaw violently to one side.

At higher speeds, the engine largely ceased to provide thrust, the afterburner taking its place.<ref name=\"Dryden\"/>\n\nAir was initially compressed (and heated) by the inlet spike and subsequent converging duct between the center body and inlet cowl. The shock waves generated slowed the air to subsonic speeds relative to the engine. The air then entered the engine compressor. Some of this compressor flow (20% at cruise) was removed after the fourth compressor stage and went straight to the afterburner through six bypass tubes. Air passing through the turbojet was compressed further by the remaining five compressor stages and then fuel was added in the combustion chamber. After passing through the turbine, the exhaust, together with the compressor [[bleed air]], entered the afterburner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/manual/1/1-20.php|title=SR-71 Online - SR-71 Flight Manual: Section 1, Page 1-20|website=Sr-71.org}}</ref>\n\nAt around Mach&nbsp;3, the temperature rise from the intake compression, added to the engine compressor temperature rise, reduced the allowable fuel flow because the turbine temperature limit did not change. The rotating machinery produced less power, but still enough to run at 100% RPM, thus keeping the airflow through the intake constant. The rotating machinery had become a drag item<ref>\"Jet Propulsion for Aerospace Applications\" second edition, Hesse and Mumford, Pitman Publishing Corporation, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 64-18757, p375</ref> and the engine thrust at high speeds came from the afterburner temperature rise.<ref>\"F-12 Series Aircraft Propulsion System Performance and Development\" David Campbell, J.

The start cart was positioned underneath the J58 and the two Buick engines powered a single, vertical [[drive shaft]] connecting to the J58 engine and spinning it to above 3,200 RPM, at which point the turbojet could self-sustain. Once the first J58 engine was started, the cart was repositioned to start the aircraft's other J58 engine. Later start carts used [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|Chevrolet big-block]] V8 engines. Eventually, a quieter, pneumatic start system was developed for use at main operating bases. The V8 start carts remained at diversion landing sites not equipped with the pneumatic system.<ref>Landis and Jenkins 2005, pp. 95\u201396.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/startercart.php |title=Starter Cart |website=SR-71 Online |location=US |year=2010 |access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fuel===\n[[File:Boeing KC-135Q refueling SR-71.JPEG|thumb|alt= KC-135 and SR-71 during an \"in-flight\" re-fueling|An SR-71 refueling from a KC-135Q Stratotanker during a flight in 1983]]\n\nSeveral exotic fuels were investigated for the Blackbird. Development began on a [[coal slurry]] power plant, but Johnson determined that the coal particles damaged important engine components.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\"/> Research was conducted on a [[liquid hydrogen]] powerplant, but the tanks for storing [[Cryogenic fuel|cryogenic hydrogen]] were not of a suitable size or shape.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\"/> In practice, the Blackbird would burn somewhat conventional [[JP-7]], which was difficult to light.

The TEB produced a characteristic green flame, which could often be seen during engine ignition.<ref name=\"Shul\"/>\n\nOn a typical SR-71 mission, the airplane took off with only a partial fuel load to reduce stress on the brakes and tires during takeoff and also ensure it could successfully take off should one engine fail. As a result, the SR-71s were typically refueled immediately after takeoff.<ref name=\"Graham, 1996, p. 160\"/> This has led to the misconception that the plane required immediate refueling after takeoff due to leaking fuel tanks. However, leaks were measured in drips per minute, and were not significant compared to the overall capacity.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date=6 August 2013 |title=SR-71 Pilot Interview Richard Graham Veteran Tales |trans-title= |medium= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeBu6mRDaro |access-date=13 August 2019 |time=19:30 |publisher=Veteran Tales Project |via=YouTube}}</ref> The SR-71 also required [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refueling]] to replenish fuel during long-duration missions.

The KC-135Q had a modified high-speed boom, which would allow refueling of the Blackbird at nearly the tanker's maximum airspeed with minimum [[Wing flutter|flutter]]. The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving [[JP-4 (fuel)|JP-4]] (for the KC-135Q itself) and JP-7 (for the SR-71) between different tanks.<ref>Graham, 1996, pp. 38\u201339.</ref> As an aid to the pilot when refueling, the cockpit was fitted with a [[peripheral vision horizon display]]. This unusual instrument projected a barely visible [[artificial horizon]] line across the top of the entire instrument panel, which gave the pilot [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] cues on aircraft attitude.<ref>Paul Crickmore, Lockheed Blackbird: Beyond The Secret Missions, 1993, p. 233.</ref>\n\n===Astro-inertial navigation system{{Anchor|Astro-Inertial Navigation System|Astro-inertial navigation system}}===\nNortronics, [[Northrop Corporation]]'s electronics development division, had developed an [[astro-inertial guidance]] system (ANS), which could correct [[inertial navigation system]] errors with [[Celestial navigation|celestial observations]], for the [[SM-62 Snark]] missile, and a separate system for the ill-fated [[AGM-48 Skybolt]] missile, the latter of which was adapted for the SR-71.<ref>Morrison, Bill, SR-71 contributors, Feedback column, [[Aviation Week and Space Technology]], 9 December 2013, p.10</ref>{{vs|date=February 2012}}\n\nBefore takeoff, a primary alignment brought the ANS's inertial components to a high degree of accuracy.

Instead, the SR-71's camera systems could be located either in the fuselage chines or the removable nose/chine section. Wide-area imaging was provided by two of [[Itek]]'s [[Operational Objective Camera]]s, which provided stereo imagery across the width of the flight track, or an [[KA-80 Optical Bar Camera|Itek Optical Bar Camera]], which gave continuous horizon-to horizon coverage. A closer view of the target area was given by the [[HYCON Technical Objective Camera]] (TEOC), that could be directed up to 45\u00b0 left or right of the centerline.<ref name=Crickmore_p74>Crickmore 1997, p. 74.</ref> Initially, the TEOCs could not match the resolution of the A-12's larger camera, but rapid improvements in both the camera and film improved this performance.<ref name=Crickmore_p74/><ref name=Crickmore_p563>Crickmore 1997, p. 563.</ref>\n\nSLAR, built by [[Goodyear Aerospace]], could be carried in the removable nose. In later life, the radar was replaced by Loral's Advanced [[Synthetic Aperture Radar]] System (ASARS-1). Both the first SLAR and ASARS-1 were ground-mapping imaging systems, collecting data either in fixed swaths left or right of centerline or from a spot location for higher resolution.<ref name=Crickmore_p74/> ELINT-gathering systems, called the Electro Magnetic Reconnaissance System, built by AIL could be carried in the chine bays to analyze electronic signal fields being passed through, and were programmed to identify items of interest.<ref name=Crickmore_p74/><ref name=Crickmore_p77>Crickmore 1997, p. 77.</ref>\n\nOver its operational life, the Blackbird carried various [[electronic countermeasures]] (ECMs), including warning and active electronic systems built by several ECM companies and called Systems A, A2, A2C, B, C, C2, E, G, H, and M. On a given mission, an aircraft carried several of these frequency/purpose payloads to meet the expected threats. Major Jerry Crew, an RSO, told ''[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]]'' that he used a [[Radar jamming and deception|jammer]] to try to confuse [[surface-to-air missile]] sites as their crews tracked his airplane, but once his threat-warning receiver told him a missile had been launched, he switched off the jammer to prevent the missile from homing in on its signal.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/blackbird-diaries-180953373/ |title=Blackbird Diaries {{!}} Flight Today |journal=Air & Space Magazine |page=45 |date=December 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> After landing, information from the SLAR, ELINT gathering systems, and the maintenance data recorder were subjected to postflight ground analysis.

The aircraft was flown to the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]] in March 1990.\n\nThe USAF could fly each SR-71, on average, once per week, because of the extended turnaround required after mission recovery.

The aircraft, which was at 20&nbsp;km altitude, quickly lost altitude and turned 180\u00b0 to the left and turned over Gotland to search for the Swedish coast. Thus, Swedish airspace was violated, whereupon two armed Saab JA 37 Viggens on an exercise at the height of V\u00e4stervik were ordered there. The mission was to do an incident preparedness check and identify an aircraft of high interest. It was found that the plane was in obvious distress and a decision was made that the Swedish Air Force would escort the plane out of the Baltic Sea. A second round of armed JA-37s from \u00c4ngelholm replaced the first pair and completed the escort to Danish airspace. The event had been classified for over 30 years, and when the report was unsealed, data from the NSA showed that a few [[MiG-25]]s with the order to shoot down the SR-71 or force it to land, had started right after the engine failure. A MiG-25 had locked a missile on the damaged SR-71, but as the aircraft was under escort, no missiles were fired. On 29 November 2018, the four Swedish pilots involved were awarded medals from the USAF.<ref>{{Cite web |title=4 Swedish JA-37 Viggen pilots receives medals for SR-71 Blackbird rescue operation 1987 Part:1/2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QV1ZfXGTFY |language=en |access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=4 Swedish JA-37 Viggen pilots receives medals for SR-71 Blackbird rescue operation 1987 Part:2/2  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODRU_MrAQrA |language=en |access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Initial retirement===\nThe SR-71 program was terminated due to [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] politics, and not because the aircraft had become obsolete or irrelevant, or suffered maintenance problems, or had unsustainable program costs, although these reasons are frequently cited as justifications for its downfall.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> In the 1970s and early 1980s, SR-71 squadron and wing commanders were often promoted into higher positions as general officers within the USAF structure and the Pentagon. (In order to be selected into the SR-71 program in the first place, a pilot or navigator (RSO) had to be a top-quality USAF officer, so continuing career progression for members of this elite group was not surprising.) These generals were adept at communicating the value of the SR-71 to an USAF command staff and a Congress who often lacked a basic understanding of how the SR-71 worked and what it did. However, by the mid-1980s, these SR-71 generals all had retired, and a new generation of USAF generals wanted to cut the program's budget and spend its funding on new [[strategic bomber]] programs instead, especially the very expensive [[B-2 Spirit]].<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe USAF saw the SR-71 as a bargaining chip which could be sacrificed to ensure the survival of other priorities. Also, the SR-71 program's \"product\", which was operational and strategic intelligence, was not seen by these generals as being very valuable to the USAF. The primary consumers of this intelligence were the CIA, NSA, and DIA. A general misunderstanding of the nature of aerial reconnaissance and a lack of knowledge about the SR-71 in particular (due to its secretive development and operations) was used by detractors to discredit the aircraft, with the assurance given that a replacement was under development. [[Dick Cheney]] told the Senate Appropriations Committee that the SR-71 cost $85,000 per hour to operate.<ref>Marshall, Eliot, \"The Blackbird's Wake\", Air & Space, October/November 1990, p. 35.</ref> Opponents estimated the aircraft's support cost at $400 to $700 million per year, though the cost was actually closer to $300 million.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe SR-71, while much more capable than the Lockheed U-2 in terms of range, speed, and survivability, suffered the lack of a [[data link]], which the U-2 had been upgraded to carry. This meant that much of the SR-71's imagery and radar data could not be used in real time, but had to wait until the aircraft returned to base. This lack of immediate real-time capability was used as one of the justifications to close down the program. Attempts to add a datalink to the SR-71 were stymied early on by the same factions in the Pentagon and Congress who were already set on the program's demise, even in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> These same factions also forced expensive sensor upgrades to the SR-71, which did little to increase its mission capabilities, but could be used as justification for complaining about the cost of the program.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nIn 1988, Congress was convinced to allocate $160,000 to keep six SR-71s and a trainer model in flyable storage that could become flightworthy within 60 days. However, the USAF refused to spend the money. While the SR-71 survived attempts to retire it in 1988, partly due to the unmatched ability to provide high-quality coverage of the Kola Peninsula for the US Navy,<ref name=\"Crickmore_p84-5\">Crickmore 1997, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> the decision to retire the SR-71 from active duty came in 1989, with the last missions flown in October that year.<ref name=\"Crickmore_p81\">Crickmore 1997, p. 81.</ref> Four months after the plane's retirement, General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], was told that the expedited reconnaissance, which the SR-71 could have provided, was unavailable during [[Operation Desert Storm]].<ref name=\"Remak\">Remak and Ventolo 2001, {{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe SR-71 program's main operational capabilities came to a close at the end of fiscal year 1989 (October 1989). The 1st SRS kept its pilots and aircraft operational and active, and flew some operational reconnaissance missions through the end of 1989 and into 1990, due to uncertainty over the timing of the final termination of funding for the program. The squadron finally closed in mid-1990, and the aircraft were distributed to static display locations, with a number kept in reserve storage.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\">{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Richard |date=7 July 1996 |title=SR-71 Revealed: The Inside Story |url=https://archive.org/details/sr71revealedinsi00colr |publisher=Zenith Press |isbn=978-0760301227 }}</ref>\n\n===Reactivation===\n{{Quote|From the operator's perspective, what I need is something that will not give me just a spot in time but will give me a track of what is happening. When we are trying to find out if the [[Serbs]] are taking arms, moving tanks or artillery into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], we can get a picture of them stacked up on the Serbian side of the bridge. We do not know whether they then went on to move across that bridge. We need the [data] that a tactical, an SR-71, a U-2, or an unmanned vehicle of some sort, will give us, in addition to, not in replacement of, the ability of the satellites to go around and check not only that spot but a lot of other spots around the world for us. It is the integration of strategic and tactical.|Response from Admiral [[Richard C. Macke]] to the Senate Committee on Armed Services.<ref name=\"Senate\"/>}}\n\nDue to unease over political situations in the Middle East and [[North Korea]], the U.S. Congress re-examined the SR-71 beginning in 1993.<ref name=\"Remak\"/> Rear Admiral [[Thomas F. Hall]] addressed the question of why the SR-71 was retired, saying it was under \"the belief that, given the time delay associated with mounting a mission, conducting a reconnaissance, retrieving the data, processing it, and getting it out to a field commander, that you had a problem in timelines that was not going to meet the tactical requirements on the modern battlefield. And the determination was that if one could take advantage of technology and develop a system that could get that data back real time... that would be able to meet the unique requirements of the tactical commander.\" Hall also stated they were \"looking at alternative means of doing [the job of the SR-71].\"<ref name=\"Senate\">\"Department of Defense Authorization for Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1994 and The Future Years.\" ''United States Senate'', May\u2013June 1993.</ref>\n\nMacke told the committee that they were \"flying U-2s, [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135s]], [and] other strategic and tactical assets\" to collect information in some areas.<ref name=\"Senate\"/> Senator [[Robert Byrd]] and other Senators complained that the \"better than\" successor to the SR-71 had yet to be developed at the cost of the \"good enough\" serviceable aircraft. They maintained that, in a time of constrained military budgets, designing, building, and testing an aircraft with the same capabilities as the SR-71 would be impossible.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham 1996</ref>\n\nCongress's disappointment with the lack of a suitable replacement for the Blackbird was cited concerning whether to continue funding imaging sensors on the U-2. Congressional conferees stated the \"experience with the SR-71 serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of failing to keep existing systems up-to-date and capable in the hope of acquiring other capabilities.\"<ref name=\"Graham\"/> It was agreed to add $100 million to the budget to return three SR-71s to service, but it was emphasized that this \"would not prejudice support for long-endurance [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] [such as the [[Global Hawk]]].\" The funding was later cut to $72.5 million.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> The Skunk Works was able to return the aircraft to service under budget at $72 million.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins 2001</ref>\n\nRetired USAF Colonel Jay Murphy was made the Program Manager for Lockheed's reactivation plans. Retired USAF Colonels Don Emmons and Barry MacKean were put under government contract to remake the plane's logistic and support structure. Still-active USAF pilots and Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSOs) who had worked with the aircraft were asked to volunteer to fly the reactivated planes. The aircraft was under the command and control of the [[9th Reconnaissance Wing]] at Beale Air Force Base and flew out of a renovated hangar at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. Modifications were made to provide a data-link with \"near real-time\" transmission of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar's imagery to sites on the ground.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n===Final retirement===\nThe reactivation met much resistance: the USAF had not budgeted for the aircraft, and UAV developers worried that their programs would suffer if money was shifted to support the SR-71s. Also, with the allocation requiring yearly reaffirmation by Congress, long-term planning for the SR-71 was difficult.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> In 1996, the USAF claimed that specific funding had not been authorized, and moved to ground the program. Congress reauthorized the funds, but, in October 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted to use the [[line-item veto]] to cancel the $39 million allocated for the SR-71. In June 1998, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Clinton v. City of New York|line-item veto was unconstitutional]]. All this left the SR-71's status uncertain until September 1998, when the USAF called for the funds to be redistributed; the USAF permanently retired it in 1998.\n\n[[NASA]] operated the two last airworthy Blackbirds until 1999.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-030-DFRC.html \"NASA/DFRC SR-71 Blackbird.\"] ''NASA''.

American aerospace engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] was responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced [[radar cross-section]]. At one point, a [[strategic bomber|bomber]] variant of the aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the reconnaissance role included [[signals intelligence]] sensors, a [[side-looking airborne radar]], and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General [[Curtis LeMay]], who preferred the SR (''Strategic Reconnaissance'') designation over simply RS (''Reconnaissance''). The aircraft was introduced to operational service in January 1966.\n\nDuring [[aerial reconnaissance]] missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes ({{convert|85000|ft|m|sigfig=3|disp=comma|abbr=off|sp=us}}) to allow it to outrace threats.

Since its retirement, the SR-71's role has been taken up by a combination of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs); a proposed UAV successor, the [[Lockheed Martin SR-72]], has not yet been pursued.

In late 1957, the CIA approached the defense contractor [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] to build an undetectable spy plane. The project, named Archangel, was led by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], head of Lockheed's Skunk Works unit in Burbank, California. The work on project Archangel began in the second quarter of 1958, with aim of flying higher and faster than the U-2. Of 11 successive designs drafted in a span of 10 months, \"A-10\" was the front-runner. Despite this, however, its shape made it vulnerable to radar detection. After a meeting with the CIA in March 1959, the design was modified to have a 90% reduction in radar cross-section. The CIA approved a US$96 million contract for Skunk Works to build a dozen spy planes, named \"[[Lockheed A-12|A-12]]\" on 11 February 1960. The [[1960 U-2 incident|1960 downing]] of [[Francis Gary Powers]]'s U-2 underscored its vulnerability and the need for faster reconnaissance aircraft such as the A-12.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 85.</ref>\n\nThe A-12 first flew at Groom Lake ([[Area 51]]), Nevada, on 25 April 1962. Thirteen were built; two variants were also developed, including three of the [[Lockheed YF-12|YF-12]] interceptor prototype, and two of the [[Lockheed M-21|M-21]] drone carrier. The aircraft was meant to be powered by the [[Pratt & Whitney J58]] engine, but development ran over schedule, and it was equipped instead with the less powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J75]] initially. The J58s were retrofitted as they became available, and became the standard powerplant for all subsequent aircraft in the series (A-12, YF-12, M-21), as well as the SR-71. The A-12 flew missions over Vietnam and North Korea before its retirement in 1968. The program's cancellation was announced on 28 December 1966,<ref>McIninch 1996, p. 31.</ref> due both to budget concerns<ref name=\"futile\">Robarge, David.

USAF Chief of Staff General [[Curtis LeMay]] preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation and wanted the RS-71 to be named SR-71. Before the July speech, LeMay lobbied to modify Johnson's speech to read \"SR-71\" instead of \"RS-71\".

Along with its low radar cross-section, these qualities gave a very short time for an enemy [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) site to acquire and track the aircraft on radar. By the time the SAM site could track the SR-71, it was often too late to launch a SAM, and the SR-71 would be out of range before the SAM could catch up to it. If the SAM site could track the SR-71 and fire a SAM in time, the SAM would expend nearly all of the [[delta-v]] of its boost and sustainer phases just reaching the SR-71's altitude; at this point, out of thrust, it could do little more than follow its ballistic arc. Merely accelerating would typically be enough for an SR-71 to evade a SAM;<ref name=\"SR71 Blackbird 2006\"/> changes by the pilots in the SR-71's speed, altitude, and heading were also often enough to spoil any radar lock on the plane by SAM sites or enemy fighters.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> At sustained speeds of more than [[Mach number|Mach]] 3.2, the plane was faster than the Soviet Union's fastest interceptor, the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]], which also could not reach the SR-71's altitude.<ref>[http://www.globalaircraft.org/planes/mig-25_foxbat.pl \"MiG-25 Foxbat.\"] ''globalaircraft.org''.

Lockheed found that washing welded titanium requires [[distilled water]], as the chlorine present in tap water is [[corrosion|corrosive]]; [[cadmium]]-plated tools could not be used, as they also caused corrosion.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> Metallurgical contamination was another problem; at one point, 80% of the delivered titanium for manufacture was rejected on these grounds.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 203.</ref><ref>McIninch 1996, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lockheed M-21 & D-21 drone.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Lockheed M-21]] with a [[Lockheed D-21|D-21]] drone on top|alt= A [[Lockheed M-21]] with [[Lockheed D-21|D-21]] drone on top]]\n\nThe high temperatures generated in flight required special design and operating techniques. Major portions of the skin of the inboard wings were corrugated, not smooth. Aerodynamicists initially opposed the concept, disparagingly referring to the aircraft as a Mach 3 variant of the 1920s-era [[Ford Trimotor]], which was known for its corrugated aluminum skin.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\"/> The heat would have caused a smooth skin to split or curl, whereas the corrugated skin could expand vertically and horizontally and had increased longitudinal strength.\n\nFuselage panels were manufactured to fit only loosely with the aircraft on the ground. Proper alignment was achieved as the airframe heated up and [[thermal expansion|expanded]] several inches.<ref>Graham, 1996, p. 47.</ref> Because of this, and the lack of a fuel-sealing system that could handle the airframe's expansion at extreme temperatures, the aircraft leaked [[JP-7]] fuel on the ground prior to takeoff.<ref name=\"Graham, 1996, p. 160\">Graham, 1996, p. 160.</ref>\n\nThe outer windscreen of the cockpit was made of [[quartz]] and was [[ultrasonic welding|fused ultrasonically]] to the titanium frame.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burrows |first1=William E. |title=The Real X-Jet |journal=Air & Space Magazine |date=1 March 1999 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-real-x-jet-12377380/ |accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref> The temperature of the exterior of the windscreen reached {{convert |600 |\u00b0F |\u00b0C |abbr=on}} during a mission.<ref>Graham, 1996, p. 41.</ref> Cooling was carried out by cycling fuel behind the titanium surfaces in the chines.

Much of the needed material came from the Soviet Union. Colonel Rich Graham, SR-71 pilot, described the acquisition process: \n<blockquote>The airplane is 92% titanium inside and out.

[[Bleed tube]]s and bypass doors were designed into the inlet and engine [[nacelle]]s to handle some of this pressure and to position the final shock to allow the inlet to remain \"started\".\n\n[[File:Inlet shock waves at Mach 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schlieren]] flow visualization at [[unstart]] of axisymmetric inlet at Mach 2]]\nIn the early years of operation, the analog computers would not always keep up with rapidly changing flight environmental inputs.

During unstarts, afterburner extinctions were common. The remaining engine's asymmetrical thrust would cause the aircraft to yaw violently to one side. [[Stability Augmentation System|SAS]], autopilot, and manual control inputs would fight the yawing, but often the extreme off-angle would reduce airflow in the opposite engine and stimulate \"sympathetic stalls\". This generated a rapid counter-yawing, often coupled with loud \"banging\" noises, and a rough ride during which crews' helmets would sometimes strike their cockpit canopies.<ref name=\"Crickmore_p42-3\">Crickmore 1997, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> One response to a single unstart was unstarting both inlets to prevent yawing, then restarting them both.<ref name=landis_jenkins_p97>Landis and Jenkins 2005, p. 97.</ref> After wind tunnel testing and computer modeling by NASA Dryden test center,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Organizations/Technology/Facts/TF-2004-17-DFRC.html |title=NASA Dryden Technology Facts - YF-12 Flight Research Program |publisher=NASA |location=US |year=2004 |access-date=9 March 2019}}</ref> Lockheed installed an electronic control to detect unstart conditions and perform this reset action without pilot intervention.<ref>Rich and Janos 1994, p. 221.</ref> During troubleshooting of the unstart issue, NASA also discovered the vortices from the nose chines were entering the engine and interfering with engine efficiency.

At higher speeds, the engine largely ceased to provide thrust, the afterburner taking its place.<ref name=\"Dryden\"/>\n\nAir was initially compressed (and heated) by the inlet spike and subsequent converging duct between the center body and inlet cowl. The shock waves generated slowed the air to subsonic speeds relative to the engine. The air then entered the engine compressor. Some of this compressor flow (20% at cruise) was removed after the fourth compressor stage and went straight to the afterburner through six bypass tubes. Air passing through the turbojet was compressed further by the remaining five compressor stages and then fuel was added in the combustion chamber. After passing through the turbine, the exhaust, together with the compressor [[bleed air]], entered the afterburner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/manual/1/1-20.php|title=SR-71 Online - SR-71 Flight Manual: Section 1, Page 1-20|website=Sr-71.org}}</ref>\n\nAt around Mach&nbsp;3, the temperature rise from the intake compression, added to the engine compressor temperature rise, reduced the allowable fuel flow because the turbine temperature limit did not change. The rotating machinery produced less power, but still enough to run at 100% RPM, thus keeping the airflow through the intake constant. The rotating machinery had become a drag item<ref>\"Jet Propulsion for Aerospace Applications\" second edition, Hesse and Mumford, Pitman Publishing Corporation, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 64-18757, p375</ref> and the engine thrust at high speeds came from the afterburner temperature rise.<ref>\"F-12 Series Aircraft Propulsion System Performance and Development\" David Campbell, J.

The start cart was positioned underneath the J58 and the two Buick engines powered a single, vertical [[drive shaft]] connecting to the J58 engine and spinning it to above 3,200 RPM, at which point the turbojet could self-sustain. Once the first J58 engine was started, the cart was repositioned to start the aircraft's other J58 engine. Later start carts used [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|Chevrolet big-block]] V8 engines. Eventually, a quieter, pneumatic start system was developed for use at main operating bases. The V8 start carts remained at diversion landing sites not equipped with the pneumatic system.<ref>Landis and Jenkins 2005, pp. 95\u201396.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/startercart.php |title=Starter Cart |website=SR-71 Online |location=US |year=2010 |access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fuel===\n[[File:Boeing KC-135Q refueling SR-71.JPEG|thumb|alt= KC-135 and SR-71 during an \"in-flight\" re-fueling|An SR-71 refueling from a KC-135Q Stratotanker during a flight in 1983]]\n\nSeveral exotic fuels were investigated for the Blackbird. Development began on a [[coal slurry]] power plant, but Johnson determined that the coal particles damaged important engine components.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\"/> Research was conducted on a [[liquid hydrogen]] powerplant, but the tanks for storing [[Cryogenic fuel|cryogenic hydrogen]] were not of a suitable size or shape.<ref name=\"johnson_bio\"/> In practice, the Blackbird would burn somewhat conventional [[JP-7]], which was difficult to light.

The TEB produced a characteristic green flame, which could often be seen during engine ignition.<ref name=\"Shul\"/>\n\nOn a typical SR-71 mission, the airplane took off with only a partial fuel load to reduce stress on the brakes and tires during takeoff and also ensure it could successfully take off should one engine fail. As a result, the SR-71s were typically refueled immediately after takeoff.<ref name=\"Graham, 1996, p. 160\"/> This has led to the misconception that the plane required immediate refueling after takeoff due to leaking fuel tanks. However, leaks were measured in drips per minute, and were not significant compared to the overall capacity.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date=6 August 2013 |title=SR-71 Pilot Interview Richard Graham Veteran Tales |trans-title= |medium= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeBu6mRDaro |access-date=13 August 2019 |time=19:30 |publisher=Veteran Tales Project |via=YouTube}}</ref> The SR-71 also required [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refueling]] to replenish fuel during long-duration missions.

The KC-135Q had a modified high-speed boom, which would allow refueling of the Blackbird at nearly the tanker's maximum airspeed with minimum [[Wing flutter|flutter]].

Instead, the SR-71's camera systems could be located either in the fuselage chines or the removable nose/chine section. Wide-area imaging was provided by two of [[Itek]]'s [[Operational Objective Camera]]s, which provided stereo imagery across the width of the flight track, or an [[KA-80 Optical Bar Camera|Itek Optical Bar Camera]], which gave continuous horizon-to horizon coverage. A closer view of the target area was given by the [[HYCON Technical Objective Camera]] (TEOC), that could be directed up to 45\u00b0 left or right of the centerline.<ref name=Crickmore_p74>Crickmore 1997, p. 74.</ref> Initially, the TEOCs could not match the resolution of the A-12's larger camera, but rapid improvements in both the camera and film improved this performance.<ref name=Crickmore_p74/><ref name=Crickmore_p563>Crickmore 1997, p. 563.</ref>\n\nSLAR, built by [[Goodyear Aerospace]], could be carried in the removable nose. In later life, the radar was replaced by Loral's Advanced [[Synthetic Aperture Radar]] System (ASARS-1).

On a given mission, an aircraft carried several of these frequency/purpose payloads to meet the expected threats. Major Jerry Crew, an RSO, told ''[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]]'' that he used a [[Radar jamming and deception|jammer]] to try to confuse [[surface-to-air missile]] sites as their crews tracked his airplane, but once his threat-warning receiver told him a missile had been launched, he switched off the jammer to prevent the missile from homing in on its signal.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/blackbird-diaries-180953373/ |title=Blackbird Diaries {{!}} Flight Today |journal=Air & Space Magazine |page=45 |date=December 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> After landing, information from the SLAR, ELINT gathering systems, and the maintenance data recorder were subjected to postflight ground analysis.

The aircraft, which was at 20&nbsp;km altitude, quickly lost altitude and turned 180\u00b0 to the left and turned over Gotland to search for the Swedish coast. Thus, Swedish airspace was violated, whereupon two armed Saab JA 37 Viggens on an exercise at the height of V\u00e4stervik were ordered there. The mission was to do an incident preparedness check and identify an aircraft of high interest. It was found that the plane was in obvious distress and a decision was made that the Swedish Air Force would escort the plane out of the Baltic Sea. A second round of armed JA-37s from \u00c4ngelholm replaced the first pair and completed the escort to Danish airspace. The event had been classified for over 30 years, and when the report was unsealed, data from the NSA showed that a few [[MiG-25]]s with the order to shoot down the SR-71 or force it to land, had started right after the engine failure. A MiG-25 had locked a missile on the damaged SR-71, but as the aircraft was under escort, no missiles were fired. On 29 November 2018, the four Swedish pilots involved were awarded medals from the USAF.<ref>{{Cite web |title=4 Swedish JA-37 Viggen pilots receives medals for SR-71 Blackbird rescue operation 1987 Part:1/2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QV1ZfXGTFY |language=en |access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=4 Swedish JA-37 Viggen pilots receives medals for SR-71 Blackbird rescue operation 1987 Part:2/2  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODRU_MrAQrA |language=en |access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Initial retirement===\nThe SR-71 program was terminated due to [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] politics, and not because the aircraft had become obsolete or irrelevant, or suffered maintenance problems, or had unsustainable program costs, although these reasons are frequently cited as justifications for its downfall.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> In the 1970s and early 1980s, SR-71 squadron and wing commanders were often promoted into higher positions as general officers within the USAF structure and the Pentagon. (In order to be selected into the SR-71 program in the first place, a pilot or navigator (RSO) had to be a top-quality USAF officer, so continuing career progression for members of this elite group was not surprising.) These generals were adept at communicating the value of the SR-71 to an USAF command staff and a Congress who often lacked a basic understanding of how the SR-71 worked and what it did. However, by the mid-1980s, these SR-71 generals all had retired, and a new generation of USAF generals wanted to cut the program's budget and spend its funding on new [[strategic bomber]] programs instead, especially the very expensive [[B-2 Spirit]].<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe USAF saw the SR-71 as a bargaining chip which could be sacrificed to ensure the survival of other priorities. Also, the SR-71 program's \"product\", which was operational and strategic intelligence, was not seen by these generals as being very valuable to the USAF. The primary consumers of this intelligence were the CIA, NSA, and DIA. A general misunderstanding of the nature of aerial reconnaissance and a lack of knowledge about the SR-71 in particular (due to its secretive development and operations) was used by detractors to discredit the aircraft, with the assurance given that a replacement was under development. [[Dick Cheney]] told the Senate Appropriations Committee that the SR-71 cost $85,000 per hour to operate.<ref>Marshall, Eliot, \"The Blackbird's Wake\", Air & Space, October/November 1990, p. 35.</ref> Opponents estimated the aircraft's support cost at $400 to $700 million per year, though the cost was actually closer to $300 million.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nThe SR-71, while much more capable than the Lockheed U-2 in terms of range, speed, and survivability, suffered the lack of a [[data link]], which the U-2 had been upgraded to carry. This meant that much of the SR-71's imagery and radar data could not be used in real time, but had to wait until the aircraft returned to base. This lack of immediate real-time capability was used as one of the justifications to close down the program. Attempts to add a datalink to the SR-71 were stymied early on by the same factions in the Pentagon and Congress who were already set on the program's demise, even in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/> These same factions also forced expensive sensor upgrades to the SR-71, which did little to increase its mission capabilities, but could be used as justification for complaining about the cost of the program.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\"/>\n\nIn 1988, Congress was convinced to allocate $160,000 to keep six SR-71s and a trainer model in flyable storage that could become flightworthy within 60 days. However, the USAF refused to spend the money. While the SR-71 survived attempts to retire it in 1988, partly due to the unmatched ability to provide high-quality coverage of the Kola Peninsula for the US Navy,<ref name=\"Crickmore_p84-5\">Crickmore 1997, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> the decision to retire the SR-71 from active duty came in 1989, with the last missions flown in October that year.<ref name=\"Crickmore_p81\">Crickmore 1997, p. 81.</ref> Four months after the plane's retirement, General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], was told that the expedited reconnaissance, which the SR-71 could have provided, was unavailable during [[Operation Desert Storm]].<ref name=\"Remak\">Remak and Ventolo 2001, {{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe SR-71 program's main operational capabilities came to a close at the end of fiscal year 1989 (October 1989). The 1st SRS kept its pilots and aircraft operational and active, and flew some operational reconnaissance missions through the end of 1989 and into 1990, due to uncertainty over the timing of the final termination of funding for the program. The squadron finally closed in mid-1990, and the aircraft were distributed to static display locations, with a number kept in reserve storage.<ref name=\"SR-71 Revealed\">{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Richard |date=7 July 1996 |title=SR-71 Revealed: The Inside Story |url=https://archive.org/details/sr71revealedinsi00colr |publisher=Zenith Press |isbn=978-0760301227 }}</ref>\n\n===Reactivation===\n{{Quote|From the operator's perspective, what I need is something that will not give me just a spot in time but will give me a track of what is happening.

Hall]] addressed the question of why the SR-71 was retired, saying it was under \"the belief that, given the time delay associated with mounting a mission, conducting a reconnaissance, retrieving the data, processing it, and getting it out to a field commander, that you had a problem in timelines that was not going to meet the tactical requirements on the modern battlefield. And the determination was that if one could take advantage of technology and develop a system that could get that data back real time... that would be able to meet the unique requirements of the tactical commander.\" Hall also stated they were \"looking at alternative means of doing [the job of the SR-71].\"<ref name=\"Senate\">\"Department of Defense Authorization for Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1994 and The Future Years.\" ''United States Senate'', May\u2013June 1993.</ref>\n\nMacke told the committee that they were \"flying U-2s, [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135s]], [and] other strategic and tactical assets\" to collect information in some areas.<ref name=\"Senate\"/> Senator [[Robert Byrd]] and other Senators complained that the \"better than\" successor to the SR-71 had yet to be developed at the cost of the \"good enough\" serviceable aircraft. They maintained that, in a time of constrained military budgets, designing, building, and testing an aircraft with the same capabilities as the SR-71 would be impossible.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham 1996</ref>\n\nCongress's disappointment with the lack of a suitable replacement for the Blackbird was cited concerning whether to continue funding imaging sensors on the U-2. Congressional conferees stated the \"experience with the SR-71 serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of failing to keep existing systems up-to-date and capable in the hope of acquiring other capabilities.\"<ref name=\"Graham\"/> It was agreed to add $100 million to the budget to return three SR-71s to service, but it was emphasized that this \"would not prejudice support for long-endurance [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] [such as the [[Global Hawk]]].\" The funding was later cut to $72.5 million.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> The Skunk Works was able to return the aircraft to service under budget at $72 million.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins 2001</ref>\n\nRetired USAF Colonel Jay Murphy was made the Program Manager for Lockheed's reactivation plans. Retired USAF Colonels Don Emmons and Barry MacKean were put under government contract to remake the plane's logistic and support structure. Still-active USAF pilots and Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSOs) who had worked with the aircraft were asked to volunteer to fly the reactivated planes. The aircraft was under the command and control of the [[9th Reconnaissance Wing]] at Beale Air Force Base and flew out of a renovated hangar at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. Modifications were made to provide a data-link with \"near real-time\" transmission of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar's imagery to sites on the ground.<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n===Final retirement===\nThe reactivation met much resistance: the USAF had not budgeted for the aircraft, and UAV developers worried that their programs would suffer if money was shifted to support the SR-71s. Also, with the allocation requiring yearly reaffirmation by Congress, long-term planning for the SR-71 was difficult.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> In 1996, the USAF claimed that specific funding had not been authorized, and moved to ground the program. Congress reauthorized the funds, but, in October 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted to use the [[line-item veto]] to cancel the $39 million allocated for the SR-71. In June 1998, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Clinton v. City of New York|line-item veto was unconstitutional]]. All this left the SR-71's status uncertain until September 1998, when the USAF called for the funds to be redistributed; the USAF permanently retired it in 1998.\n\n[[NASA]] operated the two last airworthy Blackbirds until 1999.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-030-DFRC.html \"NASA/DFRC SR-71 Blackbird.\"] ''NASA''.
