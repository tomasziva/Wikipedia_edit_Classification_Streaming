By the 1950s, most of the land on the north side of the [[Hutchinson River]] was flat land used for recreation; for example, model airplane flying meets were held there. It was possible to drive up to the Hutchinson River, walk along several paths through the reeds, and swim in the Hutchinson River. \n\nThe land to the south of the Hutchinson River (now Section 5 of Co-op City) was unspoiled swampland from the 1950s up through the time Co-op City was constructed. A [[tidal estuary]] reached from the Hutchinson River at the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven Railroad]] along a route just north of Hunter and Boller Avenue to pass under the Hutchinson River Parkway. The estuary was the site of boat yards and canoe rental sites during the 1950s. A well-known restaurant and a night club at that site was Gus's Barge, operated by Gus and Francis Erickson, featuring jazz combos and other forms of live music. The Ericksons also operated a boat yard that rented slips as well as specialized in refurbishing wooden boats, primarily motor boats made from teak and mahogany. The Ericksons sold their property in 1961&ndash;62.\n\nThe site later became the home of a 205-acre theme park named [[Freedomland U.S.A.]].

THESE BUILDINGS STAND ON... - NARA - 549766.jpg|thumb|Co-op City in 1973; the lot in the foreground is a dump]]\n\nThe construction of the community was financed with a mortgage loan from [[New York State Housing Finance Agency]] (HFA). The complex defaulted on the loan in 1975 and has had ongoing agreements to pay back HFA, until 2004 when it was financially unable to continue payments due to the huge costs of emergency repairs. [[New York Community Bank]] helped RiverBay satisfy its $57 million mortgage obligation, except for $95 million in arrears, by refinancing the loan later that same year. This led to the agreement that Co-op City would remain in the [[Mitchell-Lama Housing Program]] for at least seven more years as a concession on the arrears and that any rehabilitation that Co-op City took on to improve the original poor construction (which happened under New York State's watch) would earn credit toward eliminating the debt. By 2008, RiverBay had submitted enough proof of construction repairs to pay off the balance of arrears to New York State.\n\nMismanagement, shoddy construction, and corruption led to the community's defaulting on its loan in 1975. The original Kazan board resigned, and the state took over control. Cooperators, faced with a 25-percent increase in their monthly maintenance fees, organized residents to refuse to pay their monthly maintenance fees. New York State threatened to foreclose on the property and evict the residents, which would mean the loss of their equity. However, cooperators stayed united and held out for 13 months (the longest and largest strike of its kind in United States history) before a compromise was finally reached, with mediation from then-[[Borough president|Bronx Borough President]] [[Robert Abrams]] and then-[[Secretary of State of New York|New York Secretary of State]] [[Mario Cuomo]]. Cooperators would remit $20 million in back payments of maintenance fees, but they would get to take over management of the complex and set their own fees.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/nyregion/10rosen.html |title=Bronx Odyssey: From Rebel to Executive to Felon|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= October 10, 2006|access-date= October 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe shares of stock that prospective purchasers bought to enable them to occupy Co-op City apartments became the subject of protracted litigation, culminating in a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''United Housing Foundation, Inc. v.

The word \"renaissance\" is being used to describe this period in Co-op City history. Many of these efforts are also helping in the \"greening\" of the complex: the power-plant will be less polluting, the buildings will be more efficient and recycling efforts will become more extensive. The [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA) awarded its largest ever grant\u2014$5.2 million\u2014to the community under its NY Energy $mart Assisted Multifamily Program.\n\nIn 2003, after a partial collapse in one garage, inspectors found 5 of the 8 garages to be unsafe and ordered them closed for extensive repairs. The other 3 garages were able to remain partially open during repairs. To deal with the parking crisis, New York City allowed angled parking in the community, the large greenways in the complex were paved over to make outdoor parking lots and agreements were made with nearby shopping centers to use their extra parking spaces. All garages were re-opened by January 2008, and work began to restore the greenways that had been paved.\n\nFinancial responsibility for these upgrades was the subject of a protracted dispute between RiverBay and the State of New York.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/nyregion/residential-real-estate-co-op-city-hires-outside-managers.html \"Co-op City secures $480m loan to pay mortgage, finance repairs\"] ''New York Times''.

RiverBay charged that the state should help with the costs because of severe infrastructure failures stemming from the development's original shoddy construction, which occurred under the supervision of the state. The state countered that RiverBay was responsible for the costs because of its lack of maintenance over the years.

The final cost of this energy independence could be as much as $90 million, but it is hoped to pay for itself with the savings earned\u2014with conservative estimates at $18 million annually\u2014within several years.

By the 1950s, most of the land on the north side of the [[Hutchinson River]] was flat land used for recreation; for example, model airplane flying meets were held there. It was possible to drive up to the Hutchinson River, walk along several paths through the reeds, and swim in the Hutchinson River. \n\nThe land to the south of the Hutchinson River (now Section 5 of Co-op City) was unspoiled swampland from the 1950s up through the time Co-op City was constructed. A [[tidal estuary]] reached from the Hutchinson River at the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven Railroad]] along a route just north of Hunter and Boller Avenue to pass under the Hutchinson River Parkway. The estuary was the site of boat yards and canoe rental sites during the 1950s. A well-known restaurant and a night club at that site was Gus's Barge, operated by Gus and Francis Erickson, featuring jazz combos and other forms of live music. The Ericksons also operated a boat yard that rented slips as well as specialized in refurbishing wooden boats, primarily motor boats made from teak and mahogany. The Ericksons sold their property in 1961&ndash;62.\n\nThe site later became the home of a 205-acre theme park named [[Freedomland U.S.A.]].

The complex defaulted on the loan in 1975 and has had ongoing agreements to pay back HFA, until 2004 when it was financially unable to continue payments due to the huge costs of emergency repairs. [[New York Community Bank]] helped RiverBay satisfy its $57 million mortgage obligation, except for $95 million in arrears, by refinancing the loan later that same year. This led to the agreement that Co-op City would remain in the [[Mitchell-Lama Housing Program]] for at least seven more years as a concession on the arrears and that any rehabilitation that Co-op City took on to improve the original poor construction (which happened under New York State's watch) would earn credit toward eliminating the debt. By 2008, RiverBay had submitted enough proof of construction repairs to pay off the balance of arrears to New York State.\n\nMismanagement, shoddy construction, and corruption led to the community's defaulting on its loan in 1975. The original Kazan board resigned, and the state took over control. Cooperators, faced with a 25-percent increase in their monthly maintenance fees, organized residents to refuse to pay their monthly maintenance fees. New York State threatened to foreclose on the property and evict the residents, which would mean the loss of their equity. However, cooperators stayed united and held out for 13 months (the longest and largest strike of its kind in United States history) before a compromise was finally reached, with mediation from then-[[Borough president|Bronx Borough President]] [[Robert Abrams]] and then-[[Secretary of State of New York|New York Secretary of State]] [[Mario Cuomo]]. Cooperators would remit $20 million in back payments of maintenance fees, but they would get to take over management of the complex and set their own fees.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/nyregion/10rosen.html |title=Bronx Odyssey: From Rebel to Executive to Felon|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= October 10, 2006|access-date= October 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe shares of stock that prospective purchasers bought to enable them to occupy Co-op City apartments became the subject of protracted litigation, culminating in a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''United Housing Foundation, Inc. v.

Many of these efforts are also helping in the \"greening\" of the complex: the power-plant will be less polluting, the buildings will be more efficient and recycling efforts will become more extensive. The [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA) awarded its largest ever grant\u2014$5.2 million\u2014to the community under its NY Energy $mart Assisted Multifamily Program.\n\nIn 2003, after a partial collapse in one garage, inspectors found 5 of the 8 garages to be unsafe and ordered them closed for extensive repairs. The other 3 garages were able to remain partially open during repairs. To deal with the parking crisis, New York City allowed angled parking in the community, the large greenways in the complex were paved over to make outdoor parking lots and agreements were made with nearby shopping centers to use their extra parking spaces. All garages were re-opened by January 2008, and work began to restore the greenways that had been paved.\n\nFinancial responsibility for these upgrades was the subject of a protracted dispute between RiverBay and the State of New York.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/nyregion/residential-real-estate-co-op-city-hires-outside-managers.html \"Co-op City secures $480m loan to pay mortgage, finance repairs\"] ''New York Times''. Accessed September 15, 2004. \"Many of the needed repairs stem from construction-related defects, and Co-op City residents and state officials have been arguing for years over who should pay for them.\"</ref> Co-op City was developed under New York's [[Mitchell-Lama Housing Program|Mitchell-Lama Program]], which subsidizes [[affordable housing]]. RiverBay charged that the state should help with the costs because of severe infrastructure failures stemming from the development's original shoddy construction, which occurred under the supervision of the state. The state countered that RiverBay was responsible for the costs because of its lack of maintenance over the years. In the end, a compromise had the state supplying money and RiverBay refinancing the mortgage, borrowing $480 million from New York Community Bank in 2004, to cover the rest of the capital costs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/nyregion/residential-real-estate-co-op-city-hires-outside-managers.html \"Residential Real Estate; Co-op City Hires Outside Managers\"] ''The New York Times''.

The final cost of this energy independence could be as much as $90 million, but it is hoped to pay for itself with the savings earned\u2014with conservative estimates at $18 million annually\u2014within several years. Also, whatever excess power generated after satisfying the community's needs will be sold back to the electrical grid, adding another source of income for RiverBay.\n\nIn September 2007, a report by the New York Inspector General, Kristine Hamann, charged that the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which is responsible for overseeing Mitchel-Lama developments, was negligent in its duties to supervise the contracting, financial reporting, budgeting and the enforcement of regulations in Co-op City (and other M-L participants) during the period of January 2003 to October 2006. The report also chided Marion Scott management for trying to influence the RiverBay Board by financing election candidates and providing jobs and sports tickets to Board members and their family/friends\u2014all violations of DHCR and/or RiverBay regulations. The DHCR was instructed to overhaul its system of oversight to better protect the residents and taxpayer money.<ref>[http://www.ig.state.ny.us/pdfs/An%20In-Depth%20Review%20of%20the%20Division%20of%20Housing%20and%20Community%20Renewal's%20Oversight%20of%20the%20Mitchell-Lama%20Program.pdf \"An In-Depth Review of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal\u2019s Oversight of the Mitchell-Lama Program\"].

In December 2007, the cable television company [[Cablevision]] gave RiverBay permission to use its fiber optic cables in order to install additional surveillance cameras throughout the complex to be viewed at the Public Safety Command Center. In 2008, trained supervisors were granted the power to write summonses for parking and noise violations and [[Segway PT|Segways]] were acquired \u2013 along with bikes \u2013 to help the officers patrol during the warmer months.\n\nCo-op City was managed by Marion Scott Real Estate, Inc. from October 1999 to November 2014.
