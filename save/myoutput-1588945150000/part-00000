Mike Konczal, an economic policy expert at the [[Roosevelt Institute]], also characterizes Sanders' positions as \"social democracy\" rather than \"socialist\", noting that social democracy means support for a mixed economy combining private enterprise with government spending, social insurance programs, Keynesian macroeconomic policies, and democratic participation in government and the
