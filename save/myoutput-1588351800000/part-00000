A contemporary of the British explorer [[James Cook]], he took part in the [[Seven Years' War]] in North America and the [[American Revolutionary War]] against Britain. Bougainville later gained fame for his expeditions, including circumnavigation of the globe in a scientific expedition in 1763, the first recorded settlement on the [[Falkland Islands]], and voyages into the Pacific Ocean. [[Bougainville Island]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] as well as the [[Bougainvillea]] flower were named after him.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early career ===\nBougainville was born in Paris, the son of a notary, on either 11 or 12 November 1729. In early life, he studied law, but soon abandoned the profession. In 1753 he entered the army in the corps of [[musketeer]]s. At the age of twenty-five he published a treatise on [[integral calculus]], as a supplement to [[Guillaume Fran\u00e7ois Antoine, Marquis de l'H\u00f4pital|De l'H\u00f4pital]]'s treatise, ''Des infiniment petits''.\n\nIn 1755 he was sent to London as secretary to the French embassy, where he was made a member of the [[Royal Society]].\n\n===Seven Years' War (French and Indian War)===\n[[Image:Louis-Antoine de Bougainville portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Young portrait of Louis Antoine de Bougainville.]]\n{{further|France in the Seven Years' War}}\nIn 1756 Bougainville was stationed in Canada as captain of dragoons and [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Marquis de Montcalm]]. He took an active part in the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)|capture of Fort Oswego]] in 1756 and the 1757 [[Battle of Fort William Henry]]. He was wounded in 1758 at the [[Battle of Carillon (1758)|successful defence]] of [[Fort Carillon]]. He sailed back to France the following winter, under orders from the marquis to obtain additional military resources for the colony. During this crossing, he continued to learn about the ways of the sea, skills that would later serve him well. Having distinguished himself in the war against Britain, Bougainville was rewarded with the [[Cross of St Louis]] and promoted to colonel. When he returned to Canada the following year, he had gained few supplies. The metropolitan officials had decided that, \"When the house is on fire, one does not worry about the stables\".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nDuring the pivotal year of 1759 (see [[Seven Years' War]] and [[French and Indian War]]), Bougainville participated in the defence of fortified [[Quebec City|Quebec]], the capital of [[New France]]. With a small elite troop under his command, among which were the ''Grenadiers'' and the ''Volontaires \u00e0 cheval'', he patrolled the north shore of the [[St. Lawrence River]], upstream from the city; he prevented the British several times from landing and cutting communications with Montreal. He did not have sufficient time, however, to rally his troops and attack the British rear when they successfully ascended the [[Plains of Abraham]] and attacked Quebec on 13 September.\n\nFollowing the death of the Marquis de Montcalm and the fall of Qu\u00e9bec on 18 September \u2013 after the colonel's aborted attempt to resupply [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|the besieged city]] \u2013 Bougainville was dispatched to the western front by his new commanding officer, the [[Chevalier de L\u00e9vis]]. He attempted to stop the [[Montreal Campaign|three pronged attack against Montr\u00e9al]] from his entrenchments at [[\u00cele-aux-Noix, Quebec|\u00cele-aux-Noix]]. He was among the officers who accompanied L\u00e9vis to [[Saint Helen's Island]] off Montreal for the last French stand in North America before the general capitulation of 1761. Of the war, Bougainville wrote in his journal: \"It is an abominable kind of war. The very air we breathe is contagious of insensibility and hardness\".<ref>Cave, p.11</ref>\n\nShipped back to Europe along with the other French officers, all deprived of military honours by the victors, Bougainville was prohibited by the terms of surrender from any further active duty against the British. He spent the remaining years of the Seven Years' War (1761 to 1763) as a diplomat, helping to negotiate the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. Under this France ceded most of New France east of the Mississippi River to the [[British Empire]].\n\n===The first French circumnavigation===\n==== \u00celes Malouines settlement ====\n\nAfter the peace, the French decided to colonise the \"Isles Malouines\" ([[Falkland Islands]]). These islands were at that time almost unknown. At his own expense, Bougainville undertook the task of resettling [[Acadians]] who had been deported to France by the British because of their refusal to sign loyalty oaths.\n\nOn 15 September 1763, Bougainville set out from France with the frigate ''L'Aigle'' (Eagle) (captained by Nicolas Pierre Duclos-Guyot) and the sloop ''Le Sphinz'' (Sphinx) (captained by Fran\u00e7ois Chenard de la Giraudais).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=The Falklands/Malvinas Case: Breaking The Deadlock in the Anglo-Argentine Sovereignty Dispute |author=Roberto C.

They landed at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] named after [[King Louis XV]]. A formal ceremony of possession of the Islands was held on 5 April 1764, after which Bougainville and Pernety returned to France. Louis XV formally ratified possession on 12 September 1764.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough the French colony did not number more than 150 people, for financial motivations (Bougainville having paid for the expeditions) and diplomatic reasons (Spain feared that the Falklands would become a rear base to attack her Peruvian gold), Bougainville was ordered by the French government to dismantle his colony and sell it to the Spanish. Bougainville received 200,000 francs in Paris and an additional 500,000 francs in Buenos Aires. Spain agreed to maintain the colony in Port Louis, thus preventing Britain from claiming title to the islands.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Spain had claimed dominion before the French settlement in association with its colonies on the mainland. On 31 January 1767 at [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], Bougainville met Don Felipe Ruiz Puente, commanding the frigate ''La Esmeralda ''and ''La Liebre'' (\"''the Hare''\") and future governor of Islas Malvinas, to transfer possession and evacuate the French population.\n\nBougainville wrote: \n\n<blockquote>It was not before 1766, that the English sent a colony to settle in Port de la Croisade, which they had named [[Port Egmont]]; and captain Macbride, of the Jason frigate, came to our settlement the same year, in the beginning of December. He pretended that these parts belonged to his Britannic majesty, threatened to land by force, if he should be any longer refused that liberty, visited the governor, and sailed away again the same day.<ref>https://archive.org/details/VoyageAroundTheWorldByLewisDeBougainvilleIn1766-9 |\"Voyage Around The World By Lewis De Bougainville in 1766-9\"</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\u00celes Malouines settlement\n|align=center\n|Image:Port-Saint-Louis.jpg|Port St. Louis as established by Bougainville (Dom Pernety, 1769).\n|Image:PortLouis.jpg|Port St. Louis (Federico Lacroix, 1841).\n|Image:Port St Louis in Isles Malouines.jpg|Port St. Louis (Dom Pernety, 1769).\n}}\n\n====Circumnavigation====\n[[Image:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|The ''[[French frigate Boudeuse (1766)|Boudeuse]]'', of Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]\nIn 1766 Bougainville received from [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] permission to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe. He would become the 14th navigator, and the first Frenchman, to sail around the world. Completion of his mission bolstered the prestige of France following its defeats during the [[Seven Years' War]]. This was the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe with professional naturalists and geographers aboard.\n\nBougainville left [[Nantes]] on 15 November 1766 with two ships: [[French frigate La Boudeuse (1766)|''Boudeuse'']] (captain : Nicolas Pierre Duclos-Guyot) and the ''[[French fluyt \u00c9toile (1767)|\u00c9toile]]'' (commanded by Fran\u00e7ois Chenard de la Giraudais). This was a large expedition, with a crew of 214 aboard ''Boudeuse'' and 116 aboard ''\u00c9toile''.\n\nIncluded in the party was the botanist [[Philibert Commer\u00e7on]] (who named the flower ''[[Bougainvillea]]'') and his valet. The ship's surgeon later revealed this person as [[Jeanne Bar\u00e9]], possibly Commer\u00e7on's mistress; she would become the first woman known to circumnavigate the globe. Other notable people on this expedition were Count [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup de la P\u00e9rouse]] (member of the crew); the astronomer [[Pierre-Antoine Veron]]; the surgeon of ''Boudeuse'' Dr. Louis-Claude Laporte; the surgeon of the ''\u00c9toile'' Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Vives; the engineer and cartographer aboard the \u00c9toile Charles Routier de Romainville; and the writer and historian Louis-Antoine Starot de Saint-Germain.<ref name=\"Expedition\" />\n\n====Tahiti====\n[[File:Bougainville at Tahiti.png|thumb|Bougainville reaching Tahiti]]\nHe saw islands of the [[Tuamotu]] group on the following 22 March, on 2 April saw the peak of [[Mehetia]] and visited the island of [[Tahiti|Otaheite]] shortly after. He narrowly missed becoming their discoverer; a previous visit and claim had been made by British explorer [[Samuel Wallis]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']] less than a year previously. Bougainville claimed the island for France and named it ''New Cythera''.\n\nHis expedition left Tahiti and sailed westward to southern [[Samoa]] and the [[New Hebrides]], then on sighting [[Espiritu Santo]] turned west still looking for the ''Southern Continent''. On 4 June he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course to the north and east. He had almost found the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. He sailed through what is now known as the [[Solomon Islands]] but, because of the hostility of the people there, avoided landing. He named [[Bougainville Island]] for himself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The expedition was attacked by people from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] so the French expedition made for the [[Moluccas]]. At [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], they received news of [[Samuel Wallis|Wallis]] and [[Philip Carteret|Carteret]] who had preceded Bougainville in discovering Tahiti.\n\n====Return to France====\n[[File:Bougainville - Trait\u00e9 du calcul int\u00e9gral, 1754 - 162404.jpg|thumb|'' Trait\u00e9 du calcul int\u00e9gral'', 1754]]\n\nOn 16 March 1769 the expedition completed its circumnavigation and arrived at [[St Malo]]. It had lost only seven of its 340 crew, an extremely low level of casualties. This result was considered a credit to the enlightened management of the expedition by Bougainville.<ref name=\"Anne\">{{cite book|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520261143|pages=[https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/90 90,118\u2013119]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/90}}</ref>\n\nBougainville brought Ahutoru back to France, the first Tahitian to sail aboard a European vessel.  In France, Bougainville introduced the Tahitian to high society, including introducing him to the King and Queen at [[Versailles]].  Bougainville also underwrote part of the costs for Ahutoru's return to Tahiti after a two-year absence.  Unfortunately, Ahutoru died en route of [[smallpox]] in October 1771.<ref name=Anne/>{{rp|122\u2013123}}\n\n====''Voyage autour du monde''====\n[[File:Bougainville Voyage around the World 1772.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover page of the English edition of Bougainville's travelogue (1772).]]In 1771, Bougainville published his travel log from the expedition under the title ''Le voyage autour du monde, par la fr\u00e9gate ''La Boudeuse'', et la fl\u00fbte ''L'\u00c9toile (a.k.a. ''Voyage autour du monde'' and ''A Voyage Around the World''). The book describes the geography, biology and anthropology of [[Argentina]] (then a Spanish colony), [[Patagonia]], [[Tahiti]] and [[Indonesia]] (then a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] colony). The book was a sensation, especially the description of Tahitian society. Bougainville described it as an earthly paradise where men and women lived in blissful innocence, far from the corruption of civilisation.\n\nBougainville's descriptions powerfully expressed the concept of the [[noble savage]], influencing the [[utopian]] thoughts of philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] before the advent of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Denis Diderot]]'s book ''[[Suppl\u00e9ment au voyage de Bougainville]]'' retells the story of Bougainville's landing on Tahiti, narrated by an anonymous reader to one of his friends. Diderot used his fictional approach, including a description of the Tahitians as noble savages, to criticise Western ways of living and thinking.<ref name=Anne/>{{rp|117,121}}\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nAfter several years of absence, Bougainville again accepted a naval command. In 1777, he was captain of the [[74-gun]] [[French ship Bien-Aim\u00e9 (1769)|''Bien-Aim\u00e9'']].{{sfnp|Roche|2005|loc=volume 1|p=74}} He took part in the [[War of American Independence]], playing a crucial part in the French victory at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of the Saintes]], Bougainville commanded the 80-gun [[French ship Auguste (1778)|''Auguste'']]. He managed to rally eight ships of his own division, and bringing them safely into [[Sint Eustatius|Saint Eustace]] after the deafeat of [[Comte de Grasse]]. He was promoted to ''[[chef d'escadre]]''. When he re-entered the Army, he was commissioned as ''[[mar\u00e9chal de camp]]''.\n\nAfter [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] in 1783, Bougainville returned to Paris. He obtained the place of associate of the [[Acad\u00e9mie de Marine]]. He proposed a voyage of discovery to the [[North Pole]], but did not gain the support of the French government.\n\n===Promotion and retirement===\n\nIn 1787, he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He obtained the rank of vice-admiral in 1791.\n\nIn 1794, having escaped from the [[Reign of Terror]], he retired to his estate in [[Normandy]]. Returning to Paris, he was one of the founding members of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]]. In 1799, the Consul [[Napoleon]] made him a senator. He died in Paris on 31 August 1811.\n\n==Legacy and honours==\n*[[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]'s name is given to the largest eastern island of [[Papua New Guinea]]; and to the [[Bougainville Strait|strait]] which divides it from the island of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]]. It is also applied to the strait between [[Mallicollo]] and [[Espiritu Santo]] islands of the [[New Hebrides]] group. In the Falklands, [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]], and \"[[Lively Island|Isla Bougainville]]\" (Lively Island's Spanish name) commemorate him.\n*The genus of South American climbing shrubs with colourful bracts, ''[[Bougainvillea]]'', is named after him.\n*1804, he was made a Grand Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1804. \n*1808, Napoleon gave him the title of count (the Comte de Bougainville).\n*Thirteen ships of the [[French Navy]] have been named in his honour, see [[French ship Bougainville|French ship ''Bougainville'']].\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Legacy\n|align=center\n|File:Tomb of Bougainville at the Pantheon.jpg|Tomb of Louis Antoine de Bougainville, at the [[Panth\u00e9on]].\n|Image:Hyacinthe de Bougainville.jpg|[[Hyacinthe de Bougainville]], also a sailor and [[circumnavigator]], was the son of Louis Antoine de Bougainville.\n|File:Bougainville-IMG 8774-black.jpg|Posthumous bust of Bougainville, made in 1831 by [[Bosio Astyanax Scevola]].\n}}\n\n\n==Notes and references==\n[[File:2016-01 Hotel de la Marine 13.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Bougainville at [[H\u00f4tel de la Marine]] (Paris).]]\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|first=Jean-Michel|last=Roche|year=2005|title=Dictionnaire des b\u00e2timents de la flotte de guerre fran\u00e7aise de Colbert \u00e0 nos jours|isbn=978-2-9525917-0-6|oclc=165892922|publisher=Group Retozel-Maury Millau|volume=1|pages=74}}\n* {{cite book|last=Waggaman|first=B\u00e9atrice \u00c9lisabeth|title=Le Voyage autour du monde de Bougainville: droit et imaginaire.|location=Nancy|publisher=Presses universitaires de Nancy|year=1992}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cave|first=Alfred A.|title=The French and Indian Wa|location=New York|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2004}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dunmore|first=John|title=Storms and Dreams: The Life of Louis de Bougainville|location=Fairbanks|publisher=University of Alaska Press|year=2007}}{{ISBN|9781602230019}}.\n* {{cite book|title=Louis-Antoine de Bougainville.\" French and Indian War|year=2003|publisher=HighBeam Research|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114212500/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3411000024.html}}\n\n'''External links '''\n{{EB1911 poster|Bougainville, Louis Antoine de|Louis Antoine de Bougainville}}\n{{Wikisourcelang|fr|Voyage autour du monde|Voyage autour du monde}}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Bougainville,+Louis-Antoine+de,+comte}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Louis Antoine de Bougainville}}\n* [https://archive.org/download/VoyageAroundTheWorldByLewisDeBougainville1766-9/Bougainville_Voyage_Eng_Transcr_JFF.pdf Louis Antoine de Bougainville: \"Voyage around the world 1766\u20131769\", London 1772 (A transcription of the translation of \"Le voyage autour du monde, par la fr\u00e9gate La Boudeuse, et la fl\u00fbte L'\u00c9toile\" into English by John Reinhold Forster)]\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2284 Biography at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']\n*[http://1759.ccbn-nbc.gc.ca/ From the Warpath to the Plains of Abraham (Virtual exhibition)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080708144045/http://pages.quicksilver.net.nz/jcr/~boug1.html Louis-Antoine de Bougainville: Eighteenth Century French Sailor, Soldier, Statesman, Mathematician and leader of a Voyage around the world]\n* [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica] Digital Version Plates\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.litteratureaudio.com/livre-audio-gratuit-mp3/louis-antoine-de-bougainville-voyage-autour-du-monde.html/ Voyage autour du monde, audio version] [[Image:Speaker Icon.svg|20px]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bougainville, Louis Antoine}}\n[[Category:1729 births]]\n[[Category:1811 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at the Panth\u00e9on, Paris]]\n[[Category:Circumnavigators of the globe]]\n[[Category:Counts of the First French Empire]]\n[[Category:Grand Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]\n[[Category:Members of the S\u00e9nat conservateur]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:French explorers]]\n[[Category:French explorers of the Pacific]]\n[[Category:French Navy admirals]]\n[[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:People of New France]]\n[[Category:French people of the French and Indian War]]\n[[Category:Explorers of Chile]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Paris]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name          = Louis Antoine de Bougainville\n|image         = Louis Antoine de Bougainville -

Louis XV formally ratified possession on 12 September 1764.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough the French colony did not number more than 150 people, for financial motivations (Bougainville having paid for the expeditions) and diplomatic reasons (Spain feared that the Falklands would become a rear base to attack her Peruvian gold), Bougainville was ordered by the French government to dismantle his colony and sell it to the Spanish. Bougainville received 200,000 francs in Paris and an additional 500,000 francs in Buenos Aires. Spain agreed to maintain the colony in Port Louis, thus preventing Britain from claiming title to the islands.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Spain had claimed dominion before the French settlement in association with its colonies on the mainland. On 31 January 1767 at [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], Bougainville met Don Felipe Ruiz Puente, commanding the frigate ''La Esmeralda ''and ''La Liebre'' (\"''the Hare''\") and future governor of Islas Malvinas, to transfer possession and evacuate the French population.\n\nBougainville wrote: \n\n<blockquote>It was not before 1766, that the English sent a colony to settle in Port de la Croisade, which they had named [[Port Egmont]]; and captain Macbride, of the Jason frigate, came to our settlement the same year, in the beginning of December. He pretended that these parts belonged to his Britannic majesty, threatened to land by force, if he should be any longer refused that liberty, visited the governor, and sailed away again the same day.<ref>https://archive.org/details/VoyageAroundTheWorldByLewisDeBougainvilleIn1766-9 |\"Voyage Around The World By Lewis De Bougainville in 1766-9\"</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\u00celes Malouines settlement\n|align=center\n|Image:Port-Saint-Louis.jpg|Port St. Louis as established by Bougainville (Dom Pernety, 1769).\n|Image:PortLouis.jpg|Port St. Louis (Federico Lacroix, 1841).\n|Image:Port St Louis in Isles Malouines.jpg|Port St. Louis (Dom Pernety, 1769).\n}}\n\n====Circumnavigation====\n[[Image:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|The ''[[French frigate Boudeuse (1766)|Boudeuse]]'', of Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]\nIn 1766 Bougainville received from [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] permission to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe. He would become the 14th navigator, and the first Frenchman, to sail around the world. Completion of his mission bolstered the prestige of France following its defeats during the [[Seven Years' War]]. This was the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe with professional naturalists and geographers aboard.\n\nBougainville left [[Nantes]] on 15 November 1766 with two ships: [[French frigate La Boudeuse (1766)|''Boudeuse'']] (captain : Nicolas Pierre Duclos-Guyot) and the ''[[French fluyt \u00c9toile (1767)|\u00c9toile]]'' (commanded by Fran\u00e7ois Chenard de la Giraudais). This was a large expedition, with a crew of 214 aboard ''Boudeuse'' and 116 aboard ''\u00c9toile''.\n\nIncluded in the party was the botanist [[Philibert Commer\u00e7on]] (who named the flower ''[[Bougainvillea]]'') and his valet. The ship's surgeon later revealed this person as [[Jeanne Bar\u00e9]], possibly Commer\u00e7on's mistress; she would become the first woman known to circumnavigate the globe. Other notable people on this expedition were Count [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup de la P\u00e9rouse]] (member of the crew); the astronomer [[Pierre-Antoine Veron]]; the surgeon of ''Boudeuse'' Dr. Louis-Claude Laporte; the surgeon of the ''\u00c9toile'' Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Vives; the engineer and cartographer aboard the \u00c9toile Charles Routier de Romainville; and the writer and historian Louis-Antoine Starot de Saint-Germain.<ref name=\"Expedition\" />\n\n====Tahiti====\n[[File:Bougainville at Tahiti.png|thumb|Bougainville reaching Tahiti]]\nHe saw islands of the [[Tuamotu]] group on the following 22 March, on 2 April saw the peak of [[Mehetia]] and visited the island of [[Tahiti|Otaheite]] shortly after. He narrowly missed becoming their discoverer; a previous visit and claim had been made by British explorer [[Samuel Wallis]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']] less than a year previously. Bougainville claimed the island for France and named it ''New Cythera''.\n\nHis expedition left Tahiti and sailed westward to southern [[Samoa]] and the [[New Hebrides]], then on sighting [[Espiritu Santo]] turned west still looking for the ''Southern Continent''. On 4 June he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course to the north and east. He had almost found the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. He sailed through what is now known as the [[Solomon Islands]] but, because of the hostility of the people there, avoided landing. He named [[Bougainville Island]] for himself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The expedition was attacked by people from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] so the French expedition made for the [[Moluccas]]. At [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], they received news of [[Samuel Wallis|Wallis]] and [[Philip Carteret|Carteret]] who had preceded Bougainville in discovering Tahiti.\n\n====Return to France====\n[[File:Bougainville - Trait\u00e9 du calcul int\u00e9gral, 1754 - 162404.jpg|thumb|'' Trait\u00e9 du calcul int\u00e9gral'', 1754]]\n\nOn 16 March 1769 the expedition completed its circumnavigation and arrived at [[St Malo]]. It had lost only seven of its 340 crew, an extremely low level of casualties. This result was considered a credit to the enlightened management of the expedition by Bougainville.<ref name=\"Anne\">{{cite book|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520261143|pages=[https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/90 90,118\u2013119]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/90}}</ref>\n\nBougainville brought Ahutoru back to France, the first Tahitian to sail aboard a European vessel.  In France, Bougainville introduced the Tahitian to high society, including introducing him to the King and Queen at [[Versailles]].  Bougainville also underwrote part of the costs for Ahutoru's return to Tahiti after a two-year absence.  Unfortunately, Ahutoru died en route of [[smallpox]] in October 1771.<ref name=Anne/>{{rp|122\u2013123}}\n\n====''Voyage autour du monde''====\n[[File:Bougainville Voyage around the World 1772.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover page of the English edition of Bougainville's travelogue (1772).]]In 1771, Bougainville published his travel log from the expedition under the title ''Le voyage autour du monde, par la fr\u00e9gate ''La Boudeuse'', et la fl\u00fbte ''L'\u00c9toile (a.k.a. ''Voyage autour du monde'' and ''A Voyage Around the World''). The book describes the geography, biology and anthropology of [[Argentina]] (then a Spanish colony), [[Patagonia]], [[Tahiti]] and [[Indonesia]] (then a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] colony). The book was a sensation, especially the description of Tahitian society. Bougainville described it as an earthly paradise where men and women lived in blissful innocence, far from the corruption of civilisation.\n\nBougainville's descriptions powerfully expressed the concept of the [[noble savage]], influencing the [[utopian]] thoughts of philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] before the advent of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Denis Diderot]]'s book ''[[Suppl\u00e9ment au voyage de Bougainville]]'' retells the story of Bougainville's landing on Tahiti, narrated by an anonymous reader to one of his friends. Diderot used his fictional approach, including a description of the Tahitians as noble savages, to criticise Western ways of living and thinking.<ref name=Anne/>{{rp|117,121}}\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nAfter several years of absence, Bougainville again accepted a naval command. In 1777, he was captain of the [[74-gun]] [[French ship Bien-Aim\u00e9 (1769)|''Bien-Aim\u00e9'']].{{sfnp|Roche|2005|loc=volume 1|p=74}} He took part in the [[War of American Independence]], playing a crucial part in the French victory at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of the Saintes]], Bougainville commanded the 80-gun [[French ship Auguste (1778)|''Auguste'']]. He managed to rally eight ships of his own division, and bringing them safely into [[Sint Eustatius|Saint Eustace]] after the deafeat of [[Comte de Grasse]]. He was promoted to ''[[chef d'escadre]]''. When he re-entered the Army, he was commissioned as ''[[mar\u00e9chal de camp]]''.\n\nAfter [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] in 1783, Bougainville returned to Paris. He obtained the place of associate of the [[Acad\u00e9mie de Marine]]. He proposed a voyage of discovery to the [[North Pole]], but did not gain the support of the French government.\n\n===Promotion and retirement===\n\nIn 1787, he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He obtained the rank of vice-admiral in 1791.\n\nIn 1794, having escaped from the [[Reign of Terror]], he retired to his estate in [[Normandy]]. Returning to Paris, he was one of the founding members of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]]. In 1799, the Consul [[Napoleon]] made him a senator. He died in Paris on 31 August 1811.\n\n==Legacy and honours==\n*[[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]'s name is given to the largest eastern island of [[Papua New Guinea]]; and to the [[Bougainville Strait|strait]] which divides it from the island of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]]. It is also applied to the strait between [[Mallicollo]] and [[Espiritu Santo]] islands of the [[New Hebrides]] group. In the Falklands, [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]], and \"[[Lively Island|Isla Bougainville]]\" (Lively Island's Spanish name) commemorate him.\n*The genus of South American climbing shrubs with colourful bracts, ''[[Bougainvillea]]'', is named after him.\n*1804, he was made a Grand Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1804. \n*1808, Napoleon gave him the title of count (the Comte de Bougainville).\n*Thirteen ships of the [[French Navy]] have been named in his honour, see [[French ship Bougainville|French ship ''Bougainville'']].\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Legacy\n|align=center\n|File:Tomb of Bougainville at the Pantheon.jpg|Tomb of Louis Antoine de Bougainville, at the [[Panth\u00e9on]].\n|Image:Hyacinthe de Bougainville.jpg|[[Hyacinthe de Bougainville]], also a sailor and [[circumnavigator]], was the son of Louis Antoine de Bougainville.\n|File:Bougainville-IMG 8774-black.jpg|Posthumous bust of Bougainville, made in 1831 by [[Bosio Astyanax Scevola]].\n}}\n\n\n==Notes and references==\n[[File:2016-01 Hotel de la Marine 13.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Bougainville at [[H\u00f4tel de la Marine]] (Paris).]]\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|first=Jean-Michel|last=Roche|year=2005|title=Dictionnaire des b\u00e2timents de la flotte de guerre fran\u00e7aise de Colbert \u00e0 nos jours|isbn=978-2-9525917-0-6|oclc=165892922|publisher=Group Retozel-Maury Millau|volume=1|pages=74}}\n* {{cite book|last=Waggaman|first=B\u00e9atrice \u00c9lisabeth|title=Le Voyage autour du monde de Bougainville: droit et imaginaire.|location=Nancy|publisher=Presses universitaires de Nancy|year=1992}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cave|first=Alfred A.|title=The French and Indian Wa|location=New York|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2004}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dunmore|first=John|title=Storms and Dreams: The Life of Louis de Bougainville|location=Fairbanks|publisher=University of Alaska Press|year=2007}}{{ISBN|9781602230019}}.\n* {{cite book|title=Louis-Antoine de Bougainville.\" French and Indian War|year=2003|publisher=HighBeam Research|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114212500/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3411000024.html}}\n\n'''External links '''\n{{EB1911 poster|Bougainville, Louis Antoine de|Louis Antoine de Bougainville}}\n{{Wikisourcelang|fr|Voyage autour du monde|Voyage autour du monde}}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Bougainville,+Louis-Antoine+de,+comte}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Louis Antoine de Bougainville}}\n* [https://archive.org/download/VoyageAroundTheWorldByLewisDeBougainville1766-9/Bougainville_Voyage_Eng_Transcr_JFF.pdf Louis Antoine de Bougainville: \"Voyage around the world 1766\u20131769\", London 1772 (A transcription of the translation of \"Le voyage autour du monde, par la fr\u00e9gate La Boudeuse, et la fl\u00fbte L'\u00c9toile\" into English by John Reinhold Forster)]\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2284 Biography at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']\n*[http://1759.ccbn-nbc.gc.ca/ From the Warpath to the Plains of Abraham (Virtual exhibition)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080708144045/http://pages.quicksilver.net.nz/jcr/~boug1.html Louis-Antoine de Bougainville: Eighteenth Century French Sailor, Soldier, Statesman, Mathematician and leader of a Voyage around the world]\n* [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica] Digital Version Plates\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.litteratureaudio.com/livre-audio-gratuit-mp3/louis-antoine-de-bougainville-voyage-autour-du-monde.html/ Voyage autour du monde, audio version] [[Image:Speaker Icon.svg|20px]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bougainville, Louis Antoine}}\n[[Category:1729 births]]\n[[Category:1811 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at the Panth\u00e9on, Paris]]\n[[Category:Circumnavigators of the globe]]\n[[Category:Counts of the First French Empire]]\n[[Category:Grand Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]\n[[Category:Members of the S\u00e9nat conservateur]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:French explorers]]\n[[Category:French explorers of the Pacific]]\n[[Category:French Navy admirals]]\n[[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:People of New France]]\n[[Category:French people of the French and Indian War]]\n[[Category:Explorers of Chile]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Paris]]\n", "name_user": "Rama", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Antoine_de_Bougainville"}
