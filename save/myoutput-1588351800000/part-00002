This can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up.  Intended to make one's testicles permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the male genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if over-tightened.\n\nWhile leather stretchers are most common, other models consist of an assortment of steel rings that fastens with screws, causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer's testicles. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4&nbsp;inches.<ref name=\"Hartley2006\">{{Cite book\n | last1 = Hartley\n | first1 = Nina\n | year = 2006\n | title = Nina Hartley's Guide to Total Sex\n | last2 = Levine\n | first2 = I.

How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. A ball crusher is often combined with [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], either with a partner or by oneself.\n\n===Parachute===\nA '''parachute''' is a small [[Collar (BDSM)|collar]], usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. It is [[cone (geometry)|conical]] in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached.\n\nUsed as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM [[intimate relationship|relationship]], the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. Moderate weights of 3&ndash;5&nbsp;kg can be suspended, especially during [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], though occasionally much heavier weights are used. Smaller weights can be used when the male wearing it is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===Humbler===\n[[File:Humbler.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Man with humbler]]\nA '''humbler''' is a BDSM [[physical restraint]] device used to restrict the movement of a [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] male participant in a BDSM scene.\n\nThe humbler consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing anything from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.\n\n===Testicle cuffs===\nA '''testicle cuff''' is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it.  A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia.  A standard [[padlock]] may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.\n\nSome passive men enjoy the feeling of being \"owned\", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of \"owning\" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of [[Humiliation (BDSM)|humiliation]] involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetish]] of the wearer or his partner.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nHowever, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:\n\n* Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view.\n* Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being \"owned\", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes.\n* Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse.\n* Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the \"point of no return\". It is much harder to reach an orgasm.\n\n===Cock harness===\nA cock harness is a [[Sex toy#Penile toys|penile sex toy]] designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a [[cock ring]]. These devices are often associated with BDSM activities.

There is a level of [[Humiliation (BDSM)|humiliation]] involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetish]] of the wearer or his partner.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nHowever, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:\n\n* Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view.\n* Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being \"owned\", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes.\n* Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse.\n* Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the \"point of no return\". It is much harder to reach an orgasm.\n\n===Cock harness===\nA cock harness is a [[Sex toy#Penile toys|penile sex toy]] designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum.
