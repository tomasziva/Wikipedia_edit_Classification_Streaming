The competition ran from 16 May 2014 until Finals Day at [[Edgbaston]] on 23 August, which was won by [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Birmingham Bears]]. The competition replaced the [[Friends Life t20]] competition. With attendance figures over 700,000, it was the most attended season of T20 cricket in England since the format began in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/domestic-t20-crowds-break-700000-barrier |title=Domestic T20 crowds break 700,000 barrier |publisher=ecb.co.uk |access-date=16 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508141914/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/domestic-t20-crowds-break-700000-barrier |archive-date=8 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe 18 teams were divided into two groups of nine. In the style of a [[round-robin tournament]], each team played six other teams in their group both home and away. The other two teams were faced just once. The top four teams from each group qualified for the knockout stage: a three-round [[single-elimination tournament]]. The winner of each group had a home match in the quarter-finals against the fourth team from the other group. The runners-up from each group played at home against the third placed team from the other group. The semi-finals were a free draw from all the qualified teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/natwest-t20-blast-12766.pdf |title=NatWest T20 Blast |publisher=ECB |access-date=18 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505202229/http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/natwest-t20-blast-12766.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Finals Day will be again be held at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/county-schedule-2014-announced |title=County schedule for 2014 announced |publisher=ECB |access-date=1 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201092412/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/county-schedule-2014-announced |archive-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In the style of a [[round-robin tournament]], each team played six other teams in their group both home and away. The other two teams were faced just once.

The winner of each group had a home match in the quarter-finals against the fourth team from the other group. The runners-up from each group played at home against the third placed team from the other group.
