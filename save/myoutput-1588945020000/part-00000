In the second leg staged in Buenos Aires, Australia's [[Alex Tobin]] scored an unfortunate own goal in the 59th&nbsp;minute when he tried to block a cross from out wide. The cross deflected off Tobin and looped over the keeper and into the far side of the net. This proved to be the only goal of the game as Argentina won 1\u20130 for a 2\u20131 aggregate victory. Australia were eliminated.<ref name=\"smh-inhunt\">{{cite news | url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news931101_0105_5823 | title=Honours even as Socceroos stay in hunt | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=1 November 1993 | accessdate=9 June 2016 | author=Cockerill, Michael}}</ref><ref name=\"smh-lose\">{{cite news | url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news931119_0119_4154 | title=Own goal and Maradona reduce Socceroos to tears | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=19 November 1993 | accessdate=9 June 2016 | author=Cockerill, Michael}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{1994 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\n{{Canada men's national soccer team}}\n{{Australia national soccer team matches}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF-OFC play-off)}}\n[[Category:1993 in Australian soccer]]\n[[Category:1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|Play]]\n[[Category:1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)|P1]]\n[[Category:Australia national soccer team matches|World Cup 1994]]\n[[Category:Canada men's national soccer team matches|World Cup 1994]]\n[[Category:1993 in Canadian soccer|World]]\n[[Category:Soccer in Sydney]]\n[[Category:FIFA World Cup qualification inter-confederation play-offs]]\n[[Category:1994 FIFA World Cup qualification|play-off]]\n[[Category:July 1993 sports events in Canada]]\n[[Category:August 1993 sports events in Oceania]]\n[[Category:International association football competitions hosted by Australia]]\n[[Category:International association football competitions hosted by Canada]]\n[[Category:1993 in Alberta]]\n[[Category:1990s in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Edmonton]]\n[[Category:1990s in Edmonton]]\n[[Category:Association football penalty shoot-outs|FIFA World Cup qualification 1994]]\n", "name_user": "HawkAussie", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSecond leg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(CONCACAF%E2%80%93OFC_play-off)"}
