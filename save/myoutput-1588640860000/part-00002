Gore Sr. did not plan for his son to end up playing football, remarking: ''\"Whatever he wants to do, he\u2019s going to do it; not because I played ball, he has to play ball. Me seeing him when he was a little kid playing outside with his bigger cousins, I knew he was going to play football. But if he doesn\u2019t want to play, as long as he gets his grades and does something positive with his life, I\u2019m okay with it.\"'' Due to his NFL career, Frank Gore Sr. was unable to see his son play in local football games past the age of 5 until his return to Miami 13 years later when he signed with the [[Miami Dolphins]].

Gore Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and plays [[running back]]. Gore Sr. did not plan for his son to end up playing football, remarking: ''\"Whatever he wants to do, he\u2019s going to do it; not because I played ball, he has to play ball. Me seeing him when he was a little kid playing outside with his bigger cousins, I knew he was going to play football. But if he doesn\u2019t want to play, as long as he gets his grades and does something positive with his life, I\u2019m okay with it.\"'' Due to his NFL career, Frank Gore Sr. was unable to see his son play in local football games past the age of 5 until his return to Miami 13 years later when he signed with the [[Miami Dolphins]].
