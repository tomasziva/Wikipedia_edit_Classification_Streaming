The only formation preceding it in these territories was [[Samo's Empire]] known from between 631 and 658 AD. Great Moravia was thus the first joint state of the Slavic tribes that became later known as [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] and that later formed [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nIts core territory is the region now called Moravia in the eastern part of the Czech Republic alongside the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], which gave its name to the kingdom. The kingdom saw the rise of the first ever Slavic literary culture in the [[Old Church Slavonic language]] as well as the expansion of Christianity after the arrival of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]] in 863 and the creation of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet dedicated to a Slavic language. Glagolitic was subsequently replaced by a simpler Cyrillic. The Cyrillo-Methodian cultural mission had significant impact on most Slavic languages and stood at the beginning of the modern [[Cyrillic alphabet]].\n\nMoravia reached its largest territorial extent under the earl [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]] (Svatopluk in Czech), who ruled from 870 to 894. Although the borders of his empire cannot be exactly determined, he controlled the core territories of [[Moravia]] as well as other neighbouring regions, including [[Bohemia]], most of [[Slovakia]] and parts of [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], for some periods of his reign. Separatism and internal conflicts emerging after Sv\u00e4topluk's death contributed to the fall of Great Moravia, which was overrun by the [[Hungarians]] who then included the territory of present-day Slovakia in their domains. The exact date of Moravia's collapse is unknown, but it occurred between 902 and 907.\n\nMoravia experienced significant cultural development under King [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], with the arrival in 863 of the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]]. After his request for missionaries had been refused in Rome, Rastislav asked the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor to send a \"teacher\" (u\u010dite\u013e) to introduce literacy and a legal system (prav\u044cda) to Great Moravia. The request was granted. The missionary brothers Cyril and Methodius introduced a system of writing (the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]) and Slavonic liturgy, the latter eventually formally approved by [[Pope Adrian II]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Elvins|first=Mark Twinham|title=Towards a People's Liturgy: The Importance of Language|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ_U42D-I-EC|isbn=9780852442579}}</ref>  The Glagolitic script was probably invented by Cyril himself and the language he used for his translations of holy scripts and his original literary creation was based on the Slavic dialect he and his brother Methodius knew from their native [[Thessaloniki]]. The language, termed [[Old Church Slavonic]], was the direct ancestral language for [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and therefore also referred to as Old Bulgarian. Old Church Slavonic, therefore, differed somewhat from the local Slavic dialect of Great Moravia which was the ancestral idiom to the later dialects spoken in Moravia and western Slovakia.\n\nLater, the disciples of Cyril and Methodius were expelled from Great Moravia by King [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]], who re-orientated the Empire to Western Christianity. Nevertheless, the expulsion had a significant impact on countries where the disciples settled and from there continued their evangelizing missions - especially [[Southeastern Europe]], firstly [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], and later [[Eastern Europe]]. Arriving in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the disciples continued the Cyrilo-Methodian mission and the [[Glagolitic script]] was substituted by [[Cyrillic]] which used some of its letters. [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] was developed during the 9th century AD at the [[Preslav Literary School]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Francis | last=Dvornik |title=The Slavs: Their Early History and Civilization | quote = The Psalter and the Book of Prophets were adapted or \"modernized\" with special regard to their use in Bulgarian churches, and it was in this school that glagolitic writing was replaced by the so-called Cyrillic writing, which was more akin to the Greek uncial, simplified matters considerably and is still used by the Orthodox Slavs. | year=1956 |place=Boston | publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |page=179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt |url-access=registration |quote=Cyrillic preslav. |title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500\u20131250|series=Cambridge Medieval Textbooks|author= Florin Curta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0521815390|pages= [https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt/page/221 221]\u2013222}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-H9BTVHKRMC&pg=PR3-IA34&lpg=PR3-IA34&dq=The+Orthodox+Church+in+the+Byzantine+Empire+Cyrillic+preslav+eastern#v=onepage&q=%20preslav%20eastern&f=false|chapter= The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire|title=Oxford History of the Christian Church|author= J.

The ending -ava, as in many other Czech and Slovak rivers, is most often regarded as Slavicization of the originally Germanic -ahwa (= modern German \"Au\" or \"-a\"), cognate to Latin aqua. Some scholars again link it, via Celtic -ab, to [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] PIE ''*apa''/''*opa'' (\u201ewater, sea\u201c),<ref name=\"zj\u010d\">{{Cite \n  | last = Lutterer\n  | first = Ivan\n  | last2 = Majt\u00e1n\n  | first2 = Ivan\n  | last3 = \u0160r\u00e1mek\n  | first3 = Rudolf\n  | title = Zem\u011bpisn\u00e1 jm\u00e9na \u010ceskoslovenska.

The root mor- might be also connected with other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] words with the meaning of water, lake or sea (sea: Slavic more, Latin mare, Welsh m\u00f4r, German Meer; humidity: English and German Moor, Slavic mokr-). Compare also other river names like Mur in Austria and another [[Great Morava|Morava]] in Serbia, etc.). \n\n==Territory==\n\nAfter the fall of Great Moravia, its central territory was gradually divided between the newly ascending [[Czech Kingdom]] (Bohemia) and [[Hungarian Kingdom]], separating the Czech and Slovak territories for another thousand years. The frontier was originally settled on the Morava river (the Czech Kingdom to its west and Hungary, now Slovakia, to its east). However, from the 12th century, the Czech kings managed to gain more and more of the region on the eastern bank, eventually gaining the whole stretch of the eastern territory from Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b down to Str\u00e1\u017enice along the White Carpathians. The original core territory of Great Moravia, nowadays forming the eastern part of Moravia and situated between the White Carpathians and the Ch\u0159iby mountains, has retained its non-Czech identity in its designation \"Slov\u00e1cko\" which shows common origins with the name of the neighbouring Slovakia - a token of a past shared identity in Great Moravian times. This core region of Great Moravia along the river has retained a unique culture with a rich folklore tradition: the above-mentioned Slov\u00e1cko stretches, to the south (where the Morava river forms the Czech-Slovak frontier), into two regions - the Z\u00e1lu\u017e\u00ed region on the Morava\u00b4s western (Czech) bank and Z\u00e1horie on its eastern (Slovak) bank. Z\u00e1horie also boasts the only surviving building from Great Moravian times, the chapel at [[Kop\u010dany]] just across the Morava from the archaeological site of [[Mikul\u010dice]] (these two important Great Moravian places are now connected by a bridge). The core of Great Moravia was extended, according to legend, in the early 830s, when [[Mojmir I of Moravia]] crossed the Morava and conquered the neighbouring principality of Nitra (present-day western Slovakia). The former principality of Nitra was used as what is termed in Slovak ''\u00fadeln\u00e9 knie\u017eatsvo'', or the territory given to and ruled by the successor to the throne, traditionally the ruling k\u044anendz\u044c (Prince)\u00b4s sister\u00b4s son.\n\nNevertheless, the extent, and even the very location of Great Moravia ([[historiography|historiographical]] terms, as its original formal name is unknown) are a subject of debate.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=293}} Rival theories place its centre south of the Danube (the Morava in Serbia) or on the Great Hungarian Plain.{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=402}} The exact date when the Moravian state was founded is also disputed, but it probably occurred in the early 830s under Prince Mojm\u00edr I (r. 820s/830s\u2013846), the first known ruler of the united Moravia. Mojm\u00edr and his successor, [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] (\"Rostislav\" in Czech), who ruled from 846 to 870, initially acknowledged the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] monarchs, but the Moravian fight for independence caused a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]] from the 840s.\n\n=== Traditional view ===\n\nAccording to most historians, the core territories of Moravia were located in the valley of the river [[Morava (river)|Morava]] in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia.{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2009|p = 261}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp = 126-128}} Archaeological findings of large early medieval fortresses and the significant cluster of settlements growing around them suggest that an important centre of power emerged in this region in the 9th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 130}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p = 109}} Early sources ([[Alfred the Great]]'s contemporaneous translation of [[Orosius]]'s ''History of the World'', which mentioned Moravia's neighbours, and the description of the travel of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine and Methodius]] from Moravia to Venice through Pannonia in the ''Life of Constantine'') also substantiate the traditional view.{{sfn|Betti|2013|pp=144-145}}\n\n{{Quote|These Maroara have to the west of them the Thyringas and some Behemas and half the Begware, and south them on the other side of the Danube river is the land Carendre extending south as far as the mountains called the Alps.&nbsp;...&nbsp;To the east of the land Carendre, beyond the uninhabited district, is the land of the Pulgare, and east of that is the land of Greeks.

of accurate contemporaneous sources.{{sfn|Kirschbaum|2005|p=35}}{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2012|p=11}} For instance, the monks writing the ''Annals of Fulda'' in the 9th&nbsp;century obviously had limited knowledge of the geography of distant regions of Central Europe.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=128}} Furthermore, Moravian monarchs adopted an expansionist policy in the 830s, thus the borders of their realm often changed.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=109-110}}\n\nMoravia reached the peak of its territorial expansion under Svatopluk I (r. 870\u2013894).{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=110}} [[Lesser Poland]], [[Pannonia]], and other regions were forced to accept, at least formally and often only for a short period, his suzerainty.{{sfn|Poul\u00edk|1978|p=160}}{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2012|p = 11}} On the other hand, the existence of the archaeologically attested shared cultural zones between Moravia, Lesser Poland and [[Silesia]] do not prove that the northern boundaries of Moravia were located over these territories.{{sfn|Berend|Urbanczyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=89}} According to archaeologist B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s Sz\u0151ke, the [[Principality of Lower Pannonia|comitatus of Mosaburg]] in Pannonia was never part of Moravia.{{sfn|Sz\u0151ke|2007|p=412}} Neither archaeological finds nor written sources substantiate the traditional view of the permanent annexation of huge territories in his reign.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=110}} Other scholars warn that it's a mistake to draw the boundaries of core territories because Moravia did not reach that development level.{{sfn|Berend|Urbanczyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=59}}\n\n=== Further theories ===\n{{Main|Alternative theories of the location of Great Moravia}}\n\nIn 1784, Slovak historian [[Juraj Sklen\u00e1r]] disputed the traditional view on the location of Moravia and placed its core region in the region of [[Sirmium]] (now Sremska Mitrovica in [[Serbia]]), stating that it spread from that location to the north to present-day Slovakia, Moravia and Bohemia.{{sfn|Marsina|2000|p=156}} Similarly, in the 1820s, Friedrich Blumenerger placed Great Moravia to the south on the borders of Pannonia and Moesia.{{sfn|Marsina|2000|p=157}} Their views remained isolated until the 1970s,{{sfn|Marsina|2000|p=157}} when Imre Boba again published a theory that Moravia's core territory must have been located around Sirmium, near the river [[Great Morava]].{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|pp = 312-313}}{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2009|p = 261-262}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp = 126, 128-129}} P\u00e9ter P\u00fcsp\u00f6ki-Nagy proposed the existence of two Moravias: a \"Great\" Moravia at the southern Morava river in present-day [[Serbia]], and another Moravia on the northern Morava river in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia.{{sfn|P\u00fcsp\u00f6ki-Nagy|1978|pp = 60-82}} A similar theory was also published by Toru Senga.{{sfn|Senga|1983|pp = 307-345}} In the 1990s, the southern thesis was further developed by Charles Bowlus, who wrote that Moravia emerged in the region of the \"confluences of the [[Drava]], [[Sava]], [[Drina]], [[Tisza]], and southern [[Great Morava|Morava]] rivers with the [[Danube]]\".{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p = 32}} Bowlus emphasized that the orientation of the Frankish marcher organization was focused on the southeast territories, which also supports Great Moravia's southern position.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=293}} Martin Eggers suggested the original location of Moravia was centered around modern [[Banat]] at the confluence of the rivers Tisza and [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]].{{sfn|Bowlus|2009|p = 313}}{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2009|p = 262}} with further expansions extending to the territories in present-day [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].\n\n==History==\n{{History of the Czech Republic}}\n{{History of Slovakia}}\n\n===Origins (before c. 800)===\n\nThe earliest possible reference to Slavic tribes living in the valley of the northern Morava river was made by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Procopius]].{{sfn|Bartl|\u010ci\u010daj|Koh\u00fatova|Letz|2002|p=18}} He wrote of a group of [[Germanic

hand-made ceramics,{{sfn|Spiesz|Caplovic|2006|p=17}} and closely analogous objects in southern [[Poland]] and western [[Ukraine]] appeared at the confluence of the northern Morava River and the [[Middle Danube]], dated to around 550.{{sfn|Barford|2001|pp=53, 63-64}}\n\nLarge territories in the [[Pannonian Basin]] were conquered after 568 by the nomadic [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] who had arrived from the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s.{{sfn|Bartl|\u010ci\u010daj|Koh\u00fatova|Letz|2002|p=18}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp = xii, 62-63}} The Slavs were forced to pay tribute to the Avars and to participate

Danube river in the early period of the khaganate (southern border of present-day Slovakia), a smaller (southernmost) part came under their direct military control after the fall of Samo's empire.{{sfn|Z\u00e1bojn\u00edk|2009}}{{sfn|Oder|2012|p=60}}{{sfn|Galu\u0161ka|1991|p=21}}{{efn|The occurrence of the biritual cemeteries from the middle and late Avar period is limited to the line

180 known localities).

The second element of the army  (''pohotovos\u0165'') consisted of lower classes of free citizens who were not, in most cases, professional warriors. However, thanks to their large numbers and knowledge of the prevalent types of weapons they represented a serious military force. They played a decisive role mainly in the defence of Great Moravian territory; their participation in wars of expansion was less common.{{sfn|Ruttkay|1997|p=181}} The army was led by the prince or, in his absence, by a commander-in-chief called a ''[[voivode]]''.<ref name=\"centreandperiphery\">{{Cite book| first=Lubom\u00edr E. | last=Havl\u00edk| contribution=Great Moravia between the Franconians, Byzantium and Rome| title=Centre and Periphery: Comparative Studies in Archaeology| editor-first=T.| editor-last=Champion| publisher=Routledge| place=London, Boston| pages=227\u2013237| year=1989 | contribution-url=}}</ref>  The maximum size of the army is estimated at 20,000-30,000 men.{{sfn|Ruttkay|1997|p=181}}  In case of external aggression, ordinary people participated in defence and diversion actions. An important element of the defence of Great Moravia was a system of strong fortifications, which were difficult to besiege with the then prevailing forms of military organization. For example, a Frankish chronicler wrote with awe about the size of Rastislav's fortress (''\"firmissimum, ut feritur, vallum\"'').{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=245}}\n\nThe typical weapon of a West Slavic foot soldier was an axe of a specific shape, called a ''bradatica''. Spears were universally used by both infantry and cavalry. The weapons associated with a nomadic (Avar) culture, like [[sabre]]s, [[reflexion bow]]s and specific types of spears are missing. On the other hand, a military equipment became more influenced by western types and new types of weapons like double-edged swords (rare before the 9th century) became popular. Archers, unlike the previous period, were already a part of the infantry.{{sfn|Ruttkay|1997|p=184}}\n\n===Aristocracy===\nThe existence of a local aristocracy is well documented: contemporaneous sources refer to \"leading men\"<ref>''The Annals of Fulda'' (years 864 and 901), pp. 51., 142.</ref> (''optimates'' or ''primates''),{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|pp=140, 248}} and ''nobiles viri'' or ''principes''.{{sfn|\u0160tefan|2011|p=334}} However, these documents do not reveal the basis of the Moravian chiefs' power.{{sfn|\u0160tefan|2011|p=334}} Richly furnished graves{{spaced ndash}}with the exception of the one at Blatnica, which is \"an old and disputable find\",{{sfn|\u0160tefan|2011|p=335}} according to \u0160tefan{{spaced ndash}}have only been unearthed in Mikul\u010dice and other large fortifications controlled by the monarchs.{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2012|p=13}} \u0160tefan writes that the concentration of prestige goods in the towns shows that \"immediate contact with the sovereign, who certainly travelled between the centres, was apparently the best winning strategy for the top elite\".{{sfn|\u0160tefan|2011|p=335}} On the other hand, the ''optimates'' had an important role in the government: the monarchs did not make important decisions without discussing them in a council formed by the Moravian \"dukes\".{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Havl\u00edk|2004|p=233}}\n\n===Population===\n{{Undue weight section|date=November 2015}}\nArchaeological research indicates that the Moravian population had ties to [[Iran]]ian and [[Middle-Eastern]] territories.{{sfn|Champion|1995|p=232}} The ornaments and motifs of the jewelry originated in the [[Near East]], and similarities were found in Syria, Egypt and Iran.{{sfn|Champion|1995|p=232}} Footwear was similar to the boots of [[Tabaristan]].{{sfn|Champion|1995|p=232}} Their buttons were of Caucasian and Iranian types.{{sfn|Champion|1995|p=232}} The style of their abodes and types of domesticated animals, like horses, cattle and goats, were Middle Asian.{{sfn|Champion|1995|p=232}} The Moravian (glagolitic) script also carried eastern features.

At first, researchers assumed it to be limited to simple wooden churches like those known from the German environment in dating from the 7th-8th century.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=40}} These wooden churches were suitable for initial missionary activities due to the easy availability of materials, quick construction and no need for consecration.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=40}}  This opinion was refined in 1949 after excavations in [[Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto (Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b District)|Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto]].

The exact dating is a goal of ongoing research based on radiocarbon analysis and dendrochronology.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=61}}\n\nGreat Moravian sacral architecture is represented by a rich variety of types, from three-nave basilicas (Mikul\u010dice III, Bratislava), triconcha (Dev\u00edn), simple rotunda without apses (Mikul\u010dice VII), two-apses rotunda (Mikul\u010dice VI), tetraconchic rotunda (Mikul\u010dice IX) and a whole group of one-nave churches and rotundas with one apse. The largest number of churches has been found in south-eastern Moravia. Mikul\u010dice, with 12 churches, clearly dominates among all other localities with the first stone churches built around 800<ref name=\"poulik\"/> (a potential 13th church is [[Kop\u010dany]], on the Slovak side of the border). The three-nave [[basilica]] from Mikul\u010dice, which has interior dimensions of 35&nbsp;m by 9&nbsp;m and a separate [[baptistery]], is the largest sacral building found to date.<ref name='bm'/><ref name='worldarcheology'/> The high concentration of churches in Mikulul\u010dice exceeded the needs of the local population, and so are believed to be proprietary churches (''Eigenkirchen''), known also in Francia.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=61}} Large churches were also important ecclesiastical centres. The current dating of several churches precedes the Byzantine mission. The churches were decorated mostly by frescoes, but usage of [[Fresco-secco|secco]] is also documented.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=44}} The authors were probably foreign artists from Francia and northern Italy{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=44}} (the latter indicated by, for example, the chemical composition of paintings in Bratislava and Dev\u00edn{{sfn|\u0160tefanovi\u010dov\u00e1|1989|p=119}}).\n\nGreat Moravian sacral architecture was probably influenced by Frankish, Dalmatian-Istrian, Byzantine, and classical architecture, which also indicated complex missionary activities. Two open-air museums, in Modr\u00e1 near [[Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b]] and in Ducov\u00e9, are devoted to Great Moravian architecture.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Slavic mythology|History of Christianity in Slovakia|Christianization of Moravia}}\n[[File:Mikul\u010dice-Valy 4.JPG|thumb|Stone foundations of a church in Valy u Mikul\u010dic, [[Czech Republic]]]]\nLike other Slavs, the Great Moravian Slavs originally practised a polytheistic religion with an ancestor cult. Several cult places used prior to the [[Christianization of Moravia]] have been found in Moravia (Mikul\u010dice and [[B\u0159eclav#Pohansko|Pohansko]]).

[[Old Church Slavonic]] became the fourth liturgical language of the Christian world. However, after Methodius's death (885) all his followers were expelled from Great Moravia; accordingly, the use of Slavic liturgy in Great Moravia lasted only about 22 years.<ref>Milan Strhan, David P.

Cyril also invented the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], suitable for Slavic languages, and first translated the Bible into a Slavic language, along with Methodius, who later completed the project.\n\nMethodius wrote the first Slavic legal code, combining local [[custom (law)|customary law]] with advanced [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Byzantine law]]. Similarly, the Great Moravian criminal law code was not merely a translation from Latin, but also punished a number of offenses originally tolerated by pre-Christian Slavic mores, yet prohibited by Christianity (mostly related to sexual conduct).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The [[canon law]] was simply adopted from Byzantine sources.\n\nThere are not many literary works that can be unambiguously identified as originally written in Great Moravia. One of them is ''[[Proglas]]'', a cultivated poem in which Cyril defends the Slavic liturgy. ''Vita Cyrilli'' (attributed to [[Clement of Ohrid]]) and ''Vita Methodii'' (probably written by Methodius' successor [[Gorazd]]) are biographies with valuable information about Great Moravia under Rastislav and Sv\u00e4topluk I.\n\nThe brothers also founded an academy, initially led by Methodius, which produced hundreds of Slavic clerics. A well-educated class was essential for administration of all early-feudal states and Great Moravia was no exception. ''Vita Methodii'' mentions that the bishop of Nitra served as Sv\u00e4topluk I's chancellor, and even Prince [[Koce\u013e]] of the [[Balaton Principality]] was said to have mastered the Glagolitic script.<ref name=\"methodii\"/> The location of the Great Moravian academy has not been identified, but possible sites include Mikul\u010dice (where some [[stylus|styli]] have been found in an ecclesiastical building), Dev\u00edn Castle (with a building identified as a probable school), and Nitra (with its Episcopal basilica and monastery). When Methodius\u2019 disciples were expelled from Great Moravia by Sv\u00e4topluk I in 885, they disseminated their knowledge (including the Glagolitic script) to other Slavic countries, such as [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], and Bohemia. They created the [[Cyrillic script]], which became the standard alphabet in the [[Kievan Rus']] (modern day Russia, Ukraine and Belarus). The Great Moravian cultural heritage survived in Bulgarian seminaries, paving the way for the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']].\n\n===Arts===\n[[File:K\u0159\u00ed\u017e z Mikul\u010dic.png|thumb|right|A silver cross from Mikul\u010dice.]]\nIn the first half of the 9th century, Great Moravian craftsmen were inspired by contemporary Carolingian art.<ref name='worldarcheology'/> In the second half of the 9th century, Great Moravian jewelry was influenced by Byzantine, Eastern Mediterranean, and Adriatic styles.<ref name='worldarcheology'/> However, in the words of Czech archaeologist Josef Poul\u00edk, \"these new forms and techniques were not copied passively, but were transformed in the local idiom, establishing in this way the roots of the distinctive Great Moravian jewellery style.\"<ref name='worldarcheology'/> Typical Great Moravian jewelry included silver and golden earrings decorated by fine granular filigree, as well as silver and gilded bronze buttons covered by foliate ornaments.<ref name='bm'/>\n\n==Legacy==\nGreat Moravian centres (''e.g.'', Bratislava (Pozsony, Pressburg), Nitra (Nyitra), [[Tekov|Tekov (Bars)]], and [[Zempl\u00edn (region)|Zempl\u00edn]] (Zempl\u00e9n)) retained their functions after the fall of Great Moravia, although the identification of Bratislava, Tekov and Zempl\u00edn as Great Moravian castles is not generally accepted.<ref>{{Harvnb |Krist\u00f3|1994| pp=84, 553, 743}}</ref>{{clarify | date = September 2015 | reason = How to explain the origin of Great Moravian basilica on Bratislava castle, cemetery, GM fortification, etc?}} Several sources suggest that Hungarian rulers followed the contemporary German or Bulgar patents when they established the new administrative system in their kingdom, or they introduced a new system.<ref name=\"Krist\u00f3 1988 21-100\">{{Harvnb |Krist\u00f3|1988|pp=21\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nSocial differentiation in Great Moravia reached the state of early [[feudalism]], creating the social basis for development of later medieval states in the region.<ref name=\"kucera\">{{Cite book| last =Ku\u010dera| first =Mat\u00fa\u0161| author-link =| title =Slovensko po p\u00e1de Ve\u013ekej Moravy| publisher =Veda| year =1974| location =Bratislava}}</ref> The question what happened to Great Moravian noble families after 907 is still under debate.

The only formation preceding it in these territories was [[Samo's Empire]] known from between 631 and 658 AD. Great Moravia was thus the first joint state of the Slavic tribes that became later known as [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] and that later formed [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nIts core territory is the region now called Moravia in the eastern part of Czechia alongside the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], which gave its name to the kingdom. The kingdom saw the rise of the first ever Slavic literary culture in the [[Old Church Slavonic language]] as well as the expansion of Christianity after the arrival of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]] in 863 and the creation of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet dedicated to a Slavic language. Glagolitic was subsequently replaced by a simpler Cyrillic. The Cyrillo-Methodian cultural mission had significant impact on most Slavic languages and stood at the beginning of the modern [[Cyrillic alphabet]].\n\nMoravia reached its largest territorial extent under the earl [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]] (Svatopluk in Czech), who ruled from 870 to 894. Although the borders of his empire cannot be exactly determined, he controlled the core territories of [[Moravia]] as well as other neighbouring regions, including [[Bohemia]], most of [[Slovakia]] and parts of [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], for some periods of his reign. Separatism and internal conflicts emerging after Sv\u00e4topluk's death contributed to the fall of Great Moravia, which was overrun by the [[Hungarians]] who then included the territory of present-day Slovakia in their domains. The exact date of Moravia's collapse is unknown, but it occurred between 902 and 907.\n\nMoravia experienced significant cultural development under King [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], with the arrival in 863 of the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]]. After his request for missionaries had been refused in Rome, Rastislav asked the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor to send a \"teacher\" (u\u010dite\u013e) to introduce literacy and a legal system (prav\u044cda) to Great Moravia. The request was granted. The missionary brothers Cyril and Methodius introduced a system of writing (the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]) and Slavonic liturgy, the latter eventually formally approved by [[Pope Adrian II]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Elvins|first=Mark Twinham|title=Towards a People's Liturgy: The Importance of Language|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJ_U42D-I-EC|isbn=9780852442579}}</ref>  The Glagolitic script was probably invented by Cyril himself and the language he used for his translations of holy scripts and his original literary creation was based on the Slavic dialect he and his brother Methodius knew from their native [[Thessaloniki]]. The language, termed [[Old Church Slavonic]], was the direct ancestral language for [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and therefore also referred to as Old Bulgarian. Old Church Slavonic, therefore, differed somewhat from the local Slavic dialect of Great Moravia which was the ancestral idiom to the later dialects spoken in Moravia and western Slovakia.\n\nLater, the disciples of Cyril and Methodius were expelled from Great Moravia by King [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]], who re-orientated the Empire to Western Christianity. Nevertheless, the expulsion had a significant impact on countries where the disciples settled and from there continued their evangelizing missions - especially [[Southeastern Europe]], firstly [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], and later [[Eastern Europe]]. Arriving in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the disciples continued the Cyrilo-Methodian mission and the [[Glagolitic script]] was substituted by [[Cyrillic]] which used some of its letters. [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] was developed during the 9th century AD at the [[Preslav Literary School]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Francis | last=Dvornik |title=The Slavs: Their Early History and Civilization | quote = The Psalter and the Book of Prophets were adapted or \"modernized\" with special regard to their use in Bulgarian churches, and it was in this school that glagolitic writing was replaced by the so-called Cyrillic writing, which was more akin to the Greek uncial, simplified matters considerably and is still used by the Orthodox Slavs. | year=1956 |place=Boston | publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |page=179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt |url-access=registration |quote=Cyrillic preslav. |title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500\u20131250|series=Cambridge Medieval Textbooks|author= Florin Curta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0521815390|pages= [https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt/page/221 221]\u2013222}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-H9BTVHKRMC&pg=PR3-IA34&lpg=PR3-IA34&dq=The+Orthodox+Church+in+the+Byzantine+Empire+Cyrillic+preslav+eastern#v=onepage&q=%20preslav%20eastern&f=false|chapter= The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire|title=Oxford History of the Christian Church|author= J.

The ending -ava, as in many other Czech and Slovak rivers, is most often regarded as Slavicization of the originally Germanic -ahwa (= modern German \"Au\" or \"-a\"), cognate to Latin aqua. Some scholars again link it, via Celtic -ab, to [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] PIE ''*apa''/''*opa'' (\u201ewater, sea\u201c),<ref name=\"zj\u010d\">{{Cite \n  | last = Lutterer\n  | first = Ivan\n  | last2 = Majt\u00e1n\n  | first2 = Ivan\n  | last3 = \u0160r\u00e1mek\n  | first3 = Rudolf\n  | title = Zem\u011bpisn\u00e1 jm\u00e9na \u010ceskoslovenska.

The root mor- might be also connected with other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] words with the meaning of water, lake or sea (sea: Slavic more, Latin mare, Welsh m\u00f4r, German Meer; humidity: English and German Moor, Slavic mokr-). Compare also other river names like Mur in Austria and another [[Great Morava|Morava]] in Serbia, etc.). \n\n==Territory==\n\nAfter the fall of Great Moravia, its central territory was gradually divided between the newly ascending [[Czech Kingdom]] (Bohemia) and [[Hungarian Kingdom]], separating the Czech and Slovak territories for another thousand years. The frontier was originally settled on the Morava river (the Czech Kingdom to its west and Hungary, now Slovakia, to its east). However, from the 12th century, the Czech kings managed to gain more and more of the region on the eastern bank, eventually gaining the whole stretch of the eastern territory from Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b down to Str\u00e1\u017enice along the White Carpathians. The original core territory of Great Moravia, nowadays forming the eastern part of Moravia and situated between the White Carpathians and the Ch\u0159iby mountains, has retained its non-Czech identity in its designation \"Slov\u00e1cko\" which shows common origins with the name of the neighbouring Slovakia - a token of a past shared identity in Great Moravian times. This core region of Great Moravia along the river has retained a unique culture with a rich folklore tradition: the above-mentioned Slov\u00e1cko stretches, to the south (where the Morava river forms the Czech-Slovak frontier), into two regions - the Z\u00e1lu\u017e\u00ed region on the Morava\u00b4s western (Czech) bank and Z\u00e1horie on its eastern (Slovak) bank. Z\u00e1horie also boasts the only surviving building from Great Moravian times, the chapel at [[Kop\u010dany]] just across the Morava from the archaeological site of [[Mikul\u010dice]] (these two important Great Moravian places are now connected by a bridge). The core of Great Moravia was extended, according to legend, in the early 830s, when [[Mojmir I of Moravia]] crossed the Morava and conquered the neighbouring principality of Nitra (present-day western Slovakia). The former principality of Nitra was used as what is termed in Slovak ''\u00fadeln\u00e9 knie\u017eatsvo'', or the territory given to and ruled by the successor to the throne, traditionally the ruling k\u044anendz\u044c (Prince)\u00b4s sister\u00b4s son.\n\nNevertheless, the extent, and even the very location of Great Moravia ([[historiography|historiographical]] terms, as its original formal name is unknown) are a subject of debate.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=293}} Rival theories place its centre south of the Danube (the Morava in Serbia) or on the Great Hungarian Plain.{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=402}} The exact date when the Moravian state was founded is also disputed, but it probably occurred in the early 830s under Prince Mojm\u00edr I (r. 820s/830s\u2013846), the first known ruler of the united Moravia. Mojm\u00edr and his successor, [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] (\"Rostislav\" in Czech), who ruled from 846 to 870, initially acknowledged the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] monarchs, but the Moravian fight for independence caused a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]] from the 840s.\n\n=== Traditional view ===\n\nAccording to most historians, the core territories of Moravia were located in the valley of the river [[Morava (river)|Morava]] in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia.{{sfn|Mach\u00e1\u010dek|2009|p = 261}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp = 126-128}} Archaeological findings of large early medieval fortresses and the significant cluster of settlements growing around them suggest that an important centre of power emerged in this region in the 9th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 130}}{{sfn|Barford|2001|p = 109}} Early sources ([[Alfred the Great]]'s contemporaneous translation of [[Orosius]]'s ''History of the World'', which mentioned Moravia's neighbours, and the description of the travel of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine and Methodius]] from Moravia to Venice through Pannonia in the ''Life of Constantine'') also substantiate the traditional view.{{sfn|Betti|2013|pp=144-145}}\n\n{{Quote|These Maroara have to the west of them the Thyringas and some Behemas and half the Begware, and south them on the other side of the Danube river is the land Carendre extending south as far as the mountains called the Alps.&nbsp;...&nbsp;To the east of the land Carendre, beyond the uninhabited district, is the land of the Pulgare, and east of that is the land of Greeks.

north to present-day Slovakia, Moravia and Bohemia.{{sfn|Marsina|2000|p=156}} Similarly, in the 1820s, Friedrich Blumenerger placed Great Moravia to the south on the borders of Pannonia and

Charles Bowlus, who wrote that Moravia emerged in the region of the \"confluences of the [[Drava]], [[Sava]], [[Drina]], [[Tisza]], and southern [[Great Morava|Morava]] rivers with the [[Danube]]\".{{sfn|Bowlus|1994|p = 32}} Bowlus emphasized that the orientation of the Frankish marcher organization was focused on the southeast territories, which also supports Great Moravia's southern position.{{sfn|Rogers|2010|p=293}} Martin Eggers suggested the original location of Moravia was centered around modern [[Banat]] at the confluence of the rivers Tisza and [[Mure\u0219

At first, researchers assumed it to be limited to simple wooden churches like those known from the German environment in dating from the 7th-8th century.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=40}} These wooden churches were suitable for initial missionary activities due to the easy availability of materials, quick construction and no need for consecration.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=40}}  This opinion was refined in 1949 after excavations in [[Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto (Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b District)|Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto]]. From the 1960s, stone churches have also been excavated in Slovakia. As of 2014, more than 25 sacral buildings have been safely identified in the core territory of Great Moravia (Moravia and Western Slovakia).{{sfn|Botek|2014b|p=8}} The remains of the first uncovered churches were only \"negatives\" (ditches filled with secondary material after removal of original foundations), but later research also uncovered remains of buildings with original foundations. Especially after the discovery of Great Moravian graves near the church in [[Kop\u010dany]], the potential Great Moravian origin of several still-standing churches in Slovakia (''viz.'', [[Kop\u010dany]], [[Nitrianska Blatnica]], [[Kosto\u013eany pod Tribe\u010dom]]) was once more an open question. The exact dating is a goal of ongoing research based on radiocarbon analysis and dendrochronology.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=61}}\n\nGreat Moravian sacral architecture is represented by a rich variety of types, from three-nave basilicas (Mikul\u010dice III, Bratislava), triconcha (Dev\u00edn), simple rotunda without apses (Mikul\u010dice VII), two-apses rotunda (Mikul\u010dice VI), tetraconchic rotunda (Mikul\u010dice IX) and a whole group of one-nave churches and rotundas with one apse. The largest number of churches has been found in south-eastern Moravia. Mikul\u010dice, with 12 churches, clearly dominates among all other localities with the first stone churches built around 800<ref name=\"poulik\"/> (a potential 13th church is [[Kop\u010dany]], on the Slovak side of the border). The three-nave [[basilica]] from Mikul\u010dice, which has interior dimensions of 35&nbsp;m by 9&nbsp;m and a separate [[baptistery]], is the largest sacral building found to date.<ref name='bm'/><ref name='worldarcheology'/> The high concentration of churches in Mikulul\u010dice exceeded the needs of the local population, and so are believed to be proprietary churches (''Eigenkirchen''), known also in Francia.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=61}} Large churches were also important ecclesiastical centres. The current dating of several churches precedes the Byzantine mission. The churches were decorated mostly by frescoes, but usage of [[Fresco-secco|secco]] is also documented.{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=44}} The authors were probably foreign artists from Francia and northern Italy{{sfn|Botek|2014a|p=44}} (the latter indicated by, for example, the chemical composition of paintings in Bratislava and Dev\u00edn{{sfn|\u0160tefanovi\u010dov\u00e1|1989|p=119}}).\n\nGreat Moravian sacral architecture was probably influenced by Frankish, Dalmatian-Istrian, Byzantine, and classical architecture, which also indicated complex missionary activities. Two open-air museums, in Modr\u00e1 near [[Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b]] and in Ducov\u00e9, are devoted to Great Moravian architecture.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Slavic mythology|History of Christianity in Slovakia|Christianization of Moravia}}\n[[File:Mikul\u010dice-Valy 4.JPG|thumb|Stone foundations of a church in Valy u Mikul\u010dic, [[Czech Republic]]]]\nLike other Slavs, the Great Moravian Slavs originally practised a polytheistic religion with an ancestor cult.

Cyril also invented the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], suitable for Slavic languages, and first translated the Bible into a Slavic language, along with Methodius, who later completed the project.\n\nMethodius wrote the first Slavic legal code, combining local [[custom (law)|customary law]] with advanced [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Byzantine law]]. Similarly, the Great Moravian criminal law code was not merely a translation from Latin, but also punished a number of offenses originally tolerated by pre-Christian Slavic mores, yet prohibited by Christianity (mostly related to sexual conduct).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The [[canon law]] was simply adopted from Byzantine sources.\n\nThere are not many literary works that can be unambiguously identified as originally written in Great Moravia. One of them is ''[[Proglas]]'', a cultivated poem in which Cyril defends the Slavic liturgy. ''Vita Cyrilli'' (attributed to [[Clement of Ohrid]]) and ''Vita Methodii'' (probably written by Methodius' successor [[Gorazd]]) are biographies with valuable information about Great Moravia under Rastislav and Sv\u00e4topluk I.\n\nThe brothers also founded an academy, initially led by Methodius, which produced hundreds of Slavic clerics. A well-educated class was essential for administration of all early-feudal states and Great Moravia was no exception. ''Vita Methodii'' mentions that the bishop of Nitra served as Sv\u00e4topluk I's chancellor, and even Prince [[Koce\u013e]] of the [[Balaton Principality]] was said to have mastered the Glagolitic script.<ref name=\"methodii\"/> The location of the Great Moravian academy has not been identified, but possible sites include Mikul\u010dice (where some [[stylus|styli]] have been found in an ecclesiastical building), Dev\u00edn Castle (with a building identified as a probable school), and Nitra (with its Episcopal basilica and monastery). When Methodius\u2019 disciples were expelled from Great Moravia by Sv\u00e4topluk I in 885, they disseminated their knowledge (including the Glagolitic script) to other Slavic countries, such as [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], and Bohemia. They created the [[Cyrillic script]], which became the standard alphabet in the [[Kievan Rus']] (modern day Russia, Ukraine and Belarus).

The fate of the northern and western parts of former [[Central Europe]] in the 10th century is thus largely unclear.\n\nThe eastern part of the Great Moravian core territory (present-day Slovakia) fell under domination of the Hungarian [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]]. The northwest borders of the Principality of Hungary became a mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited land. This was the Hungarian ''gyep\u0171elve'', and it can be considered as a march that effectively lasted until the mid-13th century.<ref name=\"slovensko\">{{Cite book| author=Tibensk\u00fd, J\u00e1n| title =Slovensko: Dejiny| publisher =Obzor| year =1971| location =Bratislava}}</ref> The rest remained under the rule of the local Slavic aristocracy<ref name=\"lukacka\" /> and was gradually<ref name=\"marsina\">{{Cite journal|title=Ethnogenesis of Slovaks|journal=Human Affairs|year=1997|first=Richard|last=Marsina|volume=7|issue=1|pages=15\u201323 |url=}}</ref> integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary in a process finished in the 14th century.<ref name=\"slovensko\" /><ref name=\"pastor\">{{Cite book| last = P\u00e1stor | first = Zolt\u00e1n | authorlink = | title = Dejiny Slovenska: Vybran\u00e9 kapitoly | publisher = Univerzita Mateja Bela | year = 2000 | location = Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = }}</ref> In 1000 or 1001, all of present-day Slovakia was taken over by Poland under [[Boleslav I of Poland|Boleslav I]], and much of this territory became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] by 1031.{{sfn|Kirschbaum|2005|p = }}<ref name=\"slovensko\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Moravia]]\n* [[History of Slovakia]]\n* [[History of the Czech lands]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Primary sources===\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*\"King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon Version of Orosius\" (1852).
