The convention consists of all Bundestag members, as well as an equal number of electors elected by the state legislatures in proportion to their respective populations. Since reunification, all Federal Conventions have had more than 1200 members, as the Bundestag has always had more than 600 since then. It is not required that state electors are chosen from the members of the state legislature; often some prominent citizens are chosen.\n\nThe German constitution, the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], requires that the convention be convened no later than 30 days before the scheduled expiry of the sitting president's term or 30 days after a premature expiry of a president's term. The body is convened and chaired by the [[President of the Bundestag|president of the Bundestag]]. From 1979 to 2009, all these conventions were held on 23 May, the anniversary of the foundation of the Federal Republic in 1949. However, the two most recent elections before 2017 were held on different dates after the incumbent presidents, [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] and [[Christian Wulff]], resigned before the end of their terms, in 2010 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIn the first two rounds of the election, the candidate who achieves an absolute majority is elected. If, after two votes, no single candidate has received this level of support, in the third and final vote the candidate who wins a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes cast is elected.\n\nThe result of the election is often determined by party politics. In most cases, the candidate of the majority party or coalition in the Bundestag is considered to be the likely winner. However, as the members of the Federal Convention vote by secret ballot and are free to vote against their party's candidate, some presidential elections were considered open or too close to call beforehand because of relatively balanced majority positions or because the governing coalition's parties could not agree on one candidate and endorsed different people, as they did in 1969, when [[Gustav Heinemann]] won by only 6 votes on the third ballot. In other cases, elections have turned out to be much closer than expected. For example, in 2010, Wulff was expected to win on the first ballot, as the parties supporting him (CDU, CSU and FDP) had a stable absolute majority in the Federal Convention. Nevertheless, he failed to win a majority in the first and second ballots, while his main opponent [[Joachim Gauck]] had an unexpectedly strong showing. In the end Wulff obtained a majority in the third ballot. If the opposition has turned in a strong showing in state elections, it can potentially have enough support to defeat the chancellor's party's candidate; this happened in the elections in 1979 and 2004. For this reason, presidential elections can indicate the result of an upcoming general election. According to a long-standing adage in German politics, \"if you can create a President, you can form a government.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Past presidential elections ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As yet (2017), only four presidents (Heuss, L\u00fcbke, von Weizs\u00e4cker and K\u00f6hler) have been elected for a second term and only two of them (Heuss and von Weizs\u00e4cker) completed those terms, while L\u00fcbke and K\u00f6hler resigned during their second term. The president must not be a member of the federal government or of a legislature at either the federal or state level.\n\n=== Oath ===\nOn taking office the president must take the following oath, stipulated by Article 56 of the Basic Law, in a joint session of the [[Bundestag]] and the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]] (it is the only event that demands such a joint session constitutionally). The religious references may optionally be omitted.\n\n<blockquote>I swear that I will dedicate my efforts to the well-being of the German people, enhance their benefits, avert harm from them, uphold and defend the Constitution and the statutes of the Federation, fulfil my duties conscientiously, and do justice to all. (So help me God.)<ref>{{cite book|title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland|pages=Article 56|nopp=true }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs German constitutional law does not consider oaths of office as ''constitutive'' but only as ''affirmative'', the president does not have to take the oath at the moment of entering office in order to be able to execute the powers of the office. The oath is usually administered during the first weeks of a president's term on a date convenient for a joint session of the [[Bundestag]] and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Nevertheless, a president persistently refusing to take the oath could face an impeachment.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Amtseid \u00e0 la Obama \u2013 Verfassungsrechtliche Grundfragen und Probleme des Amtseids nach dem Grundgesetz |journal = JURA - Juristische Ausbildung |issn=0170-1452 |last= Haensle |first=Walter|date=2009|volume=31|issue=9|pages=670\u2013676|doi=10.1515/JURA.2009.670|url=\nhttps://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/25798/1/Haensle_Amtseid.pdf}}</ref> If a president is re-elected for a second term, they do not take the oath again.\n\n== Duties and functions ==\n[[File:Berlin - Schloss Bellevue2.jpg|thumb|[[Schloss Bellevue|Bellevue Palace]], Berlin (primary seat)]]\n[[File:Villa Hammerschmidt Bonn Seite Adenauerallee 20080831.jpg|thumb|[[Hammerschmidt Villa]], Bonn (secondary seat)]]\nThe president is involved in the formation of the Federal Government and remains in close cooperation with it. Basically, the president is free to act on his own discretion. However, according to Article 58 of the German constitution, the decrees, and directives of the president require the [[countersignature]] of the [[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013)|chancellor]] or the corresponding [[government of Germany|federal minister]] in charge of the respective field of politics. This rule ensures the coherence of government action, similar to the system of checks and balances in the [[United States of America]]. There is no need for a countersignature if the president proposes appointments and dismisses the chancellor, convenes or dissolves the Bundestag according to Article 63, declares a legislative state of emergency, calls on a Chancellor and ministers to remain in office after the end of a Chancellor's term until a successor is elected or exercises his right to pardon on behalf of the federation, as these are exclusive powers of the president.\n\nTherefore, the president also receives the chancellor regularly for talks on current policy issues. German presidents also hold talks with individual federal ministers and other senior officials at their own discretion. The \"Head of the Office of the President\" represents the will and views of the president in the [[Federal Government of Germany|meetings of the Federal Cabinet]] and reports back to the president.<ref name=\"bundespraesident.de\">[http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/ConstitutionalBasis/InteractionBetweenConstitutionalOrgans/interactionbetweenconstitutionalorgans-node.html Official Website of the President of Germany: Interaction between constitutional organs.] Retrieved 29 April 2014</ref>\n\nThe president's most prominent powers and duties include:<ref name=\"bundespraesident.de\" />\n\n*Proposing the chancellor to the [[Bundestag]].\n*Appointing and dismissing the chancellor and their cabinet ministers\n*Dissolving the Bundestag under certain circumstances\n*Declaring the legislative state of emergency under certain circumstances\n*Convening the Bundestag\n*Signing and promulgating laws or vetoing them under certain circumstances\n*Appointing and dismissing federal judges, federal civil servants, and commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the Armed Forces\n*Exercising the power to pardon individual offenders on behalf of the Federation\n*Awarding honors on behalf of the Federation\n*Representing Germany at home and abroad\n\n=== Appointment of the Federal Government ===\nAfter the constitution of every new elected [[Bundestag]], which automatically ends the term of the [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]], and in every other case in which the office of chancellor has fallen vacant (death or resignation), the president proposes an individual as chancellor and must then, provided they are subsequently elected by a majority of all members of the current Bundestag (the so-called ''Chancellor-majority)'' on the first ballot, appoint them to the office. However, the Bundestag is free to disregard the president's proposal (which has, as of 2019, never happened), in which case the parliament must within 14 days elect another individual, whom the parties in the Bundestag can now propose themselves, to the post with the same so-called ''Chancellor-majority'', whom the president is then obliged to appoint. If the Bundestag does not manage to do so, on the 15th day after the first ballot the Bundestag must hold one last ballot: if an individual is elected with the ''Chancellor-majority'', the president is obliged to appoint them. If not, the president can either appoint as chancellor the individual who received a plurality of votes on this last ballot or dissolves the Bundestag. The president can dismiss the chancellor, but only if the Bundestag passes a [[constructive vote of no confidence]], electing a new chancellor with the ''Chancellor-majority'' at the same time.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book\n  |title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland\n  |at=Article 67\n  |language=German }}</ref> If this occurs, the president must dismiss the chancellor and appoint the successor elected by the Bundestag.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe president appoints and dismisses the remaining members of the [[Cabinet of Germany|federal government]] upon the proposal of the chancellor. This means that the president can appoint only candidates presented by the chancellor. It is unclear, whether the president can refuse to dismiss or appoint a federal minister proposed by the chancellor, as no president has ever done so.\n\nIn practice, the president only proposes a person as chancellor who has previously garnered a majority support in coalition talks and traditionally does not interfere in those talks. However, after the \"Jamaica coalition\" talks failed in late 2017, President Steinmeier invited several Bundestag party leaders to try to still bring them together to form a working government.\n\n=== Other appointments ===\nThe president appoints federal judges, federal civil servants, and military officers.\n\n=== Dissolution of the Bundestag ===\nIn the event that the Bundestag elects an individual for the office of chancellor by a plurality of votes, rather than a majority, on the 15th day of the election process, the president can, at their discretion, either appoint that individual as chancellor or dissolve the Bundestag, triggering a new election. In the event that a vote of confidence is defeated in the Bundestag, and the incumbent chancellor proposes a dissolution, the president may, at his discretion, dissolve the body within 21 days. As of 2010, this power has only been applied three times in the history of the Federal Republic. In all three occurrences, it is doubtful whether the motives for that dissolution were in accordance with the constitution's intentions. Each time the incumbent chancellor called for the vote of confidence with the stated intention of being defeated, in order to be able to call for new elections before the end of their regular term, as the Basic Law does not give the Bundestag a right to dissolve itself. The most recent occurrence was on 1 July 2005, when Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] asked for a vote of confidence, which was defeated.<ref>{{cite book\n  |title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland\n  |at=Articles 67 and 68\n  |language=German }}</ref>\n\n=== Promulgation of the law ===\nAll federal laws must be signed by the president before they can come into effect.<ref>{{cite book\n  |title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland\n  |at=Article 82\n  |language=German }}</ref> The president may refuse to sign the law, thus effectively vetoing it.

Only in cases in which the incumbent president had serious doubts about the constitutionality of a bill laid before him, he has refused to sign it. As yet (2019), this has happened only eight times and no president has done it more often than two times during his term:\n*in 1951 [[Theodor Heuss]] vetoed a bill concerning income and corporation taxes, because it lacked the consent of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (in Germany some bills at the federal level need the consent of the Bundesrat, and some do not, which can be controversial at times).\n*in 1961 [[Heinrich L\u00fcbke]] refused to sign a bill concerning business and workforce trades he believed to be unconstitutional, because of a violation of the free choice of job.\n*in 1969 [[Gustav Heinemann]] vetoed the \"Engineer Act\", because he believed this legislative area to be under the authority of the states.\n*in 1970 [[Gustav Heinemann]] refused to sign the \"Architects Act\" for the same reason.\n*in 1976 [[Walter Scheel]] vetoed a bill about simplification measures regarding the conscientious objection of conscription, because it lacked the - in his opinion necessary - consent of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]].\n*in 1991 [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]] refused to sign an amendment to the \"Air Traffic Act\" allowing the privatization of the air traffic administration, which he believed to be unconstitutional. He signed the bill later after the \"Basic Law\" was changed in this aspect.\n*in 2006 [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] vetoed a bill concerning flight control, because he believed it to be unconstitutional.\n*later the same year [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] vetoed the \"Consumer Information Act\" for the same reason.\n[[Karl Carstens]], [[Roman Herzog]], [[Johannes Rau]], [[Christian Wulff]], [[Joachim Gauck]] and [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] (as yet) have signed and promulgated all bills during their respective terms.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundespraesidenten-das-achte-nein-a-453425.html | title=Bundespr\u00e4sidenten: Das achte Nein| newspaper=Spiegel Online| date=2006-12-08}}</ref> <!-- somebody who understands German better needs to read to ref and summarize it with more information, right now it seems very vague (example, first mention of Koehler) -->\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\nThe president represents Germany in the world (Art. 59 Basic Law), undertakes foreign visits and receives foreign dignitaries. They also conclude treaties with foreign nations (which do not come into effect until affirmed by the Bundestag), accredit German diplomats and receive the letters of accreditation of foreign diplomats.\n\n=== Pardons and honours ===\nAccording to Article 60 (2) of the German Constitution, the president has the power to pardon. This means the president \"has the authority to revoke or commute penal or disciplinary sentences in individual cases. The federal president cannot, however, issue an amnesty waiving or commuting sentences for a whole category of offenses. That requires a law enacted by the Bundestag in conjunction with the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Due to the federal structure of Germany the federal president is only responsible for dealing with certain criminal matters (e.g. espionage and terrorism) and disciplinary proceedings against federal civil servants, federal judges, and soldiers\".<ref>[http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/WorkInGermany/OfficialFunctions/officialfunctions-node.html The Federal President of Germany \u2013 Official Functions.] Retrieved 29 April 2014</ref>\n\nIt is customary that the federal president becomes the honorary godfather of the seventh child in a family if the parents wish it. He also sends letters of congratulations to centenarians and long-time married couples.<ref>http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Amt-und-Aufgaben/Wirken-im-Inland/Jubilaeen-und-Ehrenpatenschaften/jubilaeen-und-ehrenpatenschaften-node.html (in German)</ref>\n\n===Legislative state of emergency ===\nArticle 81 makes it possible to enact a law without the approval of the Bundestag: if the Bundestag rejects a motion of confidence, but a new chancellor is not elected nor is the Bundestag dissolved, the chancellor can declare a draft law to be \"urgent\". If the Bundestag refuses to approve the draft, the cabinet can ask the federal president to declare a \"legislative state of emergency\" (''Gesetzgebungsnotstand'') with regard to that specific law proposal.\n\nAfter the declaration of the president, the Bundestag has four weeks to discuss the draft law. If it does not approve it the cabinet can ask the Federal Council for approval. After the consent of the Federal Council is secured, the draft law becomes law.\n\nThere are some constraints on the \"legislative state of emergency\". After a president has declared the state of emergency for the first time, the government has only six months to use the procedure for other law proposals. Given the terms provided by the constitution, it is unlikely that the government can enact more than one other draft law in this way.\n\nAlso, the emergency has to be declared afresh for every proposal. This means that the six months are not a period in which the government together with the president and the Federal Council simply replaces the Bundestag as lawgiver. The Bundestag remains fully competent to pass laws during these six months. The state of emergency also ends if the office of the chancellor ends. During the same term and after the six months, the chancellor cannot use the procedure of Article 81 again.\n\nA \"legislative state of emergency\" has never been declared. In case of serious disagreement between the chancellor and the Bundestag, the chancellor resigns or the Bundestag faces new elections. The provision of Article 81 is intended to assist the government for a short time, but not to use it in crisis for a longer period. According to constitutional commentator Bryde, Article 81 provides the executive (government) with the power to \"enable decrees in a state of emergency\" (''exekutives Notverordnungsrecht''), but for historical reasons the constitution avoided this expression.<ref>Bryde, in: von M\u00fcnch/Kunig, GGK III, 5.

Every president to date has suspended his party membership for the duration of his term. Presidents have, however, spoken publicly about their personal views on political matters. The very fact that a president is expected to remain above politics usually means that when he does speak out on an issue, it is considered to be of great importance.  In some cases, a presidential speech has dominated German political debate for a year or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/FTTV7M,3,0,Das_Amt_des_Bundespr%E4sidenten_und_sein_Pr%FCfungsrecht.html#art3 |title=''Das Amt des Bundespr\u00e4sidenten und sein Pr\u00fcfungsrecht'' |language=de |publisher=Bpb.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\n== Reserve powers ==\nAccording to article 81 of the German constitution, the president can declare a \"Legislation Emergency\" and allow the federal government and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] to enact laws without the approval of the [[Bundestag]]. He also has important decisive power regarding the appointment of a chancellor who was elected by [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] only, or the dissolution of the [[Bundestag]] under certain circumstances.\n\nIt is also theoretically possible, albeit a drastic step which has not happened since 1949, that the president refuses to sign legislation merely because he disagrees with its content, thus vetoing it, or refuse to approve a cabinet appointment.<ref>Heinrich Wilms: Staatsrecht I: Staatsorganisationsrecht unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung der F\u00f6deralismusreform. Stuttgart 2007. pp. 201 ff. (German)</ref> In all cases in which a bill was not signed by the federal president, all presidents have claimed that the bill in question was manifestly unconstitutional. For example, in the autumn of 2006, President [[Horst K\u00f6hler|K\u00f6hler]] did so twice within three months. Also, in some cases, a president has signed a law while asking that the political parties refer the case to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] in order to test the law's constitutionality.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:2017-03-19 Dietmar Woidke SPD Parteitag by Olaf Kosinsky-1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Dietmar Woidke]], the current President of the Bundesrat and deputy of the president of Germany]]\nThe Basic Law did not create an office of Vice President, but designated the president [[President of the German Bundesrat|of the Bundesrat]] (by constitutional custom the [[Minister President (Germany)|head of government of one of the sixteen German states]], elected by the Bundesrat in a predetermined order of annual alternation) as deputy of the president of Germany (Basic Law, Article 57). If the office of president falls vacant, they temporarily assume the powers of the president and acts as head of state until a successor is elected, but does not assume the office of president as such (which would be unconstitutional, as no member of a legislature or government at federal or state level can be president at the same time).

Horst K\u00f6hler, upon his resignation on May 31, 2010, became the first president to trigger this re-election process. [[Jens B\u00f6hrnsen]], [[List of mayors of Bremen|President of the Senate and Mayor of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] and at the time President of the Bundesrat, assumed the powers and duties of head of state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/koehlerruecktritt102.html |title=Interview zum K\u00f6hler-R\u00fccktritt: \"Das hat es noch nicht gegeben\" |publisher=tagesschau.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref> Similarly, when [[Christian Wulff]] resigned in 2012, it was [[Horst Seehofer]], Minister-President of [[Bavaria]], as President of the Bundesrat, who assumed the powers and duties of head of state. When Heinrich L\u00fcbke, on the other hand, announced his resignation in 1968, it only came into effect the following year, a mere three months before the scheduled end of his term and after the expedited election of his successor. Back in 1949 [[Karl Arnold]], at the time Minister-President of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and President of the Bundesrat, also acted as head of state for a few days: after the Basic Law had come into effect and he himself was elected as President of the Bundesrat, the first President of Germany was not yet elected and the office therefore vacant.\n\nNone of these three presidents of the Bundesrat acting as head of state, has used any of the more important powers of the president, as for example vetoing a law or dissolving the [[Bundestag]], although they would have been entitled to do so under the same conditions as the president.\n\n== Impeachment and removal ==\nWhile in office, the president enjoys immunity from prosecution and cannot be voted out of office or recalled. The only mechanism for removing the president is impeachment by the Bundestag or [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] for willfully violating German law. Once the Bundestag impeaches the president, the Federal Constitutional Court is charged with determining if they are guilty of the offence. If the charge is sustained, the court has the authority to remove the president from office.\n\n== Presidential office and symbols ==\n[[File:German Air Force A340-300(16+02) (6272414834).jpg|thumb|Presidential aircraft]]\n\n=== Residences and office ===\n[[File:Schloss Bellevue DSC8405.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial office in Bellevue Castle]]\nThe official residence of the president is [[Schloss Bellevue|Bellevue Palace]] in [[Berlin]]. The president's second official residence is the [[Hammerschmidt Villa]] in  [[Bonn]], the former capital city of [[West Germany]].\n\nThe Office of the President (''Bundespr\u00e4sidialamt'') is a supreme federal authority. It organizes the president's work, supports the president in the performance of his duties as Head of State and coordinates his working relationships with other parts of the German government and administration. Its top official, who takes precedence over all other [[State Secretaries|German state secretaries]], is the Head of the Office of the President (''Chef des Bundespr\u00e4sidialamts''). \n\nThe office and its staff advise the president, informs them of all developments in domestic and foreign affairs and carries out the instructions of the president or forwards these to the corresponding ministry or authority.<ref>Official website of the Federal President of Germany [http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/ConstitutionalBasis/ConstitutionalBasis-node.html] Retrieved 29 April 2014</ref>\n\n=== Transportation ===\nThe president's car is usually black, made in Germany and has the numberplate \"0 \u2013 1\" with the presidential standard on the right wing of the car. The president also uses a VIP helicopter operated by the Federal Police and VIP aircraft ([[Bombardier Global 5000]], [[Airbus A319CJ]], [[Airbus A310]] or [[Airbus A340|A340]]) operated by the German Ministry of Defence. When the president is on board, the flight's callsign is \"German Airforce 001\".\n\n=== Presidential standard ===  \n[[File:Flag of the President of Germany.svg|thumb|upright|The standard of the president of Germany as used from [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|1921 to 1933]] and since 1950]]\n\nThe standard of the president of Germany was adopted on 11 April 1921, and used in this design until 1933. A slightly modified version also existed from 1926, that was used in addition to the 1921 version. In 1933, these versions were both replaced by another modified version, that was used until 1935.\n\nThe Weimar-era presidential standard from 1921 was adopted again as presidential standard by a decision by President [[Theodor Heuss]] on 20 January 1950, when he also formally adopted other Weimar-era state symbols including the coat of arms. The eagle (''[[Reichsadler]]'', now called ''Bundesadler'') in the design that was used in the coat of arms and presidential standard in the Weimar Republic and today was originally introduced by a decision by President [[Friedrich Ebert]] on 11 November 1919.\n\n== History ==\nThe modern-day position of German president is significantly different from the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reich President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] \u2013 a position which held considerable power and was regarded as an important figure in political life.<ref>{{cite book |author=Zentner, Christian ''Ed''|author2=Bed\u00fcrftig, Friedemann ''Ed''|title=Das gro\u00dfe Lexikon des Dritten Reiches |publisher=S\u00fcdwest Verlag |location=M\u00fcnchen |year=1985 |pages=686 |language=German |isbn=978-3-517-00834-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\n{{Main|President of Germany (1919\u20131945)}}\nThe position of President of Germany was first established by the [[Weimar Constitution]], which was drafted in the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]] in 1918. In Germany the new head of state was called the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident''.\n\n[[Friedrich Ebert]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) served as Germany's first president, followed by [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. The office effectively came to an end upon Hindenburg's death in 1934 and its powers merged with those of [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] now ruled Germany as \"[[F\u00fchrer]] und [[Reichskanzler]]\", combining his previous positions in [[NSDAP|party]] and government. However, he did officially become President;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/stobrhpt.html|title=documentArchiv.de - Gesetz \u00fcber das Staatsoberhaupt des Deutschen Reichs (01.08.1934)|website=www.documentarchiv.de}}</ref> the office was not abolished (though the constitutionally mandated presidential elections every seven years did not take place in the Nazi era) and briefly revived at the end of the [[Second World War]] when Hitler appointed Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] as his successor as \"President of Germany\". D\u00f6nitz agreed to the surrender to the Allies and was arrested a few days later.<ref>{{cite book\n  |first=\n  |title=Reichgesetzblatt part I\n  |agency=Reich Government\n  |date=1 August 1934\n  |location=Berlin\n  |page=747\n  |publisher=[[:de:Bild:RGBL I 1934 S 0747.png]]{{Better source|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]|date=October 2015}}\n  |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Weimar Constitution]] created a [[semi-presidential system]] in which power was divided between the president, a cabinet and a parliament. The president enjoyed far greater power than the current president and had an active political role, rather than a largely ceremonial one. The influence of the president also increased greatly as a result of the instability of the Weimar period. The president had authority to appoint the chancellor and could dismiss the entire cabinet at any time. However, it was also necessary for the cabinet to enjoy the confidence of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] (parliament) because it could be removed by a [[vote of no confidence]].<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=The Constitution of the German Federation of 11 August 1919\n  |date=\n  |url=http://www.zum.de/psm/weimar/weimar_vve.php\n  |accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> All bills had to receive the signature of the president to become law and, although he did not have an absolute veto on legislation, he could insist that a law be submitted for the approval of voters in a [[referendum]]. The president also had authority to dissolve the Reichstag, conduct foreign affairs, and command the armed forces. Article 48 of the constitution also provided the president sweeping powers in the event of a crisis. If there was a threat to \"public order and security\" he could legislate by decree and suspend civil rights.\n\nThe Weimar constitution provided that the president be directly elected and serve a seven-year term. The election involved a form of the [[two-round system]]. However the first president was elected by the National Assembly and subsequently only two direct presidential elections actually occurred. These were the election of [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in 1925 and his re-election in 1932.\n\nThe system created by the Weimar constitution led to a number of problems. In particular, the fact that the president could appoint the cabinet, while the Reichstag had only a power of dismissal, created a high cabinet turn-over as ministers were appointed by the president only to be dismissed by the Reichstag shortly afterwards. Eventually Hindenburg stopped trying to appoint cabinets that enjoyed the confidence of the Reichstag and ruled by means of three \"presidential cabinets\" (''Pr\u00e4sidialkabinette''). Hindenburg was also able to use his power of dissolution to by-pass the Reichstag. If the Reichstag threatened to censure his ministers or revoke one of his decrees he could simply dissolve the body and be able to govern without its interference until elections had been held. This led to eight Reichstag elections taking place in the 14 years of the Republic's existence; only one parliamentary term, that of 1920\u20131924, was completed without elections being held early.\n\n=== German Democratic Republic (\"East Germany\") ===\n{{main|President of East Germany}}\nSocialist [[East Germany]] established the office of a head of state with the title of President of the Republic (German: ''Pr\u00e4sident der Republik'') in 1949, but abandoned the office with the death of the first president, [[Wilhelm Pieck]], in 1960 in favour of a [[State Council of the German Democratic Republic|collective head of state]]. All government positions of the East German socialist republic, including the presidency, were appointed by the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]].\n\n=== Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\", 1949\u20131990) ===\nWith the promulgation of the [[Grundgesetz]]  in 1949, the office of President of the Federal Republic (in German: ''Bundespr\u00e4sident'') was created in [[West Germany]].  Partly due to the misuse of presidential powers in the Weimar Republic, the office's powers were significantly reduced.  Not only is he indirectly elected, but most of the real power was transferred to the chancellor.\n\nBecause the [[reunification of Germany]] in 1990 was accomplished by the five East German states joining the Federal Republic, the president became the president of all German states without the establishment of a new presidential office.\n\n== List of presidents ==\n{{see also|List of presidents of Germany}}\n\nTwelve persons have served as President of the Federal Republic of Germany. Six of them were members of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] (L\u00fcbke, Carstens, von Weizs\u00e4cker, Herzog, K\u00f6hler, Wulff), three were members of the [[SPD]] (Heinemann, Rau, Steinmeier), two were members of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] (Heuss, Scheel) and one was independent (Gauck). Four presidents were ministers in the federal government before entering office (L\u00fcbke ''Agriculture'', Heinemann ''Justice'', Scheel, Steinmeier ''Foreign Affairs''), two of them (Scheel, Steinmeier) having been [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]]. Three were [[Minister president (Germany)|head of a state government]] (von Weizs\u00e4cker ''[[West Berlin]]'', Rau ''[[North Rhine-Westphalia]]'', Wulff ''[[Lower Saxony]]''), Rau having been [[President of the Bundesrat]]. Two were members of the [[Bundestag]] (Heuss, Carstens), Carstens having been [[President of the Bundestag]]. One was president of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (Herzog), director of the [[IMF]] (K\u00f6hler) and Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records (Gauck). Only four presidents (Heuss, L\u00fcbke, von Weizs\u00e4cker, K\u00f6hler) have been re-elected for a second five-year-term and only two of those (Heuss, von Weizs\u00e4cker) served the full ten years. Christian Wulff served the shortest tenure (1 year, 7 months and 18 days) of all presidents.\n\nThe president is (according to Art. 57 GG) deputised by the president [[President of the Bundesrat|of the Bundesrat]] who can perform any of the president's duties, if the president is temporarily unable to do so and delegates these duties to them (this frequently happens during state visits), or if the Presidency falls vacant, in which case he becomes acting head of state (not \"(acting) President\") until a successor is elected, which has to happen within thirty days. This has happened three times:\n*in 1949 [[Karl Arnold]] acted as head of state after the ''Grundgesetz'' came into effect on 7 September 1949 and before [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected by the [[1949 West German presidential election|1st Federal Convention]] on 12 September 1949.\n*in 2010 [[Jens B\u00f6hrnsen]] acted as head of state after the resignation of [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] and before the election of [[Christian Wulff]]. \n*in 2012 [[Horst Seehofer]] acted as head of state after the resignation of [[Christian Wulff]] and before the election of [[Joachim Gauck]].\n\n;

The convention consists of all Bundestag members, as well as an equal number of electors elected by the state legislatures in proportion to their respective populations. Since reunification, all Federal Conventions have had more than 1200 members, as the Bundestag has always had more than 600 since then. It is not required that state electors are chosen from the members of the state legislature; often some prominent citizens are chosen.\n\nThe German constitution, the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], requires that the convention be convened no later than 30 days before the scheduled expiry of the sitting president's term or 30 days after a premature expiry of a president's term. The body is convened and chaired by the [[President of the Bundestag|president of the Bundestag]]. From 1979 to 2009, all these conventions were held on 23 May, the anniversary of the foundation of the Federal Republic in 1949. However, the two most recent elections before 2017 were held on different dates after the incumbent presidents, [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] and [[Christian Wulff]], resigned before the end of their terms, in 2010 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIn the first two rounds of the election, the candidate who achieves an absolute majority is elected. If, after two votes, no single candidate has received this level of support, in the third and final vote the candidate who wins a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes cast is elected.\n\nThe result of the election is often determined by party politics. In most cases, the candidate of the majority party or coalition in the Bundestag is considered to be the likely winner. However, as the members of the Federal Convention vote by secret ballot and are free to vote against their party's candidate, some presidential elections were considered open or too close to call beforehand because of relatively balanced majority positions or because the governing coalition's parties could not agree on one candidate and endorsed different people, as they did in 1969, when [[Gustav Heinemann]] won by only 6 votes on the third ballot. In other cases, elections have turned out to be much closer than expected. For example, in 2010, Wulff was expected to win on the first ballot, as the parties supporting him (CDU, CSU and FDP) had a stable absolute majority in the Federal Convention. Nevertheless, he failed to win a majority in the first and second ballots, while his main opponent [[Joachim Gauck]] had an unexpectedly strong showing. In the end Wulff obtained a majority in the third ballot. If the opposition has turned in a strong showing in state elections, it can potentially have enough support to defeat the chancellor's party's candidate; this happened in the elections in 1979 and 2004. For this reason, presidential elections can indicate the result of an upcoming general election. According to a long-standing adage in German politics, \"if you can create a President, you can form a government.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Past presidential elections ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As yet (2017), only four presidents (Heuss, L\u00fcbke, von Weizs\u00e4cker and K\u00f6hler) have been elected for a second term and only two of them (Heuss and von Weizs\u00e4cker) completed those terms, while L\u00fcbke and K\u00f6hler resigned during their second term. The president must not be a member of the federal government or of a legislature at either the federal or state level.\n\n=== Oath ===\nOn taking office the president must take the following oath, stipulated by Article 56 of the Basic Law, in a joint session of the [[Bundestag]] and the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]] (it is the only event that demands such a joint session constitutionally). The religious references may optionally be omitted.\n\n<blockquote>I swear that I will dedicate my efforts to the well-being of the German people, enhance their benefits, avert harm from them, uphold and defend the Constitution and the statutes of the Federation, fulfil my duties conscientiously, and do justice to all. (So help me God.)<ref>{{cite book|title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland|pages=Article 56|nopp=true }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs German constitutional law does not consider oaths of office as ''constitutive'' but only as ''affirmative'', the president does not have to take the oath at the moment of entering office in order to be able to execute the powers of the office. The oath is usually administered during the first weeks of a president's term on a date convenient for a joint session of the [[Bundestag]] and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]].

However, according to Article 58 of the German constitution, the decrees, and directives of the president require the [[countersignature]] of the [[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013)|chancellor]] or the corresponding [[government of Germany|federal minister]] in charge of the respective field of politics. This rule ensures the coherence of government action, similar to the system of checks and balances in the [[United States of America]]. There is no need for a countersignature if the president proposes appointments and dismisses the chancellor, convenes or dissolves the Bundestag according to Article 63, declares a legislative state of emergency, calls on a Chancellor and ministers to remain in office after the end of a Chancellor's term until a successor is elected or exercises his right to pardon on behalf of the federation, as these are exclusive powers of the president.\n\nTherefore, the president also receives the chancellor regularly for talks on current policy issues. German presidents also hold talks with individual federal ministers and other senior officials at their own discretion. The \"Head of the Office of the President\" represents the will and views of the president in the [[Federal Government of Germany|meetings of the Federal Cabinet]] and reports back to the president.<ref name=\"bundespraesident.de\">[http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/ConstitutionalBasis/InteractionBetweenConstitutionalOrgans/interactionbetweenconstitutionalorgans-node.html Official Website of the President of Germany: Interaction between constitutional organs.] Retrieved 29 April 2014</ref>\n\nThe president's most prominent powers and duties include:<ref name=\"bundespraesident.de\" />\n\n*Proposing the chancellor to the [[Bundestag]].\n*Appointing and dismissing the chancellor and their cabinet ministers\n*Dissolving the Bundestag under certain circumstances\n*Declaring the legislative state of emergency under certain circumstances\n*Convening the Bundestag\n*Signing and promulgating laws or vetoing them under certain circumstances\n*Appointing and dismissing federal judges, federal civil servants, and commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the Armed Forces\n*Exercising the power to pardon individual offenders on behalf of the Federation\n*Awarding honors on behalf of the Federation\n*Representing Germany at home and abroad\n\n=== Appointment of the Federal Government ===\nAfter the constitution of every new elected [[Bundestag]], which automatically ends the term of the [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]], and in every other case in which the office of chancellor has fallen vacant (death or resignation), the president proposes an individual as chancellor and must then, provided they are subsequently elected by a majority of all members of the current Bundestag (the so-called ''Chancellor-majority)'' on the first ballot, appoint them to the office. However, the Bundestag is free to disregard the president's proposal (which has, as of 2019, never happened), in which case the parliament must within 14 days elect another individual, whom the parties in the Bundestag can now propose themselves, to the post with the same so-called ''Chancellor-majority'', whom the president is then obliged to appoint. If the Bundestag does not manage to do so, on the 15th day after the first ballot the Bundestag must hold one last ballot: if an individual is elected with the ''Chancellor-majority'', the president is obliged to appoint them. If not, the president can either appoint as chancellor the individual who received a plurality of votes on this last ballot or dissolves the Bundestag. The president can dismiss the chancellor, but only if the Bundestag passes a [[constructive vote of no confidence]], electing a new chancellor with the ''Chancellor-majority'' at the same time.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book\n  |title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland\n  |at=Article 67\n  |language=German }}</ref> If this occurs, the president must dismiss the chancellor and appoint the successor elected by the Bundestag.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe president appoints and dismisses the remaining members of the [[Cabinet of Germany|federal government]] upon the proposal of the chancellor. This means that the president can appoint only candidates presented by the chancellor. It is unclear, whether the president can refuse to dismiss or appoint a federal minister proposed by the chancellor, as no president has ever done so.\n\nIn practice, the president only proposes a person as chancellor who has previously garnered a majority support in coalition talks and traditionally does not interfere in those talks. However, after the \"Jamaica coalition\" talks failed in late 2017, President Steinmeier invited several Bundestag party leaders to try to still bring them together to form a working government.\n\n=== Other appointments ===\nThe president appoints federal judges, federal civil servants, and military officers.\n\n=== Dissolution of the Bundestag ===\nIn the event that the Bundestag elects an individual for the office of chancellor by a plurality of votes, rather than a majority, on the 15th day of the election process, the president can, at their discretion, either appoint that individual as chancellor or dissolve the Bundestag, triggering a new election. In the event that a vote of confidence is defeated in the Bundestag, and the incumbent chancellor proposes a dissolution, the president may, at his discretion, dissolve the body within 21 days. As of 2010, this power has only been applied three times in the history of the Federal Republic. In all three occurrences, it is doubtful whether the motives for that dissolution were in accordance with the constitution's intentions. Each time the incumbent chancellor called for the vote of confidence with the stated intention of being defeated, in order to be able to call for new elections before the end of their regular term, as the Basic Law does not give the Bundestag a right to dissolve itself. The most recent occurrence was on 1 July 2005, when Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] asked for a vote of confidence, which was defeated.<ref>{{cite book\n  |title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland\n  |at=Articles 67 and 68\n  |language=German }}</ref>\n\n=== Promulgation of the law ===\nAll federal laws must be signed by the president before they can come into effect.<ref>{{cite book\n  |title=Grundgesetz f\u00fcr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland\n  |at=Article 82\n  |language=German }}</ref> The president may refuse to sign the law, thus effectively vetoing it.

He signed the bill later after the \"Basic Law\" was changed in this aspect.\n*in 2006 [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] vetoed a bill concerning flight control, because he believed it to be unconstitutional.\n*later the same year [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] vetoed the \"Consumer Information Act\" for the same reason.\n[[Karl Carstens]], [[Roman Herzog]], [[Johannes Rau]], [[Christian Wulff]], [[Joachim Gauck]] and [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] (as yet) have signed and promulgated all bills during their respective terms.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundespraesidenten-das-achte-nein-a-453425.html | title=Bundespr\u00e4sidenten: Das achte Nein| newspaper=Spiegel Online| date=2006-12-08}}</ref> <!-- somebody who understands German better needs to read to ref and summarize it with more information, right now it seems very vague (example, first mention of Koehler) -->\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\nThe president represents Germany in the world (Art. 59 Basic Law), undertakes foreign visits and receives foreign dignitaries. They also conclude treaties with foreign nations (which do not come into effect until affirmed by the Bundestag), accredit German diplomats and receive the letters of accreditation of foreign diplomats.\n\n=== Pardons and honours ===\nAccording to Article 60 (2) of the German Constitution, the president has the power to pardon. This means the president \"has the authority to revoke or commute penal or disciplinary sentences in individual cases. The federal president cannot, however, issue an amnesty waiving or commuting sentences for a whole category of offenses. That requires a law enacted by the Bundestag in conjunction with the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Due to the federal structure of Germany the federal president is only responsible for dealing with certain criminal matters (e.g. espionage and terrorism) and disciplinary proceedings against federal civil servants, federal judges, and soldiers\".<ref>[http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/WorkInGermany/OfficialFunctions/officialfunctions-node.html The Federal President of Germany \u2013 Official Functions.] Retrieved 29 April 2014</ref>\n\nIt is customary that the federal president becomes the honorary godfather of the seventh child in a family if the parents wish it. He also sends letters of congratulations to centenarians and long-time married couples.<ref>http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Amt-und-Aufgaben/Wirken-im-Inland/Jubilaeen-und-Ehrenpatenschaften/jubilaeen-und-ehrenpatenschaften-node.html (in German)</ref>\n\n===Legislative state of emergency ===\nArticle 81 makes it possible to enact a law without the approval of the Bundestag: if the Bundestag rejects a motion of confidence, but a new chancellor is not elected nor is the Bundestag dissolved, the chancellor can declare a draft law to be \"urgent\". If the Bundestag refuses to approve the draft, the cabinet can ask the federal president to declare a \"legislative state of emergency\" (''Gesetzgebungsnotstand'') with regard to that specific law proposal.\n\nAfter the declaration of the president, the Bundestag has four weeks to discuss the draft law. If it does not approve it the cabinet can ask the Federal Council for approval. After the consent of the Federal Council is secured, the draft law becomes law.\n\nThere are some constraints on the \"legislative state of emergency\". After a president has declared the state of emergency for the first time, the government has only six months to use the procedure for other law proposals. Given the terms provided by the constitution, it is unlikely that the government can enact more than one other draft law in this way.\n\nAlso, the emergency has to be declared afresh for every proposal. This means that the six months are not a period in which the government together with the president and the Federal Council simply replaces the Bundestag as lawgiver. The Bundestag remains fully competent to pass laws during these six months. The state of emergency also ends if the office of the chancellor ends. During the same term and after the six months, the chancellor cannot use the procedure of Article 81 again.\n\nA \"legislative state of emergency\" has never been declared. In case of serious disagreement between the chancellor and the Bundestag, the chancellor resigns or the Bundestag faces new elections. The provision of Article 81 is intended to assist the government for a short time, but not to use it in crisis for a longer period. According to constitutional commentator Bryde, Article 81 provides the executive (government) with the power to \"enable decrees in a state of emergency\" (''exekutives Notverordnungsrecht''), but for historical reasons the constitution avoided this expression.<ref>Bryde, in: von M\u00fcnch/Kunig, GGK III, 5.

Every president to date has suspended his party membership for the duration of his term. Presidents have, however, spoken publicly about their personal views on political matters. The very fact that a president is expected to remain above politics usually means that when he does speak out on an issue, it is considered to be of great importance.  In some cases, a presidential speech has dominated German political debate for a year or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/FTTV7M,3,0,Das_Amt_des_Bundespr%E4sidenten_und_sein_Pr%FCfungsrecht.html#art3 |title=''Das Amt des Bundespr\u00e4sidenten und sein Pr\u00fcfungsrecht'' |language=de |publisher=Bpb.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\n== Reserve powers ==\nAccording to article 81 of the German constitution, the president can declare a \"Legislation Emergency\" and allow the federal government and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] to enact laws without the approval of the [[Bundestag]]. He also has important decisive power regarding the appointment of a chancellor who was elected by [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] only, or the dissolution of the [[Bundestag]] under certain circumstances.\n\nIt is also theoretically possible, albeit a drastic step which has not happened since 1949, that the president refuses to sign legislation merely because he disagrees with its content, thus vetoing it, or refuse to approve a cabinet appointment.<ref>Heinrich Wilms: Staatsrecht I: Staatsorganisationsrecht unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung der F\u00f6deralismusreform. Stuttgart 2007. pp. 201 ff. (German)</ref> In all cases in which a bill was not signed by the federal president, all presidents have claimed that the bill in question was manifestly unconstitutional. For example, in the autumn of 2006, President [[Horst K\u00f6hler|K\u00f6hler]] did so twice within three months. Also, in some cases, a president has signed a law while asking that the political parties refer the case to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] in order to test the law's constitutionality.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:2017-03-19 Dietmar Woidke SPD Parteitag by Olaf Kosinsky-1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Dietmar Woidke]], the current President of the Bundesrat and deputy of the president of Germany]]\nThe Basic Law did not create an office of Vice President, but designated the president [[President of the German Bundesrat|of the Bundesrat]] (by constitutional custom the [[Minister President (Germany)|head of government of one of the sixteen German states]], elected by the Bundesrat in a predetermined order of annual alternation) as deputy of the president of Germany (Basic Law, Article 57). If the office of president falls vacant, they temporarily assume the powers of the president and acts as head of state until a successor is elected, but does not assume the office of president as such (which would be unconstitutional, as no member of a legislature or government at federal or state level can be president at the same time).

[[Jens B\u00f6hrnsen]], [[List of mayors of Bremen|President of the Senate and Mayor of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] and at the time President of the Bundesrat, assumed the powers and duties of head of state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/koehlerruecktritt102.html |title=Interview zum K\u00f6hler-R\u00fccktritt: \"Das hat es noch nicht gegeben\" |publisher=tagesschau.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref> Similarly, when [[Christian Wulff]] resigned in 2012, it was [[Horst Seehofer]], Minister-President of [[Bavaria]], as President of the Bundesrat, who assumed the powers and duties of head of state. When Heinrich L\u00fcbke, on the other hand, announced his resignation in 1968, it only came into effect the following year, a mere three months before the scheduled end of his term and after the expedited election of his successor. Back in 1949 [[Karl Arnold]], at the time Minister-President of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and President of the Bundesrat, also acted as head of state for a few days: after the Basic Law had come into effect and he himself was elected as President of the Bundesrat, the first President of Germany was not yet elected and the office therefore vacant.\n\nNone of these three presidents of the Bundesrat acting as head of state, has used any of the more important powers of the president, as for example vetoing a law or dissolving the [[Bundestag]], although they would have been entitled to do so under the same conditions as the president.\n\n== Impeachment and removal ==\nWhile in office, the president enjoys immunity from prosecution and cannot be voted out of office or recalled. The only mechanism for removing the president is impeachment by the Bundestag or [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] for willfully violating German law. Once the Bundestag impeaches the president, the Federal Constitutional Court is charged with determining if they are guilty of the offence. If the charge is sustained, the court has the authority to remove the president from office.\n\n== Presidential office and symbols ==\n[[File:German Air Force A340-300(16+02) (6272414834).jpg|thumb|Presidential aircraft]]\n\n=== Residences and office ===\n[[File:Schloss Bellevue DSC8405.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial office in Bellevue Castle]]\nThe official residence of the president is [[Schloss Bellevue|Bellevue Palace]] in [[Berlin]]. The president's second official residence is the [[Hammerschmidt Villa]] in  [[Bonn]], the former capital city of [[West Germany]].\n\nThe Office of the President (''Bundespr\u00e4sidialamt'') is a supreme federal authority. It organizes the president's work, supports the president in the performance of his duties as Head of State and coordinates his working relationships with other parts of the German government and administration. Its top official, who takes precedence over all other [[State Secretaries|German state secretaries]], is the Head of the Office of the President (''Chef des Bundespr\u00e4sidialamts''). \n\nThe office and its staff advise the president, informs them of all developments in domestic and foreign affairs and carries out the instructions of the president or forwards these to the corresponding ministry or authority.<ref>Official website of the Federal President of Germany [http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/ConstitutionalBasis/ConstitutionalBasis-node.html] Retrieved 29 April 2014</ref>\n\n=== Transportation ===\nThe president's car is usually black, made in Germany and has the numberplate \"0 \u2013 1\" with the presidential standard on the right wing of the car. The president also uses a VIP helicopter operated by the Federal Police and VIP aircraft ([[Bombardier Global 5000]], [[Airbus A319CJ]], [[Airbus A310]] or [[Airbus A340|A340]]) operated by the German Ministry of Defence. When the president is on board, the flight's callsign is \"German Airforce 001\".\n\n=== Presidential standard ===  \n[[File:Flag of the President of Germany.svg|thumb|upright|The standard of the president of Germany as used from [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|1921 to 1933]] and since 1950]]\n\nThe standard of the president of Germany was adopted on 11 April 1921, and used in this design until 1933. A slightly modified version also existed from 1926, that was used in addition to the 1921 version. In 1933, these versions were both replaced by another modified version, that was used until 1935.\n\nThe Weimar-era presidential standard from 1921 was adopted again as presidential standard by a decision by President [[Theodor Heuss]] on 20 January 1950, when he also formally adopted other Weimar-era state symbols including the coat of arms. The eagle (''[[Reichsadler]]'', now called ''Bundesadler'') in the design that was used in the coat of arms and presidential standard in the Weimar Republic and today was originally introduced by a decision by President [[Friedrich Ebert]] on 11 November 1919.\n\n== History ==\nThe modern-day position of German president is significantly different from the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|Reich President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] \u2013 a position which held considerable power and was regarded as an important figure in political life.<ref>{{cite book |author=Zentner, Christian ''Ed''|author2=Bed\u00fcrftig, Friedemann ''Ed''|title=Das gro\u00dfe Lexikon des Dritten Reiches |publisher=S\u00fcdwest Verlag |location=M\u00fcnchen |year=1985 |pages=686 |language=German |isbn=978-3-517-00834-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\n{{Main|President of Germany (1919\u20131945)}}\nThe position of President of Germany was first established by the [[Weimar Constitution]], which was drafted in the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]] in 1918. In Germany the new head of state was called the ''Reichspr\u00e4sident''.\n\n[[Friedrich Ebert]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) served as Germany's first president, followed by [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. The office effectively came to an end upon Hindenburg's death in 1934 and its powers merged with those of [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] now ruled Germany as \"[[F\u00fchrer]] und [[Reichskanzler]]\", combining his previous positions in [[NSDAP|party]] and government. However, he did officially become President;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/stobrhpt.html|title=documentArchiv.de - Gesetz \u00fcber das Staatsoberhaupt des Deutschen Reichs (01.08.1934)|website=www.documentarchiv.de}}</ref> the office was not abolished (though the constitutionally mandated presidential elections every seven years did not take place in the Nazi era) and briefly revived at the end of the [[Second World War]] when Hitler appointed Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] as his successor as \"President of Germany\".

The president enjoyed far greater power than the current president and had an active political role, rather than a largely ceremonial one. The influence of the president also increased greatly as a result of the instability of the Weimar period. The president had authority to appoint the chancellor and could dismiss the entire cabinet at any time. However, it was also necessary for the cabinet to enjoy the confidence of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] (parliament) because it could be removed by a [[vote of no confidence]].<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=The Constitution of the German Federation of 11 August 1919\n  |date=\n  |url=http://www.zum.de/psm/weimar/weimar_vve.php\n  |accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> All bills had to receive the signature of the president to become law and, although he did not have an absolute veto on legislation, he could insist that a law be submitted for the approval of voters in a [[referendum]]. The president also had authority to dissolve the Reichstag, conduct foreign affairs, and command the armed forces. Article 48 of the constitution also provided the president sweeping powers in the event of a crisis. If there was a threat to \"public order and security\" he could legislate by decree and suspend civil rights.\n\nThe Weimar constitution provided that the president be directly elected and serve a seven-year term. The election involved a form of the [[two-round system]]. However the first president was elected by the National Assembly and subsequently only two direct presidential elections actually occurred. These were the election of [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in 1925 and his re-election in 1932.\n\nThe system created by the Weimar constitution led to a number of problems. In particular, the fact that the president could appoint the cabinet, while the Reichstag had only a power of dismissal, created a high cabinet turn-over as ministers were appointed by the president only to be dismissed by the Reichstag shortly afterwards. Eventually Hindenburg stopped trying to appoint cabinets that enjoyed the confidence of the Reichstag and ruled by means of three \"presidential cabinets\" (''Pr\u00e4sidialkabinette''). Hindenburg was also able to use his power of dissolution to by-pass the Reichstag. If the Reichstag threatened to censure his ministers or revoke one of his decrees he could simply dissolve the body and be able to govern without its interference until elections had been held. This led to eight Reichstag elections taking place in the 14 years of the Republic's existence; only one parliamentary term, that of 1920\u20131924, was completed without elections being held early.\n\n=== German Democratic Republic (\"East Germany\") ===\n{{main|President of East Germany}}\nSocialist [[East Germany]] established the office of a head of state with the title of President of the Republic (German: ''Pr\u00e4sident der Republik'') in 1949, but abandoned the office with the death of the first president, [[Wilhelm Pieck]], in 1960 in favour of a [[State Council of the German Democratic Republic|collective head of state]]. All government positions of the East German socialist republic, including the presidency, were appointed by the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]].\n\n=== Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\", 1949\u20131990) ===\nWith the promulgation of the [[Grundgesetz]]  in 1949, the office of President of the Federal Republic (in German: ''Bundespr\u00e4sident'') was created in [[West Germany]].  Partly due to the misuse of presidential powers in the Weimar Republic, the office's powers were significantly reduced.  Not only is he indirectly elected, but most of the real power was transferred to the chancellor.\n\nBecause the [[reunification of Germany]] in 1990 was accomplished by the five East German states joining the Federal Republic, the president became the president of all German states without the establishment of a new presidential office.\n\n== List of presidents ==\n{{see also|List of presidents of Germany}}\n\nTwelve persons have served as President of the Federal Republic of Germany. Six of them were members of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] (L\u00fcbke, Carstens, von Weizs\u00e4cker, Herzog, K\u00f6hler, Wulff), three were members of the [[SPD]] (Heinemann, Rau, Steinmeier), two were members of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] (Heuss, Scheel) and one was independent (Gauck). Four presidents were ministers in the federal government before entering office (L\u00fcbke ''Agriculture'', Heinemann ''Justice'', Scheel, Steinmeier ''Foreign Affairs''), two of them (Scheel, Steinmeier) having been [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]]. Three were [[Minister president (Germany)|head of a state government]] (von Weizs\u00e4cker ''[[West Berlin]]'', Rau ''[[North Rhine-Westphalia]]'', Wulff ''[[Lower Saxony]]''), Rau having been [[President of the Bundesrat]]. Two were members of the [[Bundestag]] (Heuss, Carstens), Carstens having been [[President of the Bundestag]]. One was president of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (Herzog), director of the [[IMF]] (K\u00f6hler) and Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records (Gauck). Only four presidents (Heuss, L\u00fcbke, von Weizs\u00e4cker, K\u00f6hler) have been re-elected for a second five-year-term and only two of those (Heuss, von Weizs\u00e4cker) served the full ten years. Christian Wulff served the shortest tenure (1 year, 7 months and 18 days) of all presidents.\n\nThe president is (according to Art. 57 GG) deputised by the president [[President of the Bundesrat|of the Bundesrat]] who can perform any of the president's duties, if the president is temporarily unable to do so and delegates these duties to them (this frequently happens during state visits), or if the Presidency falls vacant, in which case he becomes acting head of state (not \"(acting) President\") until a successor is elected, which has to happen within thirty days. This has happened three times:\n*in 1949 [[Karl Arnold]] acted as head of state after the ''Grundgesetz'' came into effect on 7 September 1949 and before [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected by the [[1949 West German presidential election|1st Federal Convention]] on 12 September 1949.\n*in 2010 [[Jens B\u00f6hrnsen]] acted as head of state after the resignation of [[Horst K\u00f6hler]] and before the election of [[Christian Wulff]]. \n*in 2012 [[Horst Seehofer]] acted as head of state after the resignation of [[Christian Wulff]] and before the election of [[Joachim Gauck]].\n\n;
