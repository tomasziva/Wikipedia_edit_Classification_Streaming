Chief farm products are rice, corn, and coconut. Livestock and poultry raising are also important sources of income. Tandag has a national [[Tandag Airport|secondary airport]] and a seaport.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nMany versions have been given regarding the name of Tandag. One such version said that Father Calan, Father Encarnacion and another priest were on their way to visit chieftain Suba to baptize his people. When one of the missionaries asked a native rowing their boat what name of the place was with fingers pointing downward, the native who naught the priest meant the school of fish, answered \"tamda\", meaning look down. This name later became Tandag. Father Encarnacion, the member of the group was later killed by the natives.\n\nThe other version says that when De la Vega landed in Tandag to subdue the ferocious Caragas as the rebellios natives were called then, he did not know the name of the place so he inquired from the native who was gathering the leaves of herbs locally known as [[lemon grass|tangad]]. The native who did not understand Spanish answered hesitantly \"tangad\". Later, the name was changed to Tandag.\n\nAnother story tells a group of Spanish soldiers and missionaries who lost their way. When they asked for correct direction, the natives who could not understand a word they said only laughed at them all while saying the word \"tank\", meaning lost. Thus the name Tandag aptly means lost.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Surigao del Sur Provincial Capitol.JPG|thumb|Surigao del Sur Provincial Capitol, Tandag City]]\n* Long before Tandag became what it is today\u2014the bustling capital town of Surigao del Sur was inhabited by the [[Lumad peoples#Manobo|Manobo]]s and the [[Lumad peoples#Mamanwa|Mamanwa]]s who lived along the river banks under the leadership of Suba, their Chieftain. Suba was later converted into Christianity by Father Juan de la Encarnacion, a Spanish missionary. After [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]\u2019s final conquest to the Philippines particularly on 1609, the Spanish government sent missionaries to subdue the hostile natives. One of these missionaries was Father Juan de la Vega who was assigned in Tandag. In an effort to establish a symbol of authority, Fr. dela Vega erected a stone fort and built a small settlement about a size of a football field enclosed by a stone wall. Out of this settlement rose the town of Tandag, which later on became a center of faith.\n* About this period, Tandag became a port of call to the Spanish Galleon that sailed along the southern part of Mindanao. Until today, it is generally believed that somewhere underneath the deep sea near Tandag's twin Linongao Islands lies a sunken galleon.\n* In 1650, Tandag became the capital town of Surigao or Caraga, then a district that covered the present provinces of Agusan, the two Surigaos and a part of Davao. As center of faith and capital town, Tandag was fortified with cottas which were erected sometime in the 18th century, within the northern part of the town and near the old cemetery at the western side. These fortifications served to protect the town from moro raids.\n*In several separate attacks between 1754 and 1767, the moro pirates wrought havoc and destruction to Tandag. Father Jose Ducos, a Jesuit from Iligan, came to rescue and rebuild Tandag from the ruins wrought by these moro raids. He established the Tandag Garrison and restored the Tandag priory. Although the Tandag fort somehow survived, part of it was demolished during the Second World War. Calamities like typhoons and earthquakes finished off what remained of it. This explains why no remains of these structures could be seen today.\n* World War II \u2013 For much of the war Tandag was free from Japanese occupation when the American and Filipino military forces surrendered in May 1942. However, on 27 April 1944, about 500 Japanese troops landed by a number of boats a short distance outside town. Most of the residents fled to the mountains nearby when the Japanese arrived. The 10th Military District of the U.S. Army maintained a guerrilla presence on Mindanao through World War II. Capt. Charles Hansen led a small group of guerrillas against the Japanese. Outnumbered, the guerrillas were unable to dislodge the Japanese and about ten days later another group of guerrillas made a second attempt to force the Japanese out. The Japanese remained in town several weeks and left after causing much damage in Tandag.<ref>Virginia Hansen Holmes, ''Guerrilla Daughter'' (Kent, Ohio: Kent State U. Press, 2009), pp. 127, 168.</ref><ref>Kent Holmes, ''Wendell Fertig and His Guerrilla Forces in the Philippines: Fighting the Japanese Occupation, 1942\u20131945'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2015), p. 72.</ref>\n* Real transformation was finally afforded to Tandag via [https://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno2786.html#.XqEvHKIzbcc Republic Act No. 2786],an act that created Surigao del Sur and whose salient measure made Tandag the capital and seat of the provincial government of Surigao del Sur.\n*On 23 June 2007, Tandag by virtue of [https://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno9392.html#.XqEv76Izbcc Republic Act No. 9392]became a city.\n\n==Cityhood==\n{{Main|League of Cities of the Philippines v.

Chief farm products are rice, corn, and coconut. Livestock and poultry raising are also important sources of income. Tandag has a national [[Tandag Airport|secondary airport]] and a seaport.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nMany versions have been given regarding the name of Tandag. One such version said that Father Calan, Father Encarnacion and another priest were on their way to visit chieftain Suba to baptize his people. When one of the missionaries asked a native rowing their boat what name of the place was with fingers pointing downward, the native who naught the priest meant the school of fish, answered \"tamda\", meaning look down. This name later became Tandag. Father Encarnacion, the member of the group was later killed by the natives.\n\nThe other version says that when De la Vega landed in Tandag to subdue the ferocious Caragas as the rebellios natives were called then, he did not know the name of the place so he inquired from the native who was gathering the leaves of herbs locally known as [[lemon grass|tangad]]. The native who did not understand Spanish answered hesitantly \"tangad\". Later, the name was changed to Tandag.\n\nAnother story tells a group of Spanish soldiers and missionaries who lost their way. When they asked for correct direction, the natives who could not understand a word they said only laughed at them all while saying the word \"tank\", meaning lost. Thus the name Tandag aptly means lost.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Surigao del Sur Provincial Capitol.JPG|thumb|Surigao del Sur Provincial Capitol, Tandag City]]\n* Long before Tandag became what it is today\u2014the bustling capital town of Surigao del Sur was inhabited by the [[Lumad peoples#Manobo|Manobo]]s and the [[Lumad peoples#Mamanwa|Mamanwa]]s who lived along the river banks under the leadership of Suba, their Chieftain. Suba was later converted into Christianity by Father Juan de la Encarnacion, a Spanish missionary. After [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]\u2019s final conquest to the Philippines particularly on 1609, the Spanish government sent missionaries to subdue the hostile natives. One of these missionaries was Father Juan de la Vega who was assigned in Tandag. In an effort to establish a symbol of authority, Fr. dela Vega erected a stone fort and built a small settlement about a size of a football field enclosed by a stone wall. Out of this settlement rose the town of Tandag, which later on became a center of faith.\n* About this period, Tandag became a port of call to the Spanish Galleon that sailed along the southern part of Mindanao. Until today, it is generally believed that somewhere underneath the deep sea near Tandag's twin Linongao Islands lies a sunken galleon.\n* In 1650, Tandag became the capital town of Surigao or Caraga, then a district that covered the present provinces of Agusan, the two Surigaos and a part of Davao. As center of faith and capital town, Tandag was fortified with cottas which were erected sometime in the 18th century, within the northern part of the town and near the old cemetery at the western side. These fortifications served to protect the town from moro raids.\n*In several separate attacks between 1754 and 1767, the moro pirates wrought havoc and destruction to Tandag. Father Jose Ducos, a Jesuit from Iligan, came to rescue and rebuild Tandag from the ruins wrought by these moro raids. He established the Tandag Garrison and restored the Tandag priory. Although the Tandag fort somehow survived, part of it was demolished during the Second World War. Calamities like typhoons and earthquakes finished off what remained of it. This explains why no remains of these structures could be seen today.\n* World War II \u2013 For much of the war Tandag was free from Japanese occupation when the American and Filipino military forces surrendered in May 1942. However, on 27 April 1944, about 500 Japanese troops landed by a number of boats a short distance outside town. Most of the residents fled to the mountains nearby when the Japanese arrived. The 10th Military District of the U.S. Army maintained a guerrilla presence on Mindanao through World War II. Capt. Charles Hansen led a small group of guerrillas against the Japanese. Outnumbered, the guerrillas were unable to dislodge the Japanese and about ten days later another group of guerrillas made a second attempt to force the Japanese out. The Japanese remained in town several weeks and left after causing much damage in Tandag.<ref>Virginia Hansen Holmes, ''Guerrilla Daughter'' (Kent, Ohio: Kent State U.
