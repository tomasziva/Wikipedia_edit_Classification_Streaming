{"title_page": "List of Perkins engines", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\nIn this '''List of Perkins engines''', ''family type'' refers to the two letter designation [[Perkins Engines]] gives each engine. This nomenclature was introduced in 1978 under Perkins' new engine numbering scheme, where the family type is encoded in each unique serial number. Engines that went out of production prior to 1978 may have been retroactively assigned a family type to expedite parts support (this is the case with the Perkins 4.107). Some engines never entered production, such as the Perkins 4.224, but were assigned a family type. In the early years, Perkins gave names to their engines, beginning with the smallest Wolf. The larger Lynx and Leopard followed (all four-cylinders), with the 1937 P6 was intended to be called the \"Panther.\" After a lawsuit from motorcycle manufacturer [[Phelon & Moore]], Perkins dropped the Panther (and Python and Puma for the corresponding P3 and P4 models) and stuck to abbreviations from then on.<ref name=theP6>{{cite web | url = https://sites.google.com/site/perkinslongserviceclub/heritage-snippets/the-p6-engine | work = Perkins Long Service Club | title = The P6 Engine: A Design Ahead of its Time | first = David | last = Boulton | date = May 2002 }}</ref>\n\nPerkins was sold by [[Massey Ferguson]]'s parent Varity Corporation in 1998, and is now a fully owned subsidiary of [[Caterpillar Inc]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Perkins engine Designations\n<!-- add No. of cylinders and capacity columns may be an idea-->\n|-\n!Family type Code !!

Condie, 2nd edition 2000, {{ISBN|0-907742-79-3}}\n''The 4 107T was used in UK Military electricity generating sets, the engines when in need an overhaul were rebuilt by a Kent based engineering works in [[Ramsgate]], adjacent to the inner Harbour known as Walkers Marine  (Marine Engineers) Ltd. Houchins of Ashford an MOD contractor would send an MOD inspector to verify dynamometer testing of power and smoke emissions both on start up and full power for one full hour (27 horsepower produced at 3000 rpm) being used near military front lines any excessive smoke whilst running would give the armies position away. When the transport vessel \"Atlantic conveyor\" was sunk during the Falklands conflict a large quantity of these generating units were lost. The engines were highly stressed due to turbo charging,  the 4-107T used a Holset Brand turbocharger without after-cooling, and the longer 4-108 pistons with extended skirts, also a toughened tufftrided crankshaft, larger diameter cylinder head studs were used to contain the high combustion pressures. The engines when rebuilt could take up to four days of diligent running on the \"Heenan and Froud\" water dynomometer with great care given regarding application and duration of the load as minor tightening was not un-common, and a heavy seizure could result in disassembly and liner and piston replacement. But once run in the process of gaining full power with minimal rpm overshoot or droop or heavy black smoke was achieved by finely adjusting the injection timing and governor load springs in the CAV DPA injection pump.''\n\nIan V Curtis recollections whilst an apprentice Diesel Engineer at Walkers Marine during the 1980s.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Perkins diesel engines}}\n*[http://www.perkins.com/ Perkins Engines Company]\n*[http://www.bel.cz/ Perkins in Czech Republic]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118060032/http://www.geocities.com/vintagebusuk/PerkinsCompanyHistory.htm  History of Perkins Engines]\n*[http://www.kanoomachinery.com/perkins Kanoo Machinery - Distributors in the Middle East]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://www.perkins.com/cda/files/287332/7/Engine%20Number%20Guide_PP827_01_09.pdf Perkins.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118060032/http://www.geocities.com/vintagebusuk/PerkinsCompanyHistory.htm Webcitation.org]\n\n{{Perkins Engines}}\n\n[[Category:Engine technology]]\n[[Category:Lists of engines|Perkins]]\n[[Category:Perkins engines]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\nIn this '''List of Perkins engines''', ''family type'' refers to the two letter designation [[Perkins Engines]] gives each engine. This nomenclature was introduced in 1978 under Perkins' new engine numbering scheme, where the family type is encoded in each unique serial number. Engines that went out of production prior to 1978 may have been retroactively assigned a family type to expedite parts support (this is the case with the Perkins 4.107). Some engines never entered production, such as the Perkins 4.224, but were assigned a family type. In the early years, Perkins gave names to their engines, beginning with the smallest Wolf. The larger Lynx and Leopard followed (all four-cylinders), with the 1937 P6 was intended to be called the \"Panther.\" After a lawsuit from motorcycle manufacturer [[Phelon & Moore]], Perkins dropped the Panther (and Python and Puma for the corresponding P3 and P4 models) and stuck to abbreviations from then on.<ref name=theP6>{{cite web | url = https://sites.google.com/site/perkinslongserviceclub/heritage-snippets/the-p6-engine | work = Perkins Long Service Club | title = The P6 Engine: A Design Ahead of its Time | first = David | last = Boulton | date = May 2002 }}</ref>\n\nPerkins was sold by [[Massey Ferguson]]'s parent Varity Corporation in 1998, and is now a fully owned subsidiary of [[Caterpillar Inc]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Perkins engine Designations\n<!-- add No. of cylinders and capacity columns may be an idea-->\n|-\n!Family type Code !!

Although, the problems were solved quite quickly and the engine was relaunched as the R6 Mk2, with a reduced rating of 104&nbsp;bhp at 2,500 rpm. Sales never recovered after the early problems and only 33,800 engines were built before production ended in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/perkinslongserviceclub/heritage-snippets/the-r6-engine |title=THE R6 ENGINE - Perkins longserviceclub |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}</ref>\n|-\n|''none''||[[Perkins S6|S6]]||  1939-05 to 1962-10 ||Six-cylinder, 377 cu. in.

Condie, 2nd edition 2000, {{ISBN|0-907742-79-3}}\n''The 4 107T was used in UK Military electricity generating sets, the engines when in need an overhaul were rebuilt by a Kent based engineering works in [[Ramsgate]], adjacent to the inner Harbour known as Walkers Marine  (Marine Engineers) Ltd. Houchins of Ashford an MOD contractor would send an MOD inspector to verify dynamometer testing of power and smoke emissions both on start up and full power for one full hour (27 horsepower produced at 3000 rpm) being used near military front lines any excessive smoke whilst running would give the armies position away. When the transport vessel \"Atlantic conveyor\" was sunk during the Falklands conflict a large quantity of these generating units were lost. The engines were highly stressed due to turbo charging,  the 4-107T used a Holset Brand turbocharger without after-cooling, and the longer 4-108 pistons with extended skirts, also a toughened tufftrided crankshaft, larger diameter cylinder head studs were used to contain the high combustion pressures. The engines when rebuilt could take up to four days of diligent running on the \"Heenan and Froud\" water dynomometer with great care given regarding application and duration of the load as minor tightening was not un-common, and a heavy seizure could result in disassembly and liner and piston replacement. But once run in the process of gaining full power with minimal rpm overshoot or droop or heavy black smoke was achieved by finely adjusting the injection timing and governor load springs in the CAV DPA injection pump.''\n\nIan V Curtis recollections whilst an apprentice Diesel Engineer at Walkers Marine during the 1980s.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Perkins diesel engines}}\n*[http://www.perkins.com/ Perkins Engines Company]\n*[http://www.bel.cz/ Perkins in Czech Republic]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118060032/http://www.geocities.com/vintagebusuk/PerkinsCompanyHistory.htm  History of Perkins Engines]\n*[http://www.kanoomachinery.com/perkins Kanoo Machinery - Distributors in the Middle East]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://www.perkins.com/cda/files/287332/7/Engine%20Number%20Guide_PP827_01_09.pdf Perkins.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080118060032/http://www.geocities.com/vintagebusuk/PerkinsCompanyHistory.htm Webcitation.org]\n\n{{Perkins Engines}}\n\n[[Category:Engine technology]]\n[[Category:Lists of engines|Perkins]]\n[[Category:Perkins engines]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1953-11 \u2192 1953\u201311 (14), 1974-04 \u2192 1974\u201304 (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Perkins_engines"}
