He served briefly in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with the [[Scots Greys]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], until a leg ailment \u2013 probably [[tuberculosis]] in the knee \u2013 forced him to return home. After recovering, now in peace-time, he served with his regiment on garrison duty.

Shortly before, he had had the chance to shoot a prominent American officer, accompanied by another in distinctive [[hussar]] dress, but decided not to do so, as the man had his back to him (Ferguson) and was unaware of his presence. A surgeon told Ferguson in the hospital that some American casualties had said that General [[George Washington|Washington]] had been in the area at the time.

Draper gives the lieutenant colonel's name as \"De Bosen.\" He states that Pulaski captured \"a few prisoners.\" He also identifies \"Juliet\" as a Hessian and a \"double deserter.\"</ref>\n\n===1779===\nFerguson was commissioned as a [[Major]] in the [[71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders|71st Foot]] on 25 October 1779.\n\n===1780===\nIn 1780, the British Army sent General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] to invade [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]]. His mission was to defeat all American forces in the Carolinas and keep the two colonies within the British Empire. A key part of Cornwallis's plan was to recruit soldiers from local [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. To achieve this goal, General Clinton appointed Major Ferguson as Inspector of [[Militia]] in [[South Carolina]].  Ferguson's mission was to recruit Loyalist militia in the Carolinas and Georgia and to intimidate any colonists who favoured American independence.\n\nMajor Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia on 22 May 1780. His task was to march to the [[Tryon County, North Carolina|old Tryon County]] area, raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina [[Backcountry]], and protect the left flank of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis']] main body at [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].<ref>Buchanan, 202</ref><ref>Dameron, 22</ref>\n\nAfter winning several victories over American forces, Cornwallis occupied [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in the summer of 1780. He divided his army and gave command of one section to Ferguson. Ferguson's wing consisted of Loyalists he had recruited to fight for the British cause.\n\n====Battle of Musgrove's Mill====\nOn the evening of 18 August 1780 two hundred mounted [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] partisans under joint command of Colonels [[Isaac Shelby]], [[James Williams (Revolutionary War)|James Williams]], and [[Elijah Clarke]] prepared to raid a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] camp at Musgrove\u2019s Mill, which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the [[Enoree River]].   The [[Battle of Musgrove Mill]], 19 August 1780 occurred near a ford of the [[Enoree River]], near the present-day border between [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[Laurens County, South Carolina|Laurens]] and [[Union County, South Carolina|Union]] Counties in [[South Carolina]].<ref>[http://www.southcarolinaparks.com/park-finder/state-park/3888.aspx Musgrove Mill State Historic Site website.]</ref>  The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists, but a local farmer informed them that the Tories had recently been reinforced by about a hundred Loyalist militia and two hundred provincial regulars on their way to join British Major Patrick Ferguson.<ref>John Buchanan, ''The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas'' (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), 177.  \"Provincial regulars\" were Americans who enlisted in British army units, as opposed to British [[regular army|regulars]] and Tory militia. Edgar, 153.</ref> The whole battle took perhaps an hour and within that period, sixty-three Tories were killed, an unknown number wounded, and seventy were taken prisoner.<ref>Buchanan and Edgar give the losses as 63 killed, 90 wounded, 70 taken prisoner. Buchanan, 178; Edgar, 115. The figures in the text are those from a wayside at [[Musgrove Mill State Historic Site]].</ref>  The Patriots lost only about four dead and twelve wounded.<ref>Buchanan gives Patriot losses as four killed and seven wounded. Buchanan, 179.</ref>\n\nSome Whig leaders briefly considered attacking the Tory stronghold at [[Ninety Six National Historic Site|Ninety Six]], South Carolina; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been [[Battle of Camden|defeated at Camden]] three days previous.\n\n====Pursuit of Shelby====\nShelby\u2019s forces covered sixty miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making good their escape.<ref>Edgar, 115, Buchanan, 179:  \"In forty-eight hours they had completed two forced marches, had neither slept nor rested, and had fought and won against a superior force an action renowned for its ferocity.\"</ref>  In the wake of General [[Horatio Gates]]\u2019 blundering defeat at Camden, the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories.\n\nShelby and his Overmountain Men crossed back over the Appalachian Mountains and fled back into the territory of the [[Watauga Association]] at [[Sycamore Shoals]] in present day [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]], and by the next month on 25 September 1780, Colonels Shelby, [[John Sevier]], and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the 7 October 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain near present day [[Blacksburg, South Carolina]].\n\nOn 2 September, Ferguson and the militia he had already recruited marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Mountain]] hill country on what is now the [[Tennessee]]/North Carolina border.<ref>Buchanan, 204</ref> By 10 September, Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would \"lay waste to their country with fire and sword.\"<ref>John Buchanan, ''The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas'' (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), p. 208.  \"Provincial regulars\" were Americans who enlisted in British army units, as opposed to British [[regular army|regulars]] and Tory militia. Edgar, 153.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina Patriot militia leaders [[Isaac Shelby]] and [[John Sevier]], from the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (now northeast Tennessee), met and agreed to lead their militiamen against him.<ref name=Buch210_1>Buchanan, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n====Battle of Kings Mountain====\nWhen Major Ferguson reportedly threatened to invade the mountains beyond the legal limit on westward settlement unless the colonists there abandoned the cause of American independence (Ferguson was actually in pursuit of Issac Shelby following the Battle of Musgrove's Mill), the Overmountain Men first mustered at [[Sycamore Shoals]] organised a militia to eventually fight Ferguson and his British Loyalists at [[King's Pinnacle]], an isolated ridge on the border between the Carolinas.\n\nOn 7 October 1780, the two armies clashed during the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]]. The battle went badly for the Loyalists positioned high on the mountain ridge, and during the fighting, Ferguson was shot from his horse. With his foot still in the stirrup, he was dragged to the rebel side. According to Rebel accounts, when a Patriot approached the major for his surrender, Ferguson drew his pistol and shot him as a last act of defiance. Other soldiers retaliated, and Ferguson's body was found with eight musket holes in it. Patriot accounts said their militia stripped his body of clothing and urinated on him before burial. They buried him in an oxhide near the site of his fall.\n\nOne of Ferguson's mistresses, 'Virginia Sal', was also killed in the battle and was buried with the officer. In the 1920s, the U.S. government erected a marker at Ferguson's gravesite, which today is a part of the [[Kings Mountain National Military Park]], administered by the [[National Park Service]].\n\nFerguson's personal correspondence reveals a man of intelligence, humour and charm. He also wrote several articles, satirical in tone, for publication in [[James Rivington|Rivington's]] ''Royal Gazette'', under the pseudonyms ''Egg-Shell'', ''Memento Mori'' and ''John Bull''.\n\nHe was survived by his mother, his brothers [[James Ferguson (Scottish politician)|James]] and [[George Ferguson (Lt Governor of Tobago)|George]], and sisters Annie, Elizabeth (Betty) (Mrs Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of Birkhill), and Jean.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn the novel ''[[Horse-Shoe Robinson]]'' (1835) by [[John Pendleton Kennedy]], an historical romance set against the background of the Southern campaigns in the American War of Independence, fictional characters interact with Ferguson as he is en route to the climactic scene in which he is killed in the Battle of Kings Mountain.\n\nIn [[Louis L'Amour|Louis L'Amour's]] book ''[[The Ferguson Rifle]]'' (1973), Ferguson stops by a poor family home on his way to the Battle of King's Mountain and kindly gives his personal copy of the Ferguson rifle to a boy who later carries it West. Ferguson is shown to be a gentleman who displays all the appropriate social graces to a lady (the boy's ill mother) and compassion to a family in need by giving up his personal firearm, asking only that the boy ''keep it always, and never use it against the king.'' (p7)\n\nIn [[Steve Ressel]]'s novel ''State Of One'' (2010), Ferguson is the main antagonist featured against James Pariah, a soldier formerly under Ferguson's command during the [[Battle of the Brandywine]] in 1777.  Ferguson had been resurrected as a [[golem]] by the Leeds Witch with hopes of raising a golem army of similar soldiers, all armed with [[Ferguson rifle]]s, to destroy the ratification of the [[US Constitution]] in September 1787.  James Pariah cleaves to his old Ferguson rifle, sometimes referring to it as his wife, having modified it with special actions such as a spring-loaded knife in the stock.\n\nIn [[Sharyn McCrumb]]'s novel ''Kings Mountain: A Ballad Novel'' (2014), Ferguson is the central antagonist.  Events leading to and the battle itself are covered from multiple viewpoints on both sides.\n\nIn the 2014 episode \"Patriots Rising\" of the television program [[The American Revolution (2014 miniseries)|''The American Revolution'']], Ferguson is portrayed as having George Washington in his gunsight, but choosing not to shoot.\n\nIn the outdoor drama ''[[Horn in the West]]'', Ferguson is portrayed harassing Daniel Boone's Patriot friends ultimately leading to the Battle of Kings Mountain whereby his final defiant moments are carried out by shooting a Patriot with his pistol.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|author=Alex R.

Ferguson reported his losses as two killed, three wounded, and one missing.<ref>Draper, 1881, p. 59. Draper gives the lieutenant colonel's name as \"De Bosen.\" He states that Pulaski captured \"a few prisoners.\" He also identifies \"Juliet\" as a Hessian and a \"double deserter.\"</ref>\n\n===1779===\nFerguson was commissioned as a [[Major]] in the [[71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders|71st Foot]] on 25 October 1779.\n\n===1780===\nIn 1780, the British Army sent General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] to invade [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]]. His mission was to defeat all American forces in the Carolinas and keep the two colonies within the British Empire. A key part of Cornwallis's plan was to recruit soldiers from local [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. To achieve this goal, General Clinton appointed Major Ferguson as Inspector of [[Militia]] in [[South Carolina]].  Ferguson's mission was to recruit Loyalist militia in the Carolinas and Georgia and to intimidate any colonists who favoured American independence.\n\nMajor Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia on 22 May 1780. His task was to march to the [[Tryon County, North Carolina|old Tryon County]] area, raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina [[Backcountry]], and protect the left flank of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis']] main body at [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].<ref>Buchanan, 202</ref><ref>Dameron, 22</ref>\n\nAfter winning several victories over American forces, Cornwallis occupied [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in the summer of 1780. He divided his army and gave command of one section to Ferguson. Ferguson's wing consisted of Loyalists he had recruited to fight for the British cause.\n\n====Battle of Musgrove's Mill====\nOn the evening of 18 August 1780 two hundred mounted [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] partisans under joint command of Colonels [[Isaac Shelby]], [[James Williams (Revolutionary War)|James Williams]], and [[Elijah Clarke]] prepared to raid a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] camp at Musgrove\u2019s Mill, which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the [[Enoree River]].   The [[Battle of Musgrove Mill]], 19 August 1780 occurred near a ford of the [[Enoree River]], near the present-day border between [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[Laurens County, South Carolina|Laurens]] and [[Union County, South Carolina|Union]] Counties in [[South Carolina]].<ref>[http://www.southcarolinaparks.com/park-finder/state-park/3888.aspx Musgrove Mill State Historic Site website.]</ref>  The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists, but a local farmer informed them that the Tories had recently been reinforced by about a hundred Loyalist militia and two hundred provincial regulars on their way to join British Major Patrick Ferguson.<ref>John Buchanan, ''The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas'' (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), 177.  \"Provincial regulars\" were Americans who enlisted in British army units, as opposed to British [[regular army|regulars]] and Tory militia. Edgar, 153.</ref> The whole battle took perhaps an hour and within that period, sixty-three Tories were killed, an unknown number wounded, and seventy were taken prisoner.<ref>Buchanan and Edgar give the losses as 63 killed, 90 wounded, 70 taken prisoner. Buchanan, 178; Edgar, 115. The figures in the text are those from a wayside at [[Musgrove Mill State Historic Site]].</ref>  The Patriots lost only about four dead and twelve wounded.<ref>Buchanan gives Patriot losses as four killed and seven wounded. Buchanan, 179.</ref>\n\nSome Whig leaders briefly considered attacking the Tory stronghold at [[Ninety Six National Historic Site|Ninety Six]], South Carolina; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been [[Battle of Camden|defeated at Camden]] three days previous.\n\n====Pursuit of Shelby====\nShelby\u2019s forces covered sixty miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making good their escape.<ref>Edgar, 115, Buchanan, 179:  \"In forty-eight hours they had completed two forced marches, had neither slept nor rested, and had fought and won against a superior force an action renowned for its ferocity.\"</ref>  In the wake of General [[Horatio Gates]]\u2019 blundering defeat at Camden, the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories.\n\nShelby and his Overmountain Men crossed back over the Appalachian Mountains and fled back into the territory of the [[Watauga Association]] at [[Sycamore Shoals]] in present day [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]], and by the next month on 25 September 1780, Colonels Shelby, [[John Sevier]], and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the 7 October 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain near present day [[Blacksburg, South Carolina]].\n\nOn 2 September, Ferguson and the militia he had already recruited marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Mountain]] hill country on what is now the [[Tennessee]]/North Carolina border.<ref>Buchanan, 204</ref> By 10 September, Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would \"lay waste to their country with fire and sword.\"<ref>John Buchanan, ''The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas'' (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), p. 208.  \"Provincial regulars\" were Americans who enlisted in British army units, as opposed to British [[regular army|regulars]] and Tory militia. Edgar, 153.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina Patriot militia leaders [[Isaac Shelby]] and [[John Sevier]], from the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (now northeast Tennessee), met and agreed to lead their militiamen against him.<ref name=Buch210_1>Buchanan, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n====Battle of Kings Mountain====\nWhen Major Ferguson reportedly threatened to invade the mountains beyond the legal limit on westward settlement unless the colonists there abandoned the cause of American independence (Ferguson was actually in pursuit of Issac Shelby following the Battle of Musgrove's Mill), the Overmountain Men first mustered at [[Sycamore Shoals]] organised a militia to eventually fight Ferguson and his British Loyalists at [[King's Pinnacle]], an isolated ridge on the border between the Carolinas.\n\nOn 7 October 1780, the two armies clashed during the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]]. The battle went badly for the Loyalists positioned high on the mountain ridge, and during the fighting, Ferguson was shot from his horse. With his foot still in the stirrup, he was dragged to the rebel side. According to Rebel accounts, when a Patriot approached the major for his surrender, Ferguson drew his pistol and shot him as a last act of defiance. Other soldiers retaliated, and Ferguson's body was found with eight musket holes in it. Patriot accounts said their militia stripped his body of clothing and urinated on him before burial. They buried him in an oxhide near the site of his fall.\n\nOne of Ferguson's mistresses, 'Virginia Sal', was also killed in the battle and was buried with the officer. In the 1920s, the U.S. government erected a marker at Ferguson's gravesite, which today is a part of the [[Kings Mountain National Military Park]], administered by the [[National Park Service]].\n\nFerguson's personal correspondence reveals a man of intelligence, humour and charm. He also wrote several articles, satirical in tone, for publication in [[James Rivington|Rivington's]] ''Royal Gazette'', under the pseudonyms ''Egg-Shell'', ''Memento Mori'' and ''John Bull''.\n\nHe was survived by his mother, his brothers [[James Ferguson (Scottish politician)|James]] and [[George Ferguson (Lt Governor of Tobago)|George]], and sisters Annie, Elizabeth (Betty) (Mrs Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of Birkhill), and Jean.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn the novel ''[[Horse-Shoe Robinson]]'' (1835) by [[John Pendleton Kennedy]], an historical romance set against the background of the Southern campaigns in the American War of Independence, fictional characters interact with Ferguson as he is en route to the climactic scene in which he is killed in the Battle of Kings Mountain.\n\nIn [[Louis L'Amour|Louis L'Amour's]] book ''[[The Ferguson Rifle]]'' (1973), Ferguson stops by a poor family home on his way to the Battle of King's Mountain and kindly gives his personal copy of the Ferguson rifle to a boy who later carries it West. Ferguson is shown to be a gentleman who displays all the appropriate social graces to a lady (the boy's ill mother) and compassion to a family in need by giving up his personal firearm, asking only that the boy ''keep it always, and never use it against the king.'' (p7)\n\nIn [[Steve Ressel]]'s novel ''State Of One'' (2010), Ferguson is the main antagonist featured against James Pariah, a soldier formerly under Ferguson's command during the [[Battle of the Brandywine]] in 1777.  Ferguson had been resurrected as a [[golem]] by the Leeds Witch with hopes of raising a golem army of similar soldiers, all armed with [[Ferguson rifle]]s, to destroy the ratification of the [[US Constitution]] in September 1787.  James Pariah cleaves to his old Ferguson rifle, sometimes referring to it as his wife, having modified it with special actions such as a spring-loaded knife in the stock.\n\nIn [[Sharyn McCrumb]]'s novel ''Kings Mountain: A Ballad Novel'' (2014), Ferguson is the central antagonist.  Events leading to and the battle itself are covered from multiple viewpoints on both sides.\n\nIn the 2014 episode \"Patriots Rising\" of the television program [[The American Revolution (2014 miniseries)|''The American Revolution'']], Ferguson is portrayed as having George Washington in his gunsight, but choosing not to shoot.\n\nIn the outdoor drama ''[[Horn in the West]]'', Ferguson is portrayed harassing Daniel Boone's Patriot friends ultimately leading to the Battle of Kings Mountain whereby his final defiant moments are carried out by shooting a Patriot with his pistol.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|author=Alex R.
