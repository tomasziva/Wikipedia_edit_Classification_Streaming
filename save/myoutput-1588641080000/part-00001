Located in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, the campus is set upon [[suburb]]an parkland in the residential [[List of neighbourhoods in Toronto|neighbourhood]] of [[Highland Creek, Toronto|Highland Creek]]. It was established in 1964 as Scarborough College, a [[collegiate university|constituent college]] of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science|Faculty of Arts and Science]]. The college expanded following its designation as an autonomic division of the university in 1972 and gradually became an independent institution.\n\nAcademics of the campus are centered on a variety of [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies in the [[List of academic disciplines|disciplines]] of management, arts and sciences, whilst also hosting limited [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] research programs. Its [[neuroscience]] program was the first to be offered in the nation. The campus is noted for being the university's sole provider of [[cooperative education]] programs, as well as the [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] degree. Through affiliation with the adjacent Centennial Science and Technology Centre of [[Centennial College]], it also offers enrolment in [[double degree|joint programs]].\n\nThe campus has traditionally held the annual [[Watts Lectures|F. B. Watts Memorial Lectures]], which has hosted internationally renowned [[scholar]]s since 1970. Its [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] laboratory was the first of its kind in Canada, allowing the campus to conduct influential research in the [[environmental science]]s. The original building of the campus was internationally acclaimed for its architectural design. The Dan Lang Field, home to the [[baseball]] team of the [[Toronto Varsity Blues]], is also situated at the campus.\n\n==History==\nThe {{Convert|152|ha|acre|adj=on}} land along the valley of the [[Highland Creek (Toronto)|Highland Creek]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]] was purchased in 1911 by [[Toronto]]-based businessman Miller Lash, who developed the site into his summer estate with a mansion, today known as the Miller Lash House. The mansion included 17 rooms, a barn, a [[Carriage house|coach house]], and three houses for his staff to dwell. Over the following years, over 100 acres of the estate was also used as farmland. Following the death of Miller Lash in 1941, the estate was acquired by E. L. McLean, an insurance broker, in 1944 for $59,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/2001/law0744.pdf|title=City of Toronto By-Law No. 744-2001|publisher=}}</ref> He made new additions to the estate, including a swimming pool and change room, and a [[retaining wall]] made in stone.\n\nAbout {{convert|82|ha|acre}} of property was later purchased from McLean, just before his death, by the [[University of Toronto]] for about $650,000 in 1963, as part of the university's regional expansion. The [[groundskeeping|groundskeeper]] of the land would continue to reside in the Highland Creek valley for the next 29 years. McLean's additions to the Miller Lash House, which would eventually become the residence of the campus's principal, were modernized and {{convert|70|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of surrounding land north of the estate were also acquired. The University of Toronto established the Scarborough College as part of the institution's [[collegiate university]] system and declared the campus as a [[satellite campus|branch]] of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science|Faculty of Arts and Science]]. D. C. Williams was appointed as the principal of Scarborough College and the planned [[University of Toronto Mississauga|Erindale College]], as well as [[Chancellor (education)|vice-president]] of the university. The college's faculty, consisting of 16 members, was also established and headquartered at the main campus in [[Downtown Toronto]]. First classes were held at [[Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute]] and Old Biology Building at the St. George campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discoverarchives.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/university-of-toronto-scarborough-library-2|title=University of Toronto.

The first building was completed in time for the following academic year.\n\nThe college included a {{convert|6000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} television production studio. This was for a unique video lecturing system the college was initially planned to have, that relies on the use of [[closed circuit television]] for teaching purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/news/bios/02/history14.htm|title=News - University of Toronto|website=www.utoronto.ca}}</ref> The system grabbed international media attention, and was complimented in the 1967 edition of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref name=\"the-underground.ca\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.the-underground.ca/2010/11/11/utsc%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Copen%E2%80%9D-minded-architecture-embraces-modernity/ |title=The Underground \u00bb UTSC\u2019s \"Open\"-minded Architecture |publisher=The-underground.ca |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> However, the video lecturing system was abandoned after it was condemned for the lack of communicability of students with instructors. In 1972, the campus was reorganized as a separately governed division of the university's Faculty of Arts and Science, developing its own curriculum. In 1973, it became the first [[higher education|post-secondary]] institution to adopt a [[course credit]] system in Ontario and the first [[cooperative education]] program was established. The campus adopted its present official name in 2006 after being renamed University of Toronto Scarborough Campus in 1983 and University of Toronto at Scarborough in 1996. The initials UTSC comes from the former name and continues to be used by the university to distinguish the campus from [[University of Toronto Schools]] (UTS).\n\n==Grounds==\n===Campus===\nFor much of its existence, the University of Toronto Scarborough was described as a \"mid-sized university campus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/article/dont-neglect-satellite-campuses-when-choosing-a-school/ |title=~ Don't neglect satellite campuses when choosing a school |publisher=Globecampus.ca |date=2009-11-27 |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319004044/http://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/article/dont-neglect-satellite-campuses-when-choosing-a-school/ |archivedate=March 19, 2012 }}</ref> It is the smallest of the three campuses of the University of Toronto by area.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Transforming Science Education in Ontario, University of Toronto Mississauga Working to Motivate Next Generation Innovators|date=11 October 2018|publisher=Newswire|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/transforming-science-education-in-ontario-university-of-toronto-mississauga-working-to-motivate-next-generation-innovators-696899311.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Varsity Contributors |title=Hell hath no fury like a campus scorned |url=https://thevarsity.ca/2018/01/29/hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-campus-scorned/ |website=The Varsity |date=29 January 2018}}</ref> It sits on {{convert|123|ha|acre}} of land, forming the west side of the [[Highland Creek, Toronto|Highland Creek]] neighbourhood in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]]. It is bounded entirely by [[Morningside Avenue (Toronto)|Morningside Avenue]] to the west. Its eastern, northern and southern borders are not definite, however; the campus grounds extend north slightly south of [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] and extends south slightly north of [[Kingston Road (Toronto)|Old Kingston Road]]. Its eastern boundary is [[Danforth Avenue|Military Trail]] while south of [[Ellesmere Road]] and slightly further east while north of Ellesmere Road. Unlike the university's downtown campus, the University of Toronto Scarborough is located in a [[suburban]] area, consisting of residential houses along its eastern side and [[urban forestry]] on its southern and western side. The neighbourhood's [[Highland Creek (Toronto)|namesake river]] runs through the southern portion of the grounds and its valley consists of pedestrian trails that link the campus to nearby [[List of parks in Toronto|parks]] and [[List of neighbourhoods in Toronto|neighbourhoods]].\n\nTransit bus service by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]], [[GO Transit]], and [[Durham Region Transit]] connect the campus to nearby transportation hubs.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[Image:John Andrews Building Scarborough 2010 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Looking west: Science Wing ahead, Bladen Building on the left, and the Arts and Administration Building on the right.]]\nThe Andrews Building, the first completed building of the campus named after its designer, John Andrews, was built in a [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] architectural style and completed in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://utsccommons.utsc.utoronto.ca/fall-2014/features/atop-valley |title=Atop the valley |publisher=University of Toronto Scarborough |date=Fall 2014}}</ref> The interiors were made to mimic streets of a city, with wide hallways and balconies on upper floors.

In response, the Academic Research Centre (ARC) and Joan Foley Hall were constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.utoronto.ca/presidents-message/university-of-toronto-double-cohort-students/ |title=Double Vision - How U of T coped with the cohort |publisher=UofT Magazine |date=Winter 2004}}</ref> The ARC was built in 2003 as an extension of the Bladen Building with a copper finish. It allowed for the relocation and expansion of the library to its present state and introduced the campus's first 300-seat lecture theatre, which has since held the [[Watts Lectures|Watts Lecture]] series, after formerly being held in the Meeting Place. The Doris McCarthy Gallery, also found in the ARC, exhibits works by local artist and campus alumni, [[Doris McCarthy]]. The Student Centre was opened in 2004 through a project that was initiated and funded by students. Constructed using 18 tonnes of recycled steel from a demolished gallery at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the three-storey Student Centre earned a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification as well as a Green Design Award from the City of Toronto.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://webapps.utsc.utoronto.ca/ose/story.php?id=3 | title = Acclaim for UTSC Student Centre Architecture, Design | publisher = University of Toronto Scarborough | date = May 4, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> The Social Sciences Building, home of the Department of Social Sciences, also opened in 2004 as the Management Wing but took its present name after the completion of the Instructional Centre in 2011, which became the new home of the Department of Management, the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, and offices of [[cooperative education]] programs.

None of these organizations have a house. As per their policy, the University of Toronto does not officially recognize neither fraternities nor sororities.\n\n===Residences===\nStudent residence is located primarily in the southern-most part of the campus, consisting mostly of [[townhouse]]-style homes and the Student Centre. The first residence area, the Student Village, which was able to accommodate 250 students, was opened in 1973 after pressure from traveling students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/aboutus/utsc-history|title=UTSC History|website=utsc.utoronto.ca|access-date=20 March 2017}}</ref> The townhouses are split into different halls, each bearing a different type of wood's name, in alphabetical order. These 'Phase 1' houses, the ones originally part of the Student Village, include Aspen, Birch, Cedar, Dogwood, and Elm hall. The next 'Phase 2' halls erected include Fir, Grey Pine, Hickory, and Ironwood hall. 'Phase 3' are the townhouses located north of the main campus, near the Science Research building, include Juniper, Koa, Larch, and Maple Hall. Over 600 people can live in the townhouses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~residences/townhouses.html|title=UTSC - Townhouses|website=utsc.utoronto.ca/~residences}}</ref> The townhouses feature shared common areas, kitchens, and bathrooms for students.\n\nThe four-story-high Joan Foley Hall, opened in 2003, is the first apartment-style residence complex on campus, named after the campus's first female principal.

Located in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, the campus is set upon [[suburb]]an parkland in the residential [[List of neighbourhoods in Toronto|neighbourhood]] of [[Highland Creek, Toronto|Highland Creek]]. It was established in 1964 as Scarborough College, a [[collegiate university|constituent college]] of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science|Faculty of Arts and Science]]. The college expanded following its designation as an autonomic division of the university in 1972 and gradually became an independent institution.\n\nAcademics of the campus are centered on a variety of [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies in the [[List of academic disciplines|disciplines]] of management, arts and sciences, whilst also hosting limited [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] research programs. Its [[neuroscience]] program was the first to be offered in the nation. The campus is noted for being the university's sole provider of [[cooperative education]] programs, as well as the [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] degree. Through affiliation with the adjacent Centennial Science and Technology Centre of [[Centennial College]], it also offers enrolment in [[double degree|joint programs]].\n\nThe campus has traditionally held the annual [[Watts Lectures|F. B. Watts Memorial Lectures]], which has hosted internationally renowned [[scholar]]s since 1970. Its [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] laboratory was the first of its kind in Canada, allowing the campus to conduct influential research in the [[environmental science]]s. The original building of the campus was internationally acclaimed for its architectural design. The Dan Lang Field, home to the [[baseball]] team of the [[Toronto Varsity Blues]], is also situated at the campus.\n\n==History==\nThe {{Convert|152|ha|acre|adj=on}} land along the valley of the [[Highland Creek (Toronto)|Highland Creek]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]] was purchased in 1911 by [[Toronto]]-based businessman Miller Lash, who developed the site into his summer estate with a mansion, today known as the Miller Lash House. The mansion included 17 rooms, a barn, a [[Carriage house|coach house]], and three houses for his staff to dwell. Over the following years, over 100 acres of the estate was also used as farmland. Following the death of Miller Lash in 1941, the estate was acquired by E. L. McLean, an insurance broker, in 1944 for $59,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/2001/law0744.pdf|title=City of Toronto By-Law No. 744-2001|publisher=}}</ref> He made new additions to the estate, including a swimming pool and change room, and a [[retaining wall]] made in stone.\n\nAbout {{convert|82|ha|acre}} of property was later purchased from McLean, just before his death, by the [[University of Toronto]] for about $650,000 in 1963, as part of the university's regional expansion. The [[groundskeeping|groundskeeper]] of the land would continue to reside in the Highland Creek valley for the next 29 years. McLean's additions to the Miller Lash House, which would eventually become the residence of the campus's principal, were modernized and {{convert|70|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of surrounding land north of the estate were also acquired. The University of Toronto established the Scarborough College as part of the institution's [[collegiate university]] system and declared the campus as a [[satellite campus|branch]] of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science|Faculty of Arts and Science]]. D. C. Williams was appointed as the principal of Scarborough College and the planned [[University of Toronto Mississauga|Erindale College]], as well as [[Chancellor (education)|vice-president]] of the university. The college's faculty, consisting of 16 members, was also established and headquartered at the main campus in [[Downtown Toronto]]. First classes were held at [[Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute]] and Old Biology Building at the St. George campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discoverarchives.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/university-of-toronto-scarborough-library-2|title=University of Toronto.

The first building was completed in time for the following academic year.\n\nThe college included a {{convert|6000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} television production studio. This was for a unique video lecturing system the college was initially planned to have, that relies on the use of [[closed circuit television]] for teaching purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/news/bios/02/history14.htm|title=News - University of Toronto|website=www.utoronto.ca}}</ref> The system grabbed international media attention, and was complimented in the 1967 edition of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref name=\"the-underground.ca\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.the-underground.ca/2010/11/11/utsc%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Copen%E2%80%9D-minded-architecture-embraces-modernity/ |title=The Underground \u00bb UTSC\u2019s \"Open\"-minded Architecture |publisher=The-underground.ca |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> However, the video lecturing system was abandoned after it was condemned for the lack of communicability of students with instructors. In 1972, the campus was reorganized as a separately governed division of the university's Faculty of Arts and Science, developing its own curriculum. In 1973, it became the first [[higher education|post-secondary]] institution to adopt a [[course credit]] system in Ontario and the first [[cooperative education]] program was established. The campus adopted its present official name in 2006 after being renamed University of Toronto Scarborough Campus in 1983 and University of Toronto at Scarborough in 1996. The initials UTSC comes from the former name and continues to be used by the university to distinguish the campus from [[University of Toronto Schools]] (UTS).\n\n==Grounds==\n===Campus===\nFor much of its existence, the University of Toronto Scarborough was described as a \"mid-sized university campus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/article/dont-neglect-satellite-campuses-when-choosing-a-school/ |title=~ Don't neglect satellite campuses when choosing a school |publisher=Globecampus.ca |date=2009-11-27 |accessdate=2012-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319004044/http://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/article/dont-neglect-satellite-campuses-when-choosing-a-school/ |archivedate=March 19, 2012 }}</ref> It is the smallest of the three campuses of the University of Toronto by area.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Transforming Science Education in Ontario, University of Toronto Mississauga Working to Motivate Next Generation Innovators|date=11 October 2018|publisher=Newswire|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/transforming-science-education-in-ontario-university-of-toronto-mississauga-working-to-motivate-next-generation-innovators-696899311.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Varsity Contributors |title=Hell hath no fury like a campus scorned |url=https://thevarsity.ca/2018/01/29/hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-campus-scorned/ |website=The Varsity |date=29 January 2018}}</ref> It sits on {{convert|123|ha|acre}} of land, forming the west side of the [[Highland Creek, Toronto|Highland Creek]] neighbourhood in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].

Its eastern, northern and southern borders are not definite, however; the campus grounds extend north slightly south of [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] and extends south slightly north of [[Kingston Road (Toronto)|Old Kingston Road]]. Its eastern boundary is [[Danforth Avenue|Military Trail]] while south of [[Ellesmere Road]] and slightly further east while north of Ellesmere Road. Unlike the university's downtown campus, the University of Toronto Scarborough is located in a [[suburban]] area, consisting of residential houses along its eastern side and [[urban forestry]] on its southern and western side. The neighbourhood's [[Highland Creek (Toronto)|namesake river]] runs through the southern portion of the grounds and its valley consists of pedestrian trails that link the campus to nearby [[List of parks in Toronto|parks]] and [[List of neighbourhoods in Toronto|neighbourhoods]].\n\nTransit bus service by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]], [[GO Transit]], and [[Durham Region Transit]] connect the campus to nearby transportation hubs.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[Image:John Andrews Building Scarborough 2010 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Looking west: Science Wing ahead, Bladen Building on the left, and the Arts and Administration Building on the right.]]\nThe Andrews Building, the first completed building of the campus named after its designer, John Andrews, was built in a [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] architectural style and completed in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://utsccommons.utsc.utoronto.ca/fall-2014/features/atop-valley |title=Atop the valley |publisher=University of Toronto Scarborough |date=Fall 2014}}</ref> The interiors were made to mimic streets of a city, with wide hallways and balconies on upper floors.

In response, the Academic Research Centre (ARC) and Joan Foley Hall were constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.utoronto.ca/presidents-message/university-of-toronto-double-cohort-students/ |title=Double Vision - How U of T coped with the cohort |publisher=UofT Magazine |date=Winter 2004}}</ref> The ARC was built in 2003 as an extension of the Bladen Building with a copper finish. It allowed for the relocation and expansion of the library to its present state and introduced the campus's first 300-seat lecture theatre, which has since held the [[Watts Lectures|Watts Lecture]] series, after formerly being held in the Meeting Place. The Doris McCarthy Gallery, also found in the ARC, exhibits works by local artist and campus alumni, [[Doris McCarthy]]. The Student Centre was opened in 2004 through a project that was initiated and funded by students.
