The weekend newscasts consist of '''''Newsroom Weekend''''', anchored by Menchu Macapagal and Ina Andolong-Chavenia at 6:00pm on weekends and at 12:00 noon on Saturdays, and a 15-minute weekend morning show '''''Newsroom Junior Edition''''' anchored by young contributors trained by CNN Philippines. It formerly aired the weekday noontime edition from 2015 to 2016, the 3:00pm edition dubbed as '''''Global Newsroom''''' from 2016 to 2017, and the 9:00 pm edition from 2016 to 2020.\n\n==Background==\n===As a noontime newscast===\nThe newscast was launched on March 16, 2015 as a 60-minute standalone noontime newscast, replacing ''[[Newsday (9News)|Newsday]]'' (which ran across CNN PH's predecessors TalkTV, Solar News Channel and 9TV). It was first anchored by former CNN Philippines News chief Jing Magsaysay and journalist Mai Rodriguez, who was held over from ''Newsday''.\n\nIn September 2015, Magsaysay left the newscast after his resignation following the \"right-sizing\" retrenchment of 70 junior staffers and contractual employees, who worked in the company for Programming and Technical Engineering divisions, leaving Rodriguez as the sole anchor for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2015/09/first-on-mnp-jing-magsaysay-resigns-as.html|title=First on MNP: Jing Magsaysay resigns as SVP of CNN Philippines|website=Medianewser.com|accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nOn February 15, 2016, the newscast expanded its airtime, aligning with [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|its international counterpart]]. However, the expansion reformatted from a single 60-minute newscast to three 30-minute editions in its initial run. The 8am edition was first anchored by the late [[Amelyn Veloso]], who formerly anchored ''[[CNN Philippines Headline News]]'' and was concurrently hosting ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]''. [[Claire Celdran]] replaced Rodriguez in the noontime edition while the latter became anchor of the network's weekend newscasts. The 9:00pm edition replaced ''[[CNN Philippines Nightly News]]'', anchored by its holdover, Mitzi Borromeo. The English-language noontime edition and the original broadcast of ''Newsroom'' was axed on April 4, 2016 and reformatted to ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]'' with [[Pinky Webb]].\n\nOn April 11, 2016, ''Newsroom'' debuted a 3 pm edition dubbed as ''Global Newsroom'' catering on international news relevant to Filipinos, first hosted by [[Claire Celdran]]. It carries the similar format of [[Global Conversations]], which was cancelled four months later (August 26).\n\nOn February 6, 2017, ''Newsroom'' launched its mid-morning edition in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] language dubbed as ''Newsroom Ngayon,'' anchored by Ruth Cabal replacing [[Serbisyo All Access]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/01/ruth-cabal-to-anchor-cnn-philippines.html|title=Updated: Ruth Cabal to anchor CNN Philippines' 'Newsroom Ngayon'|website=Medianewser.com|accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref> ''Newsroom Ngayon'' serves as a sister newscast with CNN Philippines' first Filipino language newscast, ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]'', which airs at midday.\n\nOn February 27, 2017, due to personnel reshuffling, Claire Celdran replaced Veloso at the 8 am slot while [[CNN Philippines Network News|Network News]] anchor [[Pia Hontiveros]] took over the ''Global Newsroom'' chair. Veloso would occasionally appear in special editions, until she died of cancer on August 24.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/08/cnn-anchor-amelyn-veloso-dies-at-42.html|title=CNN Philippines anchor Amelyn Veloso dies at 42|last=|first=|date=August 24, 2017|website=Medianewser.com|access-date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2017, ''Newsroom'' launched its weekend edition anchored by the pioneer weekday noontime anchor Mai Rodriguez. It started out at the Saturday noontime slot until April 1, 2017 when it expanded to include broadcasts on weekend evenings at 6 pm, following the cancellation of [[CNN Philippines Network News|Network News]] a week before as a result of the launching of ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night]]'' on weeknights from March 27. '''Newsroom Weekend''' later added a Sunday noontime edition on May 28, 2017 [[Marawi crisis|at the wake of the Marawi City crisis]]. Prior to a permanent weekend expansion, Rodriguez anchored special newscasts during severe weather coverage and other news of utmost importance.\n\nGlobal Newsroom aired its last broadcast on December 29, 2017, to gave way to the extension of [[Amanpour]] on January 1, 2018 as part of the network reorganization. Prior to the extension, some segments of the latter were usually aired on Global Newsroom.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, Mitzi Borromeo left the evening edition to pursue an advanced degree while retaining her position as host of Profiles and will appear on special editions. It was announced that former [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] anchor and former [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] undersecretary [[Cherie Mercado]] will replace Borromeo on the anchor chair beginning February 12. from February 1 to 9, [[Pia Hontiveros]] and correspondent Joyce Ilas took turns in anchoring the newscast in interim.\n\nIn 2018, [[Claire Celdran]] left both [[New Day (CNN Philippines)|New Day]] and the morning edition, citing more time to spend for her family. Former [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] anchor Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo replaced Celdran on both shows. Prior to this, Mai Rodriguez and Ruth Cabal took turns in filling-up Celdran's vacant spot.\n\nOn September 3, 2018, Ruth Cabal and Cherie Mercado switched anchoring duties, with Cabal leading the 9pm primetime edition and Mercado anchoring Newsroom Ngayon, citing personal reasons. CNN Philippines also launched a 15-minute weekend ''Newsroom Junior Edition'' on September 1 as part of the ''CNN PH Junior'' weekend morning block, featuring kids and young teens anchoring news bites of the day, similar to its predecessor [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]]'s [[NewsWatch Junior Edition]] (2008\u20132009) and [[NewsWatch (Philippine TV series)|Jr. NewsWatch]] (2005).\n\nIn May 2019, Cherie Mercado left Newsroom Ngayon, citing her move to Canada to study. Mai Rodriguez was tapped to replace Mercado while selected correspondents are doing the weekend edition for the month of June and July. On August 3, 2019, [[Claire Celdran]], who is returning to the network after a year, is named as the interim replacement for Rodriguez on Newsroom Weekend but she only anchors the Saturday midday edition and the Sunday edition with selected correspondents still anchoring the Saturday Primetime edition.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, Ruth Cabal returns to Newsroom Ngayon after more than a year doing the evening edition. She replaced Mai Rodriguez who is named as the new anchor for the evening edition.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, former [[BBC World News]] and [[CNBC]] anchor Rico Hizon takes over the 9pm edition, his first after coming home to the Philippines from international news stints in Singapore and Hong Kong.<ref>http://www.medianewser.com/2020/03/former-bbc-anchor-rico-hizon-joining-cnn-philippines.html</ref> On April 17, 2020, the evening edition was replaced by The Final Word, anchored by Hizon.\n\n===Special editions===\nWhen warranted, ''Newsroom'' would air special editions of the newscast, either within or beyond the current four-edition format. Emulating [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|its international counterpart]], ''Newsroom'' preempts programming for rolling news coverage and breaking stories (i.e. [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] hearings, and hooking up to [[CNN International]] during major relevant overseas coverage). However, when special events warrant during the early primetime slot, this function goes to ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night with Pia Hontiveros]]'' until 8:00 pm and only under the most dire situations would warrant preemption of the weeknight 9:00 pm edition in favor of uninterrupted coverage starting from where ''News Night'' leaves off.\n\n====EDSA and Muhammad Ali====\nUnder the initial three-split schedule, ''Newsroom'' aired additional editions on the 30th anniversary of the [[People Power Revolution]] and the aftermath of [[Muhammad Ali]]'s death, respectively, with the broadcast airing four times on February 25, 2016, all but one edition airing a full hour. On June 6, 2016, ''Global Newsroom'' ran a full hour covering the aftermath of the boxer's death. [[Mico Halili]] co-anchored the broadcast with [[Claire Celdran]] and Dr. Freddie Gomez providing medical perspective, augmenting the network's extended bulletins done on the day of Ali's death.\n\n====The Marawi City crisis====\nAt [[Battle of Marawi]] on May 23, 2017, the entire primetime current affairs block gave way to initial developments of the unfolding situation in the city with [[Pia Hontiveros]] anchoring uninterrupted coverage for four hours from 6:00 to 10:00 pm. Only the usual 10:00 pm edition of ''Sportsdesk'' was greenlit before Mitzi Borromeo resumed coverage for another half-hour. To further cope up with the developments in the city, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' added a special 2:00 pm edition during the third day of the conflict and ''Newsroom Weekend'' added a special Saturday morning edition on May 27 and a Sunday noontime edition on May 28. On the latter days of the conflict, ''Mindanao Hour'' press conferences were broadcast to serve as a lead in to ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]''.\n\n====Resorts World Manila robbery====\nThe incident marked the program's lengthiest uninterrupted coverage outside of scheduled political functions, totalling almost six hours. Ruth Cabal anchored a three-hour block from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, before breaking away to simulcast [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|CNN Newsroom International]]. Pia Hontiveros took the air from 2:00 to 2:30 and 3:00-5:00 pm. The coverage was heavily delivered in Filipino on the first two blocks before reverting to English on the extended slot of ''Global Newsroom''. Again, ''SportsDesk'' was greenlit but the planned morning edition was broadcast live-to-tape at 2:30 pm, deviating from the regular protocol of replaying the live 11:00 am broadcast on the slot. The following day, three editions was aired instead of the usual two for Saturdays. A special edition was aired at 10:00 am followed by the usual broadcast at 12:00 noon and the 6:00 pm edition was temporarily moved up to 5:30 pm and ran one and a half-hours covering the press conference revealing CCTV footage of the incident.\n\n====[[COVID-19 pandemic]]====\nOn March 17, 2020, it was announced that some newscasts including all the weekday editions of Newsroom are temporarily called off until things normalize due to skeletal workforce imposed by the network due to the Coronavirus pandemic. On March 30, 2020, the network brought back a special edition of Newsroom on its 9 pm timeslot with [[Rico Hizon]] as anchor. The special edition was replaced by The Final Word which aired beginning April 20, 2020. On April 2, 2020, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' was moved to 3 pm timeslot while the Saturday noontime edition was replaced by a 9 am Saturday edition and a 10 am Sunday Edition with Ina Andolong-Chavenia as anchor, while Menchu Macapagal replaced Claire Celdran on its 6 pm weekend edition. Currently, only the weekday morning edition remains off the air.\n\n==Current presenters==\nThe presenters of the broadcasts are arranged according to assigned slots and priority when special editions would warrant across their timeslots.\n* Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo (2018\u2013present, morning edition)\n* Ruth Cabal (2017\u20132018; 2019\u2013present, ''Newsroom Ngayon''; 2018-2019, evening edition)\n* Ina Andolong-Chavenia (2020\u2013present, weekend morning edition)\n* Menchu Macapagal (2020\u2013present, weekend evening edition)\n\n==Segments==\n===Newsroom===\n*CNN Philippines Investigates (investigative report)\n*The Business Report (business news)\n\n===Newsroom Ngayon===\n*Serbisyo Ngayon (public service)\n*Isyu Ngayon (hottest topics of the day)\n*Trabaho Ngayon (classifieds and job search)\n*Good Juan (human interest and inspiring stories)\n\n===Newsroom Junior Edition===\n*Here at Home (national news)\n*Did You Know That?

Former [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] anchor Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo replaced Celdran on both shows. Prior to this, Mai Rodriguez and Ruth Cabal took turns in filling-up Celdran's vacant spot.\n\nOn September 3, 2018, Ruth Cabal and Cherie Mercado switched anchoring duties, with Cabal leading the 9pm primetime edition and Mercado anchoring Newsroom Ngayon, citing personal reasons. CNN Philippines also launched a 15-minute weekend ''Newsroom Junior Edition'' on September 1 as part of the ''CNN PH Junior'' weekend morning block, featuring kids and young teens anchoring news bites of the day, similar to its predecessor [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]]'s [[NewsWatch Junior Edition]] (2008\u20132009) and [[NewsWatch (Philippine TV series)|Jr. NewsWatch]] (2005).\n\nIn May 2019, Cherie Mercado left Newsroom Ngayon, citing her move to Canada to study. Mai Rodriguez was tapped to replace Mercado while selected correspondents are doing the weekend edition for the month of June and July. On August 3, 2019, [[Claire Celdran]], who is returning to the network after a year, is named as the interim replacement for Rodriguez on Newsroom Weekend but she only anchors the Saturday midday edition and the Sunday edition with selected correspondents still anchoring the Saturday Primetime edition.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, Ruth Cabal returns to Newsroom Ngayon after more than a year doing the evening edition. She replaced Mai Rodriguez who is named as the new anchor for the evening edition.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, former [[BBC World News]] and [[CNBC]] anchor Rico Hizon takes over the 9pm edition, his first after coming home to the Philippines from international news stints in Singapore and Hong Kong.<ref>http://www.medianewser.com/2020/03/former-bbc-anchor-rico-hizon-joining-cnn-philippines.html</ref> On April 17, 2020, the evening edition was replaced by The Final Word, anchored by Hizon.\n\n===Special editions===\nWhen warranted, ''Newsroom'' would air special editions of the newscast, either within or beyond the current four-edition format. Emulating [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|its international counterpart]], ''Newsroom'' preempts programming for rolling news coverage and breaking stories (i.e. [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] hearings, and hooking up to [[CNN International]] during major relevant overseas coverage). However, when special events warrant during the early primetime slot, this function goes to ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night with Pia Hontiveros]]'' until 8:00 pm and only under the most dire situations would warrant preemption of the weeknight 9:00 pm edition in favor of uninterrupted coverage starting from where ''News Night'' leaves off.\n\n====EDSA and Muhammad Ali====\nUnder the initial three-split schedule, ''Newsroom'' aired additional editions on the 30th anniversary of the [[People Power Revolution]] and the aftermath of [[Muhammad Ali]]'s death, respectively, with the broadcast airing four times on February 25, 2016, all but one edition airing a full hour. On June 6, 2016, ''Global Newsroom'' ran a full hour covering the aftermath of the boxer's death. [[Mico Halili]] co-anchored the broadcast with [[Claire Celdran]] and Dr. Freddie Gomez providing medical perspective, augmenting the network's extended bulletins done on the day of Ali's death.\n\n====The Marawi City crisis====\nAt [[Battle of Marawi]] on May 23, 2017, the entire primetime current affairs block gave way to initial developments of the unfolding situation in the city with [[Pia Hontiveros]] anchoring uninterrupted coverage for four hours from 6:00 to 10:00 pm. Only the usual 10:00 pm edition of ''Sportsdesk'' was greenlit before Mitzi Borromeo resumed coverage for another half-hour. To further cope up with the developments in the city, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' added a special 2:00 pm edition during the third day of the conflict and ''Newsroom Weekend'' added a special Saturday morning edition on May 27 and a Sunday noontime edition on May 28. On the latter days of the conflict, ''Mindanao Hour'' press conferences were broadcast to serve as a lead in to ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]''.\n\n====Resorts World Manila robbery====\nThe incident marked the program's lengthiest uninterrupted coverage outside of scheduled political functions, totalling almost six hours. Ruth Cabal anchored a three-hour block from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, before breaking away to simulcast [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|CNN Newsroom International]]. Pia Hontiveros took the air from 2:00 to 2:30 and 3:00-5:00 pm. The coverage was heavily delivered in Filipino on the first two blocks before reverting to English on the extended slot of ''Global Newsroom''. Again, ''SportsDesk'' was greenlit but the planned morning edition was broadcast live-to-tape at 2:30 pm, deviating from the regular protocol of replaying the live 11:00 am broadcast on the slot. The following day, three editions was aired instead of the usual two for Saturdays. A special edition was aired at 10:00 am followed by the usual broadcast at 12:00 noon and the 6:00 pm edition was temporarily moved up to 5:30 pm and ran one and a half-hours covering the press conference revealing CCTV footage of the incident.\n\n====[[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic]]====\nOn March 17, 2020, it was announced that some newscasts including all the weekday editions of Newsroom are temporarily called off until things normalize due to skeletal workforce imposed by the network due to the Coronavirus pandemic. On March 30, 2020, the network brought back a special edition of Newsroom on its 9 pm timeslot with [[Rico Hizon]] as anchor. The special edition was replaced by The Final Word which aired beginning April 20, 2020. On April 2, 2020, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' was moved to 3 pm timeslot while the Saturday noontime edition was replaced by a 9 am Saturday edition and a 10 am Sunday Edition with Ina Andolong-Chavenia as anchor, while Menchu Macapagal replaced Claire Celdran on its 6 pm weekend edition. Currently, only the weekday morning edition remains off the air.\n\n==Current presenters==\nThe presenters of the broadcasts are arranged according to assigned slots and priority when special editions would warrant across their timeslots.\n* Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo (2018\u2013present, morning edition)\n* Ruth Cabal (2017\u20132018; 2019\u2013present, ''Newsroom Ngayon''; 2018-2019, evening edition)\n* Ina Andolong-Chavenia (2020\u2013present, weekend morning edition)\n* Menchu Macapagal (2020\u2013present, weekend evening edition)\n\n==Segments==\n===Newsroom===\n*CNN Philippines Investigates (investigative report)\n*The Business Report (business news)\n\n===Newsroom Ngayon===\n*Serbisyo Ngayon (public service)\n*Isyu Ngayon (hottest topics of the day)\n*Trabaho Ngayon (classifieds and job search)\n*Good Juan (human interest and inspiring stories)\n\n===Newsroom Junior Edition===\n*Here at Home (national news)\n*Did You Know That?
