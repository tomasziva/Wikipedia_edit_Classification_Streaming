The book describes his crisis of conscience with one of the Governing Body's decisions. World wide Jehovah's Witnesses were being imprisoned for refusing to be called up for military service, yet it was known and accepted by the Governing Body that Witnesses in a South American country could openly bribe the military officials to indicate on government documents that they had completed military service. This action was accepted by the Governing Body so as to allow these Witnesses to continue their missionary work.  He left the Governing Body in 1980 after a high-level inquiry was launched into allegations that several headquarters staff including Franz were spreading \"wrong teachings\". He moved to [[Alabama]] where he took up farm labouring work and was expelled from the religion in November 1981 for breaching an edict that Witnesses shun individuals who have formally resigned from the religion.<ref name=\"ostling\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922767-1,00.html \"Witness Under Prosecution\", Richard H.
