Later, the capital was moved to its present site upon realising that the town of Capiz was nearer to the sea and possessed better ground for docking facities. The Spaniards saw the long coastal cover and envisioned a trading and shipping center. Ports were subsequently built in Libas and  Culasi.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[Panay River]] divided the original settlement in two, and had tributaries from the mountains that flowed through communities that sprang up along its shores. The river provided irrigation and gradually fertilized the land, and during high tide , it provided water to the lowlands than became a private and commercial fishponds that exist to this day.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1590, the Spanish navy coming from [[Acapulco]], [[Viceroyalty of Mexico]] made the port of Capiz its naval yard where ships sought shelter when the sea was rough. Capiz grew into a bustling port and houses of stone were built. The social and political status enjoyed by indigenous rulers of Capiz often resulted in mixed marriages with colonial Spaniards. Their mestizo descendants became the base of the town's set of ''[[Principal\u00eda]]'', the colony's noble or patrician class. Their privileged status enabled them to build houses near the ''[[poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'', the downtown area whose focal points was the [[plaza]], the local chapel along Burgos Street, and the government complex.\n\nTheir children became the beneficiaries of the Augustinian mission in 1593.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1746, Capiz was made the seat of the politico-military government separating from the clutches of [[Iloilo]] is almost 200 years , although it was ecclesiastically controlled by the [[Archdiocese of Cebu|Bishopric of Cebu]]. In the latter part of 1795, under Gobernadorcillo Miguel Bautista, the old road to Baybay was built as an extension of calle San Roque .\n\nThe town was frequently attacked by Muslims that in 1814, stone forts at Baybay Beach (Baluarte) were built through the initiative of Gobernadorcillo Jos\u00e9 Consolaci\u00f3n.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1870, ground was broken for the construction of Capiz Cathedral under the guidance of Reverend Apolonio Alvarez. It was built by sturdy hands, sweat and blood of Capize\u00f1os, who were pressed into its building by the ''[[Corv\u00e9e#The Philippines|polo y servicios]]'' (forced labour) system. In 1876, the [[Archdiocese of Jaro|Diocese of Jaro]] in Iloilo was erected, and Capiz came under its jurisdiction. In 1877, the cathedral was finally finished.\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], the Spanish colonial government capitulated in August 1899, when Governor Juan Herrero formally surrendered to General Ananias Diokno along  Baybay area.\n\n===American colonial period===\nAfter 300 years under Spanish rule, the Philippine Islands came under the sovereignty of the United States of America. By the early 1900s, Protestant missionaries arrived in the Islands, which the various denominations subsequently agreed to divide into mission territories. Western Visayas went to the [[Baptists in the United States|American Baptists]]; Baptist institutions such as [[Filamer Christian University]], [[Central Philippine University]], Capiz Emmanuel Hospital were later established. In August 1904, Rev. and Mrs. Joseph Robbins were entrusted with care of three little children. This situation of neglected homeless children touched their hearts which led to the establishment of Capiz Home School, with the first building being a gift from the [[American Baptist International Ministries|American Baptist Foreign Mission Society]]. The Capiz Home School was later renamed Filamer Christian University, \"Filamer\" being a [[portmanteau]] of \"Filipino\" and \"American\".\n\nIn 1914, an economic debacle hit the town of Capiz when the Ayala Distillery abruptly stopped operations. What could have been an ambitious forerunner of nationalized industrialization became the victim of the Internal Revenue Law under American control.\n\nIn 1917, Division Superintendent of Schools F.E. Hemingway founded Capiz Trade School for intermediate pupils. The institution offered woodworking as the only vocational course. The next division superintendent opened Capiz High School.\n\nIn 1926, Division Superintendent Arthur Wittman authorized teaching of complete secondary curriculum in the Capiz Trade School. In the same year, Culasi Port was built to accommodate inter-island ships.\n\n===Third Philippine Republic===\nOn February 15, 1951, the [[Archdiocese of Capiz|Diocese of Capiz]] became a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction from Jaro. Its first bishop was Msgr. Manuel Yap. In the same year, Vice Mayor Libertad Conlu became the city's first female Mayor.\n\nCapiz became a chartered city on May 12, 1951 through House Bill 1528, sponsored by Ram\u00f3n Acu\u00f1a Arnaldo, the Representative of the First District of Capiz. It was approved by President [[Elpidio Quirino]], Roxas' successor, on April 11, 1951 as Republic Act 603.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra603-roxas-city-charter.html|title=An act creating the city of Roxas|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710155000/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra603-roxas-city-charter.html|archivedate=2012-07-10}}</ref> Consequently, the town was renamed Roxas City after the late Manuel Roxas, the final President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] and the first President of the Third Republic.\n\nThe city's first appointed Mayor was Lorenzo Acu\u00f1a Arnaldo, followed by Ram\u00f3n Berjamin Blanco, Jos\u00e9 Dorado, and Juliano Alovera Alba. In 1959, Arnaldo became the city's first elected head. He was succeeded by Teodoro Roxas Arcenas, who himself was succeeded by Juliano Alovera Alba. Alba was also the Representative of the First District of Capiz when President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] [[Proclamation No. 1081|declared]] [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] nationwide on September 21, 1972.\n\nAntonio A. del Rosario, the incumbent Representative of the First District of Capiz, was elected to three terms as Mayor, serving from 1998 to 2007. Vicente B. Bermejo, the former governor of the Province of Capiz, was elected Mayor and served from 2007 to 2010.\n\nRoxas City's current mayor is Ronnie T. Dadivas.\n\n===Historical Account of Pedro G. Gallardo, O.S.A.===\n\nCapiz is located on a small island formed by the Panay and Banica rivers. The Panay Rivers was famous, it is said by the great number of caimanes (alligators).\n\nThe soil is poor in the northern part of the island and is most productive only in the southern part. It is bounded by the Mindoro sea, the Panay River, Loctugan, the Mindoro Sea and Ibisan.\n\nIt enjoys balmy atmosphere and offers very picturesque views, especially from the open sea. This town was accepted in 1693 as a visita of the town of Panay. Fr. Agustin Estrada was named prior that same year. In 1707, it was declared an independent parish under the advocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nThe private council of 1716 created this town which was originally named El Puerto de Capiz, a vicariate under Fr. Pedro Vivaldi (?) as prior-vicar. In 1728, the convent was relieved from paying any rent to San Agustin Monastery. And likewise, in 1732. This suggests that the convent was rather poor or that the priors were building the parochial edifices. By this time, Loctugan and Ibisan were assigned to it as visitas.\nIn the middle of the 18th century, Capiz was declared the capital city of the province of the same name which later became \u201cthe most famous sea port and the biggest ministry the Augustinians had in that province.\u201d Capiz (or Capis) was renowned all over for its shells, the capis used for window panes on houses and convents all throughout the Philippines. Tradition holds that this is the place where the Visayas dialect is spoken with \u201cmore propriety and musicality\u201d and where \u201cwomen dress with more neatness, and elegance\u201d The Capize\u00f1os showed special loyalty to Spain during the British invasion, by sending money and ammunition to Manila and jailing the alcalde mayor, Se\u00f1or Quintanilla, who was caught \u201cconducting secret negotiation to have the province handed over peacefully to the British.\u201d\n\nIn 1732, Capiz had 2,327 souls. In 1760 Capiz had 3,971 of which 16 were Spaniards. In 1896, its population increased to 17,683. In 1990, it reached 103,171.\n\nCapiz was a progressive city in 1891, its exports through the sea port, reached 1,800,000 pesos and imports were valued at 900,000 pesos. It was a joy to watch, in the old times, the many boats converging, often at the same time, at the port to load rice.\u201d\nThe primitive church was built before 1698, the year in which the typhoon of January 4 destroyed it together with the convent.\nAccording to a document, the priest found it difficult \u201cto rebuild them because the people were not used to work.\u201d Fortunately, Fr. Domingo Horbegoso, minister of Capiz, started building the church in 1728, the year in which the convent was relieved from paying any rent to San Agustin Monastery. The construction seemed to have continued, at least until 1732 .\n\nCapiz was founded in 1693 under the advocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gallardo|first1=Pedro|title=Angels in Stone: Augustinian Churches in the Philippines|date=1996|location=Manila|<!-- accessdate=25 January 2016 -->}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoxas City is situated just east of the north-central coast of [[Panay Island]] with geographic coordinates of 11\u00b035' N, 122\u00b045' E.

Later, the capital was moved to its present site upon realising that the town of Capiz was nearer to the sea and possessed better ground for docking facities. The Spaniards saw the long coastal cover and envisioned a trading and shipping center. Ports were subsequently built in Libas and  Culasi.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[Panay River]] divided the original settlement in two, and had tributaries from the mountains that flowed through communities that sprang up along its shores. The river provided irrigation and gradually fertilized the land, and during high tide , it provided water to the lowlands than became a private and commercial fishponds that exist to this day.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1590, the Spanish navy coming from [[Acapulco]], [[Viceroyalty of Mexico]] made the port of Capiz its naval yard where ships sought shelter when the sea was rough. Capiz grew into a bustling port and houses of stone were built. The social and political status enjoyed by indigenous rulers of Capiz often resulted in mixed marriages with colonial Spaniards. Their mestizo descendants became the base of the town's set of ''[[Principal\u00eda]]'', the colony's noble or patrician class. Their privileged status enabled them to build houses near the ''[[poblacion|poblaci\u00f3n]]'', the downtown area whose focal points was the [[plaza]], the local chapel along Burgos Street, and the government complex.\n\nTheir children became the beneficiaries of the Augustinian mission in 1593.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1746, Capiz was made the seat of the politico-military government separating from the clutches of [[Iloilo]] is almost 200 years , although it was ecclesiastically controlled by the [[Archdiocese of Cebu|Bishopric of Cebu]]. In the latter part of 1795, under Gobernadorcillo Miguel Bautista, the old road to Baybay was built as an extension of calle San Roque .\n\nThe town was frequently attacked by Muslims that in 1814, stone forts at Baybay Beach (Baluarte) were built through the initiative of Gobernadorcillo Jos\u00e9 Consolaci\u00f3n.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1870, ground was broken for the construction of Capiz Cathedral under the guidance of Reverend Apolonio Alvarez. It was built by sturdy hands, sweat and blood of Capize\u00f1os, who were pressed into its building by the ''[[Corv\u00e9e#The Philippines|polo y servicios]]'' (forced labour) system. In 1876, the [[Archdiocese of Jaro|Diocese of Jaro]] in Iloilo was erected, and Capiz came under its jurisdiction. In 1877, the cathedral was finally finished.\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], the Spanish colonial government capitulated in August 1899, when Governor Juan Herrero formally surrendered to General Ananias Diokno along  Baybay area.\n\n===American colonial period===\nAfter 300 years under Spanish rule, the Philippine Islands came under the sovereignty of the United States of America. By the early 1900s, Protestant missionaries arrived in the Islands, which the various denominations subsequently agreed to divide into mission territories. Western Visayas went to the [[Baptists in the United States|American Baptists]]; Baptist institutions such as [[Filamer Christian University]], [[Central Philippine University]], Capiz Emmanuel Hospital were later established. In August 1904, Rev. and Mrs. Joseph Robbins were entrusted with care of three little children. This situation of neglected homeless children touched their hearts which led to the establishment of Capiz Home School, with the first building being a gift from the [[American Baptist International Ministries|American Baptist Foreign Mission Society]]. The Capiz Home School was later renamed Filamer Christian University, \"Filamer\" being a [[portmanteau]] of \"Filipino\" and \"American\".\n\nIn 1914, an economic debacle hit the town of Capiz when the Ayala Distillery abruptly stopped operations. What could have been an ambitious forerunner of nationalized industrialization became the victim of the Internal Revenue Law under American control.\n\nIn 1917, Division Superintendent of Schools F.E. Hemingway founded Capiz Trade School for intermediate pupils. The institution offered woodworking as the only vocational course. The next division superintendent opened Capiz High School.\n\nIn 1926, Division Superintendent Arthur Wittman authorized teaching of complete secondary curriculum in the Capiz Trade School. In the same year, Culasi Port was built to accommodate inter-island ships.\n\n===Third Philippine Republic===\nOn February 15, 1951, the [[Archdiocese of Capiz|Diocese of Capiz]] became a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction from Jaro. Its first bishop was Msgr. Manuel Yap. In the same year, Vice Mayor Libertad Conlu became the city's first female Mayor.\n\nCapiz became a chartered city on May 12, 1951 through House Bill 1528, sponsored by Ram\u00f3n Acu\u00f1a Arnaldo, the Representative of the First District of Capiz. It was approved by President [[Elpidio Quirino]], Roxas' successor, on April 11, 1951 as Republic Act 603.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra603-roxas-city-charter.html|title=An act creating the city of Roxas|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710155000/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra603-roxas-city-charter.html|archivedate=2012-07-10}}</ref> Consequently, the town was renamed Roxas City after the late Manuel Roxas, the final President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] and the first President of the Third Republic.\n\nThe city's first appointed Mayor was Lorenzo Acu\u00f1a Arnaldo, followed by Ram\u00f3n Berjamin Blanco, Jos\u00e9 Dorado, and Juliano Alovera Alba. In 1959, Arnaldo became the city's first elected head. He was succeeded by Teodoro Roxas Arcenas, who himself was succeeded by Juliano Alovera Alba. Alba was also the Representative of the First District of Capiz when President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] [[Proclamation No. 1081|declared]] [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] nationwide on September 21, 1972.\n\nAntonio A. del Rosario, the incumbent Representative of the First District of Capiz, was elected to three terms as Mayor, serving from 1998 to 2007. Vicente B. Bermejo, the former governor of the Province of Capiz, was elected Mayor and served from 2007 to 2010.\n\nRoxas City's current mayor is Ronnie T. Dadivas.\n\n===Historical Account of Pedro G. Gallardo, O.S.A.===\n\nCapiz is located on a small island formed by the Panay and Banica rivers. The Panay Rivers was famous, it is said by the great number of caimanes (alligators).\n\nThe soil is poor in the northern part of the island and is most productive only in the southern part. It is bounded by the Mindoro sea, the Panay River, Loctugan, the Mindoro Sea and Ibisan.\n\nIt enjoys balmy atmosphere and offers very picturesque views, especially from the open sea. This town was accepted in 1693 as a visita of the town of Panay. Fr. Agustin Estrada was named prior that same year. In 1707, it was declared an independent parish under the advocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nThe private council of 1716 created this town which was originally named El Puerto de Capiz, a vicariate under Fr. Pedro Vivaldi (?) as prior-vicar. In 1728, the convent was relieved from paying any rent to San Agustin Monastery. And likewise, in 1732. This suggests that the convent was rather poor or that the priors were building the parochial edifices. By this time, Loctugan and Ibisan were assigned to it as visitas.\nIn the middle of the 18th century, Capiz was declared the capital city of the province of the same name which later became \u201cthe most famous sea port and the biggest ministry the Augustinians had in that province.\u201d Capiz (or Capis) was renowned all over for its shells, the capis used for window panes on houses and convents all throughout the Philippines. Tradition holds that this is the place where the Visayas dialect is spoken with \u201cmore propriety and musicality\u201d and where \u201cwomen dress with more neatness, and elegance\u201d The Capize\u00f1os showed special loyalty to Spain during the British invasion, by sending money and ammunition to Manila and jailing the alcalde mayor, Se\u00f1or Quintanilla, who was caught \u201cconducting secret negotiation to have the province handed over peacefully to the British.\u201d\n\nIn 1732, Capiz had 2,327 souls. In 1760 Capiz had 3,971 of which 16 were Spaniards. In 1896, its population increased to 17,683. In 1990, it reached 103,171.\n\nCapiz was a progressive city in 1891, its exports through the sea port, reached 1,800,000 pesos and imports were valued at 900,000 pesos. It was a joy to watch, in the old times, the many boats converging, often at the same time, at the port to load rice.\u201d\nThe primitive church was built before 1698, the year in which the typhoon of January 4 destroyed it together with the convent.\nAccording to a document, the priest found it difficult \u201cto rebuild them because the people were not used to work.\u201d Fortunately, Fr. Domingo Horbegoso, minister of Capiz, started building the church in 1728, the year in which the convent was relieved from paying any rent to San Agustin Monastery. The construction seemed to have continued, at least until 1732 .\n\nCapiz was founded in 1693 under the advocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gallardo|first1=Pedro|title=Angels in Stone: Augustinian Churches in the Philippines|date=1996|location=Manila|<!-- accessdate=25 January 2016 -->}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoxas City is situated just east of the north-central coast of [[Panay Island]] with geographic coordinates of 11\u00b035' N, 122\u00b045' E.
