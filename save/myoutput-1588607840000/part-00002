It competes at Senior level in [[Tyrone GAA]] competitions (earlier clubs in the area having played at times in [[Fermanagh GAA]] competitions). The club plays [[Gaelic football]], [[Ladies' Gaelic football]] and [[camogie]].\n\n==History==\nA branch of the [[Gaelic League]] was formed in Trillick on 29 December 1901, and the League pioneered the playing of Gaelic games in 1902. At a Gaelic League [[Feis]] in Trillick on 15 August 1903, parish teams from Trillick, Golan, Moorfield and Liffer played the first competitive football games in Trillick. By December 1903, a parish football and hurling club, named '''Lisdoo Young Ireland''', had been formed, Lisdoo being one of only five teams taking part in the first Tyrone senior football championship in November 1904.<ref name=\"club\">[http://trillick-gac.com/ Trillick St McCartan's club website]</ref>\n\nIn 1906 the '''Trillick Red Hands''' football team was formed; in 1907 they reached the final of the first Cup Competition in Tyrone, the McAnespie Cup, presented by Trillick-born James McAnespie. The Red Hands, '''Glassmullagh St Colmcille's''' and '''Coa''' hurling teams, and '''Trillick''' and '''Knocknagor''' camogie teams, all from the Trillick parish, played at a Gaelic League Feis in Trillick on 15 August 1907. In 1909 there were three clubs in the parish: the Red Hands (which disbanded in 1910), '''Golan''' and '''Bundoran Junction \u00c9ire \u00d3gs'''; however until 1914, matches were only played on Feis days.<ref name=\"club\"/>\n\nThe '''Trillick MacDonagh's''' team functioned in 1914\u201318 and 1923\u201328, but many prominent players were lost in \"The Troubles\". The Gaelic League flourished up to 1920, Trillick parish priest Fr Matt Maguire being President of D\u00e1il Uladh.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the West Tyrone Board on 29 October 1931, the Trillick St Macartan's Club was formed in 1932, continuing to this day. The [[Ulster GAA|Ulster Council]] ruled in 1933 that the Tyrone County Board had jurisdiction over the club, rejecting the claim of Fermanagh.<ref name=\"club\"/>\n\nTrillick won the GAA's Centenary Year Club of Year Award in 1984.\n\n==Gaelic football==\nIn 1937 Trillick won its first senior championship, being League winners in 1937, 1938 and 1939. Beaten by the eventual champions in 1938, Trillick were awaiting the 1939 final when the Tyrone County Board declared that year's championship void. Trillick's Paddy Donnelly captained Tyrone's first ever cup-winning team, the [[Dr Lagan Cup]] winners, on 8 November 1942.\n\nTrillick U-16's were Tyrone champions in 1965, being beaten finalists in 1964 and 1968, the U-18's being County champions in 1968 and 1969. Trillick won the [[Tyrone Senior Football Championship]] again in 1974 (when they reached the [[Ulster Senior Club Football Championship]] final) and have won five subsequent titles. Relegated to the Intermediate ranks in 2007, Trillick won the Intermediate Football Championship in 2008 defeating Moy in the final in Carrickmore. They progressed to the [[Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship]], and became the first team from the parish to win a Provincial title defeating [[Greenlough GAC|Greenlough]] of [[Derry GAA|Derry]]. Upon promotion to Senior ranks in 2015 they then went on to win the Senior Championship the same year, beating [[Killyclogher]] in the final on 11 October 2015 on a scoreline of 1\u201309 to 0\u201311.  Trillick won another senior Championship in 2019 in remarkable fashion, beating Dromore by 17 points in the first round before beating Clonoe, holders Coalisland and Errigal Ciaran in the final on a score line of 0-12 to 2-4.\n\n\n===Honours===\n* '''[[Ulster Senior Club Football Championship]]'''\n** Runners-up 1974\n* '''[[Tyrone Senior Football Championship]]''' (8)\n** 1937, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1983, 1986, 2015, 2019<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hoganstand.com/Article/Index/304845 |title=Tyrone SFC final: Brennan fires Trillick to eighth title |accessdate=14 October 2019 |work=[[Hogan Stand]] |publisher= |date= 13 October 2019}}</ref>\n**Runners-up 1987\n**''(MacDonagh's)'' Runners-up 1917 \n* '''Tyrone All-County League''' Division 1 (10)\n** 1937, 1938, 1939, 1973, 1977, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987; runners-up 1976, 1978, 1981, 1998\n* '''Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship''' (1)\n** 2008; runners-up 2014\n* '''[[Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship]]:''' (1)\n** 2008\n\n===Notable players===\n*John Donnelly, captained Fermanagh in the 1970s, managed Tyrone 1990s\n*[[Mattie Donnelly (Gaelic footballer)|Matthew Donnelly]], [[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship]] medalist 2008 \n*Se\u00e1n Donnelly, reached All-Ireland Minor final 1975 and Senior final 1986, captained Tyrone seniors 1980s \n*[[Niall Gormley]], 2001 All Ireland Minor medal winner and 2008 [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] medal winner \n*Pat King, Tyrone captain 1970s, managed Fermanagh 1996\u20132000\n*Eddie Leonard, All-Ireland medallist with Tyrone minors 1948\n*Dan McElholm, Tyrone player 1917\n*Tommy McGee, Tyrone and Ulster player 1917\u201326\n*Lee Brennan, Tyrone Minor and MacRory Cup medal winner and Ulster Colleges all star medallist 2013, 2014 & 2015\n*Ruairi Kelly, Won an All Ireland U21, Son of Stevey and Roisin, hails from Tempo, choose to play for the Reds at a young age\n\n==Ladies' Gaelic football==\nTrillick Ladies Football Team won the Division Two League in 1995, and reached the county Championship final in 1999.\nWon the Tyrone and Ulster Junior Championship in 2018.\n\n===Notable players===\n*Sarah and Cathy Donnelly, in first Tyrone Ladies team to reach a Senior All-Ireland final, 2010\n*Sarah McGrade, Ulster and All-Ireland medallist with Tyrone Ladies, 1999\n\n==Hurling==\nGlassmullagh St Colmcille's Hurling Club was formed in Trillick parish in 1905, and the Coa club soon afterwards.
