According to Clemmont E. Vontress, the various religious traditions of Africa are united by a basic Animism. According to him, the belief in spirits and ancestors is the most important element of African religions. Gods were either self-created or evolved from spirits or ancestors which got worshiped by the people. He also notes that most modern African folk religions were strongly influenced by non-African religions, mostly Christianity and Islam and thus may differ from the ancient forms.<ref>{{Citation|last=Vontress|first=Clemmont E.|title=Animism: Foundation of Traditional Healing in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2005|url=https://sk.sagepub.com/books/integrating-traditional-healing-practices-into-counseling-and-psychotherapy/n11.xml|work=Integrating Traditional Healing Practices into Counseling and Psychotherapy|pages=124\u2013137|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|access-date=2019-10-31|doi=10.4135/9781452231648|isbn=9780761930471}}</ref>\n\n==Ceremonies==\nWest and Central African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by ''force'' (or ''ashe'', ''nyama'', etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or driving drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]] is the [[Okuyi]], practiced by several [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness.<ref name=\"Karade, B. pages 39-46\">Karade, B. ''The Handbook of Yoruba Religious Concepts'', pages&nbsp;39\u201346. Samuel Weiser Inc, 1994</ref> \n\nWhen this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech.  Also, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.<ref>Annemarie De Waal Malefijt (1968) ''Religion and Culture: an Introduction to Anthropology of Religion'', p.&nbsp;220\u2013249, Macmillan</ref>\n\n==Spirits==\n{{Main|List of African mythological figures}}\nFollowers of traditional African religions pray to various spirits as well as to their ancestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/the-spirituality-of-africa/|title=The spirituality of Africa|date=2015-10-06|website=Harvard Gazette|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> This includes also nature, elementary and animal spirits.

There are generally no prohibitions against the practice.

Traditional Niger-Congo religion also included polytheistic and animistic elements.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0K0p8wCNKTQC&dq=Christopher+Ehret+Niger+Congo+religion&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwix5JL8scvlAhWCTN8KHdYUB_8Q6AEwAHoECAAQAg The Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800]'', by Christopher Ehret, James Currey, 2002 </ref><ref>''[https://worldhistoryconnected.press.uillinois.edu/2.1/ehret.html, A Conversation with Christopher Ehret]''</ref><ref name=\"Okwu\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC&pg=RA1-PA185&lpg=RA1-PA185&dq=traditional+african+religions+polytheism#v=onepage&q=traditional%20african%20religions%20polytheism&f=false|title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia|last=Stanton|first=Andrea L.|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412981767|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Traditional African medicine]] is also directly linked to traditional African religions. According to Clemmont E. Vontress, the various religious traditions of Africa are united by a basic Animism. According to him, the belief in spirits and ancestors is the most important element of African religions. Gods were either self-created or evolved from spirits or ancestors which got worshiped by the people. He also notes that most modern African folk religions were strongly influenced by non-African religions, mostly Christianity and Islam and thus may differ from the ancient forms.<ref>{{Citation|last=Vontress|first=Clemmont E.|title=Animism: Foundation of Traditional Healing in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2005|url=https://sk.sagepub.com/books/integrating-traditional-healing-practices-into-counseling-and-psychotherapy/n11.xml|work=Integrating Traditional Healing Practices into Counseling and Psychotherapy|pages=124\u2013137|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|access-date=2019-10-31|doi=10.4135/9781452231648|isbn=9780761930471}}</ref>\n\n==Ceremonies==\nWest and Central African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by ''force'' (or ''ashe'', ''nyama'', etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or driving drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]] is the [[Okuyi]], practiced by several [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness.<ref name=\"Karade, B. pages 39-46\">Karade, B. ''The Handbook of Yoruba Religious Concepts'', pages&nbsp;39\u201346. Samuel Weiser Inc, 1994</ref> \n\nWhen this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech.  Also, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.<ref>Annemarie De Waal Malefijt (1968) ''Religion and Culture: an Introduction to Anthropology of Religion'', p.&nbsp;220\u2013249, Macmillan</ref>\n\n==Spirits==\n{{Main|List of African mythological figures}}\nFollowers of traditional African religions pray to various spirits as well as to their ancestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/the-spirituality-of-africa/|title=The spirituality of Africa|date=2015-10-06|website=Harvard Gazette|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> This includes also nature, elementary and animal spirits. The difference between powerful spirits and gods is often minimal. Most African societies believe in several \u201chigh gods\u201d and a large amount of lower gods and spirits.

According to Gottlieb and Mbiti: <blockquote>The environment and nature are infused in every aspect of traditional African religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become amenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs.<ref>Roger S.

The practice of casting may be done with small objects, such as bones, cowrie shells, stones, strips of leather, or flat pieces of wood.\n[[File:Sangoma reading the Bones.jpg|thumb|left|[[Traditional healers of South Africa|Traditional healer of South Africa]] performing a divination by reading the bones]]\nSome castings are done using sacred divination plates made of wood or performed on the ground (often within a circle).\n\nIn traditional African societies, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis. There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Diviner (also known as priest) are also sought for their wisdom as counselors in life and for their knowledge of herbal medicine.\n\n==Virtue and vice==\nVirtue in traditional African religion is often connected with carrying out obligations of the communal aspect of life. Examples include social behaviors such as the respect for parents and elders, raising children appropriately, providing hospitality, and being honest, trustworthy, and courageous.\n\nIn some traditional African religions, morality is associated with obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a person or a community lives. For the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], according to their primary supreme [[Creator deity|creator]], [[Ngai]], acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience.\n\nIn many cases, Africans who have converted to other religions have still kept up their traditional customs and practices, combining them in a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] way.<ref>''Resolving the Prevailing Conflicts Between Christianity and African (Igbo) Traditional Religion Through Inculturation'', by Edwin Anaegboka Udoye</ref>\n\n==Sacred places==\nSome sacred or holy locations for traditional religions include [[Nri-Igbo]], the [[Point of Sangomar]], [[Yaboyabo]], [[Fatick]], [[Ife]], [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]], [[Dahomey]], [[Benin City]], [[Ouidah]], [[Nsukka]], [[Kanem\u2013Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Igbo-Ukwu]], and Tulwap Kipsigis, among others.\n\n==Religious persecution==\n{{Main|Persecution of traditional African religion}}\n\n==Traditions by region==\nThis list is limited to a few well-known traditions.\n\n===Central Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Bushongo mythology]] (Congo)\n**[[Lugbara mythology]] (Congo)\n** [[Baluba mythology]] (Congo)\n**[[Mbuti mythology]] (Congo)\n*[[Dinka religion]] (South Sudan)\n*[[Hausa animism]] ([[Chad]], [[Gabon]])\n*[[Lotuko mythology]] (South Sudan)\n\n===East Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Gikuyu people#Culture and beliefs]] (Kenya)\n**[[Kamba people#Culture and beliefs|Akamba mythology]] (Kenya)\n*[[Maasai mythology]] (Kenya, Tanzania, Ouebian)\n*[[Kalenjin mythology]] (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania)\n*[[Dini Ya Msambwa]] (Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Kenya)\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n*[[Waaqeffanna]] (Ethiopia)\n*[[Waaqism]] (Ethiopian-Somali Region)\n\n===Southern Africa===\n*[[Bantu mythology]] (Central, Southeast, Southern Africa)\n**[[Lozi mythology]] (Zambia)\n**[[Tumbuka mythology]] (Malawi)\n**Xhosa mythology (Southern Africa)\n**[[Zulu mythology]] (South Africa)\n*[[San religion]] (South Africa)\n*[[Traditional healers of South Africa]]\n*Manjonjo Healers of Chitungwiza of Zimbabwe\n\n===West Africa===\n*[[Akan religion]] (Ghana, Ivory Coast)\n*[[Dahomean religion]] (Benin, Togo)\n*[[Efik mythology]] (Nigeria, Cameroon)\n*Edo religion (Benin kingdom, Nigeria)\n*[[Hausa animism]] (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Togo)\n*[[Odinani]] ([[Igbo people]], [[Nigeria]])\n*[[Serer religion|Serer religion (A \u01adat Roog)]] (Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania)\n*[[Yoruba religion]] (Nigeria, Benin, Togo)\n*[[West African Vodun]] (Ghana, Benin, Togo, Nigeria)\n*[[Dogon religion]] (Mali)\n\n=== African Diaspora ===\n{{Main|Afro-American religion}}\n\n===North Africa===\n*[[Ancient Egyptian religion]] (Egypt, Sudan)\n**[[Kemetism]]\n*[[Religion in Carthage|Punic Religion]] (Tunisia, Algeria, Libya)\n*[[Traditional Berber religion]] (Morocco (including Western Sahara), Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso)\n*[[Hausa animism]] ([[Sudan]])\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Information presented here was gleaned from ''World Eras Encyclopaedia'', Volume 10, edited by Pierre-Damien Mvuyekure (New York: Thomson-Gale, 2003), in particular pp.&nbsp;275\u2013314.\n*Baldick, J (1997) ''Black God: The Afroasiatic Roots of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Religions''.
