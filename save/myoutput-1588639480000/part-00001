It is said that he used to go out and invite people to come to the mosque and, on one occasion, he happened to bring [[Meo (ethnic group)|Meos]] from Mewat who were in Delhi as labourers.

Training them in the preaching work became the main activity of the madrasa, gradually turning the Banglewali Masjid into a ''markaz'' (centre or headquarters).
