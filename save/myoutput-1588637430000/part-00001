It is in [[Simcoe County]] between [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. Although it is in Simcoe County, the city is [[Independent city|politically independent]].  It is part of the [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of [[Central Ontario]]. The population in 2016 was 31,166.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nIt was incorporated as a village in 1867, but the history of what is today the City of Orillia dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Aboriginal peoples]] for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.\n\nKnown as the \"Sunshine City\", the city's large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area's largest employer is [[Casino Rama]], overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.\n\nOrillia is located on the shores of two connected lakes: [[Lake Simcoe]] and [[Lake Couchiching]]. Both lakes are part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]]. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three [[Canal lock|locks]] and the only marine railway ([[Big Chute Marine Railway]]) still in use in [[North America]] leads to [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]]. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many [[Canal lock|locks]] (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world, [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] and [[Kirkfield Lift Lock]]) eventually leads to [[Lake Ontario]]. From either of these [[Great Lakes]] one can connect to the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and thence to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:PortionofSamueldeChamplainMonumentinOrilliaOntario.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bronze monument featuring a Christian missionary holding a cross high over the heads of two North American aboriginal peoples sitting at his feet|The Christian missionary portion of the [[Samuel de Champlain]] monument designed by [[Vernon March]] in Orillia]]\n[[File:Orillia City Hall.jpg|thumb|Orillia City Hall]]\nThe human history of the area extends back several thousand years: in the \"Narrows\", a small waterway that connects [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]], there is marine [[archaeological]] evidence of ancient [[fishing weir]]s used by [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] people to trap fish over 4,000 years ago. Also, there are several archaeological sites in the surrounding area that provide evidence of trading, fishing, and hunting camps that were visited for hundreds of years by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]].\n\nAlso of historical note, the famed French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area that would later become Orillia in the summer of 1615, travelling over what would become the Coldwater Road centuries later; it was used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French and British as a fur-trading route. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster).<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>  Ecole Samuel de Champlain, a local francophone elementary school, is named in his honour. A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].\n\nThe government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815 and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans.<ref name=\"Champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe58.html |title=Champlain in Ontario, 1615\n|website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L. Brown|accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref> In 1840, the government bought extra land from the First Nations and laid out the settlement of Orillia. The population in 1846 was about 200. The settlement had a church, a post office, four stores, three taverns, a tannery, two blacksmiths, four shoemakers, a tailor, and two furniture makers. A grist mill could be found about a mile away.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Construction of the Monck Road began in 1866 and was completed in 1873. A 100-mile stretch allowed for travel to [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]], Ontario where other roads could be found for travel to Ottawa.<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>\n\nTransportation links with Toronto and Georgian Bay stimulated Orillia's development as a commercial centre and summer resort.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/plaques/founding-of-orillia |title=Founding of Orillia |publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust|accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref>\nThe [[village]] of Orillia was incorporated in 1867 (sharing the same birth year as [[Canada]]). By 1875 the population was 2,000 and Orillia became a town with a mayor, reeve, deputy reeve, and nine councillors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orillia.ca/en/city-hall/history.aspx |title=History | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\nOrillia was designated a [[city]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orillia.ca/en/city-hall/municipalheritagecommitteehome.aspx |title=Heritage Home Page | publisher=City of Orillia | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Stephen Leacock]]'s 1912 book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'', Orillia was used as the basis for the fictional town known as \"Mariposa\", although Leacock stated that the fictional town could really be any town. The book was based on Leacock's experiences in the town and since the book's release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible. The Leacock Museum and National Historic Site, located in Orillia, is one of the [[National Historic Sites of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicplacesday.ca/places/leacock-museum-national-historic-site/ |title=Leacock Museum National Historic Site | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[William E. Bell (author)|William E. Bell's]] 1989 novel ''Five Days of the Ghost'' was also set in Orillia, with many readers recognizing popular local spots, including the Guardian Angels Catholic Church, the [[Samuel de Champlain]] statue in [[Couchiching Beach Park]] as well as [[Big Chief Island]] in the middle of [[Lake Couchiching]].\n\nOrillia was the first municipality in North America to introduce [[daylight saving time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/07/08/bold-attempt-at-daylight-saving-time-became-a-comic-failure-in-orillia.html |title=Bold attempt at daylight saving time became a comic failure in Orillia|publisher=Toronto Star | date=8 July 2017 | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref> and had the first municipal hydroelectric transmission plant<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM52FB_FIRST_HYDRO_ELECTRIC_PLANT__Orillia_Ontario_CANADA |title=FIRST HYDRO-ELECTRIC PLANT - Orillia, Ontario CANADA | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref> in North America.\n\n===Etymology===\nThe first recorded use of the name to describe the region, which until then had no officially sanctioned designation, was in 1820 when the name was given in [[Toronto|York]], [[Upper Canada]] by then [[Lieutenant-Governors of Ontario|Lieutenant-Governor]] Sir [[Peregrine Maitland]]. Maitland was a veteran of the [[United Kingdom|British]] campaign against the [[First French Empire|French]] in [[Spain]], called the [[Peninsular War]], during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] where he served under the command of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].\n\nWhile there are no records clearly indicating the reason for the name Orillia, the most common explanation holds that the name originates in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"orilla,\" which can mean the shore of either a lake or river. The Spanish pronunciation sounds much like, \"oreeya,\" and since the word itself is spelled almost identically to Orillia, without the second, \"i,\" it has come to be commonly accepted as the source word for the city's name. Further backing the theory of a Spanish origin are the names of surrounding communities and landmarks, which include [[Oro-Medonte|Oro]] for [[gold]], [[Mariposa, Ontario|Mariposa]] for [[butterfly]], and [[Mono, Ontario|Mono]] for [[monkey]]. Historical documents contain a second spelling of the name which was never officially recognised, Aurelia, which when pronounced sounds similar to the name and is considered a [[clerical error]].<ref>Why Call it That? by Ross McDonald, published by the Orillia Historical Society.

Subsequently, Orillia's economics has ranged from farming (even downtown) to machinery, to automobiles and even one of the first \"campers\" (a pop-up tent in a car).\n\nEconomic activity in Orillia is a mix of manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism. The largest employer in the area is [[Casino Rama]], located in the nearby [[Indian reserve|reserve]] land of the [[Chippewas of Rama First Nation]]. Manufacturing operations in the city include CCI Thermal Technologies (industrial heaters and heating components), Dorr-Oliver Eimco (industrial equipment), Kubota Metal Corporation ([[petrochemical industry]] components), [[Parker Hannifin]] (moulded rubber products), Pliant Corporation (components for the packaging industry), Smiths Aerospace Components (aerospace industry machining) and TI Group Automotive Systems (automotive components). Call centre Tele Tech Canada also employs approximately 850 people. The Central Operations Headquarters for Ontario Provincial Police is located in Orillia (Memorial Drive), as is the regional headquarters.\n\nHeywood-Wakefield seating, which operated from the early 20th century, announced it was closing its doors in September 2007. In late July 2009, Parker Hannifin announced that they were shutting down their operations in Orillia at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandmirror.com/midlandmirror/article/142346|title=Simcoe County Breaking News - Simcoe County's Online Newspaper - Simcoe.com|website=Simcoe.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nG.W.B. Rope & Twine, which was one of the foremost North American producers of braided rope from 1973 to 1985, was also the inventor of the automotive grocery or cargo restraint net. The net was introduced with the launch of the Ford Taurus at Christmas 1985, and shortly thereafter the company was sold and became Polytech Netting Industries, which employed several hundred people until moving to Mexico in 1996\u201397. G.W.B. Rope and Twine's founders, Gordon W. Brown and family, launched G&B Ropes in 1990. (Their son Sean Brown worked with G&B Ropes until it transferred ownership around 1998. Sean Brown then assisted in the development of Orillia's newest rope-making business, Redpoint Ropes.)\n\nLarge public-sector employers include the headquarters for the [[Ontario Provincial Police]], which is located in Orillia. The [[Huronia Regional Centre]], formerly an asylum that later became an institution to house disabled people, was one of the area's largest employers for many decades until the de-institutionalization movement of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n==Recreation and culture==\nOrillia is known as the \"Sunshine City\", taking the moniker from its role as the fictional \"Mariposa\" in the book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'' by [[Stephen Leacock]]. Many local businesses also use \"Mariposa\" in their names.\n\nThe city council has actively restricted the construction of large buildings downtown and seeks to maintain a certain \"small town\" look with regard to signs and decorations. However, in 2017 plans were further discussed to redevelop the waterfront district and other areas underdeveloped or otherwise vacant. A 3D model was developed at the local Royal Canadian Legion to reflect the possible future and is to be on display in city hall.\n[[Image:Stephen Leacock House Orillia.jpg|thumb|left|Leacock Museum and National Historic Site]]\n\nOrillia's \"Arts District\" is located on Peter St. S., between Mississauga St. E. and Colborne St. E. and is home to a variety of art galleries, fine dining and shops. At its centre is the Orillia Museum of Art & History, considered the hub of art and culture for the city, playing an instrumental role in municipal cultural events.\n\nThe museum occupies all four floors of the historic Sir Sam Steele Building, a landmark destination for both residents and visitors. A collection of over 10,000 artefacts of regional historical significance features in a rotating exhibits schedule. On a separate floor is contemporary art space with exhibits featuring regional and international artists. The museum also features a designated education space and hosts activities including art-making and interpretive programming for children, artists, artisans, historians, etc.\n\nMany tourists and boaters are attracted to the city each year because of its waterfront park Couchiching Beach Park/Centennial Park/Port of Orillia and its position as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in [[Muskoka]], [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] and other natural attractions. The city's waterfront has an extensive lakeshore boardwalk, a large park with two beaches, several playgrounds, an outdoor theatre, a touring ferry, and a children's train.\n\nThe city of Orillia also is home to a large number of retirement homes (currently nine, with four more under construction). As such, it is often characterized as a \"retirement community\", although less than 18% of the city's population is actually over 65 (see below).\n\nOrillia is home to an annual Perch Fishing Festival. Perch are netted, tagged, and released into the local lake, to be caught for prize money. This event also includes a large social gathering consisting of a \"perch fry\". Other popular annual festivals include the Leacock Festival, Blues Festival, Jazz Festival, Scottish Festival, and Beatles Festival.\n\nThe Port of Orillia holds an annual \"Christmas in June\", which includes a boat decorating contest and turkey buffet. Boat and cottage shows are held in June and August.\n\nOrillia also hosts an annual Canada Day event at Couchiching Beach Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orilliacanadaday.ca/|title=Orillia Canada Day|access-date= 10 August 2019}}</ref> The day begins with a traditional pancake breakfast served by the Mayor and Council, and ends with a large fireworks display at dusk.\n\nOrillia is the original and current site of the popular [[Mariposa Folk Festival]]. Beginning in 1961, this festival is the longest running folk festival in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariposafolk.com/the-foundation/history/|title=History - Mariposa Folk Foundation|work=Mariposa Folk Foundation|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Stephen Leacock Associates have honoured former Orillia resident and humourist [[Stephen Leacock]]'s memory since 1947 with the annual [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]], awarded to the best Canadian humorous book published the previous year.  The Leacock Medal Gala and Award ceremony is held each June at nearby Geneva Park, with tickets for sale to the public.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Legion]] sponsors a yearly Scottish Festival at Couchiching Beach Park and Centennial Park in July each year.

It is in [[Simcoe County]] between [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. Although it is in Simcoe County, the city is [[Independent city|politically independent]].  It is part of the [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of [[Central Ontario]]. The population in 2016 was 31,166.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nIt was incorporated as a village in 1867, but the history of what is today the City of Orillia dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Aboriginal peoples]] for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.\n\nKnown as the \"Sunshine City\", the city's large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area's largest employer is [[Casino Rama]], overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.\n\nOrillia is located on the shores of two connected lakes: [[Lake Simcoe]] and [[Lake Couchiching]]. Both lakes are part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]]. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three [[Canal lock|locks]] and the only marine railway ([[Big Chute Marine Railway]]) still in use in [[North America]] leads to [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]]. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many [[Canal lock|locks]] (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world, [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] and [[Kirkfield Lift Lock]]) eventually leads to [[Lake Ontario]]. From either of these [[Great Lakes]] one can connect to the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and thence to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:PortionofSamueldeChamplainMonumentinOrilliaOntario.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bronze monument featuring a Christian missionary holding a cross high over the heads of two North American aboriginal peoples sitting at his feet|The Christian missionary portion of the [[Samuel de Champlain]] monument designed by [[Vernon March]] in Orillia]]\n[[File:Orillia City Hall.jpg|thumb|Orillia City Hall]]\nThe human history of the area extends back several thousand years: in the \"Narrows\", a small waterway that connects [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]], there is marine [[archaeological]] evidence of ancient [[fishing weir]]s used by [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] people to trap fish over 4,000 years ago. Also, there are several archaeological sites in the surrounding area that provide evidence of trading, fishing, and hunting camps that were visited for hundreds of years by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]].\n\nAlso of historical note, the famed French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area that would later become Orillia in the summer of 1615, travelling over what would become the Coldwater Road centuries later; it was used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French and British as a fur-trading route. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster).<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>  Ecole Samuel de Champlain, a local francophone elementary school, is named in his honour. A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].\n\nThe government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815 and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans.<ref name=\"Champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe58.html |title=Champlain in Ontario, 1615\n|website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L.

The settlement had a church, a post office, four stores, three taverns, a tannery, two blacksmiths, four shoemakers, a tailor, and two furniture makers.

The book was based on Leacock's experiences in the town and since the book's release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible. The Leacock Museum and National Historic Site, located in Orillia, is one of the [[National Historic Sites of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicplacesday.ca/places/leacock-museum-national-historic-site/ |title=Leacock Museum National Historic Site | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[William E.

Maitland was a veteran of the [[United Kingdom|British]] campaign against the [[First French Empire|French]] in [[Spain]], called the [[Peninsular War]], during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] where he served under the command of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].\n\nWhile there are no records clearly indicating the reason for the name Orillia, the most common explanation holds that the name originates in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"orilla,\" which can mean the shore of either a lake or river. The Spanish pronunciation sounds much like, \"oreeya,\" and since the word itself is spelled almost identically to Orillia, without the second, \"i,\" it has come to be commonly accepted as the source word for the city's name. Further backing the theory of a Spanish origin are the names of surrounding communities and landmarks, which include [[Oro-Medonte|Oro]] for [[gold]], [[Mariposa, Ontario|Mariposa]] for [[butterfly]], and [[Mono, Ontario|Mono]] for [[monkey]]. Historical documents contain a second spelling of the name which was never officially recognised, Aurelia, which when pronounced sounds similar to the name and is considered a [[clerical error]].<ref>Why Call it That? by Ross McDonald, published by the Orillia Historical Society.

The city has experienced growth for the past fifteen years, with a population increase of over 2,000 residents (7.0 percent) since the 2001 census. The median household income in 2015 for Orillia was $55,802, which is below the Ontario provincial average of $74,287.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\n==Government==\nOrillia is governed by the [[Orillia City Council]], which consists of eight city councillors and a mayor.\n\nThere are four wards in the city.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1969 the council was led by a reeve or mayor. Since 1969 the head of the council is the mayor.\n\n==Grape Island==\n\n'''Grape Island''' is a lake island located off Victoria Point in the north end of [[Lake Simcoe]].\n\nToday the island is occupied by about 40 private homes or cottages and residences are part of the ''Grape Island Property Owners Association'' (c. 1952).<ref name=\"GrapeIs\">{{cite news |url=https://www.orilliamatters.com/local-news/councils-grape-island-decision-not-fair-to-anyone-820211 |title=Council's Grape Island decision 'not fair to anyone' |date=January 23, 2018|first=Dave |last=Dawson |website=OrilliaMatters.com |accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref> Access is restricted to residents of the island with access by boat from Forest Avenue South dock to private docks on the island.<ref name=\"GrapeIs\"/> The heavy traffic at the mainland docks have resulted in tensions between island residents and residents of Victoria Point.<ref name=\"GrapeIs\"/> The city of Orillia is working on finding a solution for access to the island without inconveniencing residents in Victoria Point.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bayshorebroadcasting.ca/news_item.php?NewsID=104117 |title=Search for New Location for Grape Island Dock |date=September 11, 2018 |first=Ken |last=Hashizume |publisher=Bayshore Broadcasting |accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are no vehicular roads on the island.

Subsequently, Orillia's economics has ranged from farming (even downtown) to machinery, to automobiles and even one of the first \"campers\" (a pop-up tent in a car).\n\nEconomic activity in Orillia is a mix of manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism. The largest employer in the area is [[Casino Rama]], located in the nearby [[Indian reserve|reserve]] land of the [[Chippewas of Rama First Nation]]. Manufacturing operations in the city include CCI Thermal Technologies (industrial heaters and heating components), Dorr-Oliver Eimco (industrial equipment), Kubota Metal Corporation ([[petrochemical industry]] components), [[Parker Hannifin]] (moulded rubber products), Pliant Corporation (components for the packaging industry), Smiths Aerospace Components (aerospace industry machining) and TI Group Automotive Systems (automotive components). Call centre Tele Tech Canada also employs approximately 850 people. The Central Operations Headquarters for Ontario Provincial Police is located in Orillia (Memorial Drive), as is the regional headquarters.\n\nHeywood-Wakefield seating, which operated from the early 20th century, announced it was closing its doors in September 2007. In late July 2009, Parker Hannifin announced that they were shutting down their operations in Orillia at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandmirror.com/midlandmirror/article/142346|title=Simcoe County Breaking News - Simcoe County's Online Newspaper - Simcoe.com|website=Simcoe.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nG.W.B. Rope & Twine, which was one of the foremost North American producers of braided rope from 1973 to 1985, was also the inventor of the automotive grocery or cargo restraint net. The net was introduced with the launch of the Ford Taurus at Christmas 1985, and shortly thereafter the company was sold and became Polytech Netting Industries, which employed several hundred people until moving to Mexico in 1996\u201397. G.W.B. Rope and Twine's founders, Gordon W. Brown and family, launched G&B Ropes in 1990. (Their son Sean Brown worked with G&B Ropes until it transferred ownership around 1998. Sean Brown then assisted in the development of Orillia's newest rope-making business, Redpoint Ropes.)\n\nLarge public-sector employers include the headquarters for the [[Ontario Provincial Police]], which is located in Orillia. The [[Huronia Regional Centre]], formerly an asylum that later became an institution to house disabled people, was one of the area's largest employers for many decades until the de-institutionalization movement of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n==Recreation and culture==\nOrillia is known as the \"Sunshine City\", taking the moniker from its role as the fictional \"Mariposa\" in the book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'' by [[Stephen Leacock]]. Many local businesses also use \"Mariposa\" in their names.\n\nThe city council has actively restricted the construction of large buildings downtown and seeks to maintain a certain \"small town\" look with regard to signs and decorations. However, in 2017 plans were further discussed to redevelop the waterfront district and other areas underdeveloped or otherwise vacant. A 3D model was developed at the local Royal Canadian Legion to reflect the possible future and is to be on display in city hall.\n[[Image:Stephen Leacock House Orillia.jpg|thumb|left|Leacock Museum and National Historic Site]]\n\nOrillia's \"Arts District\" is located on Peter St. S., between Mississauga St. E. and Colborne St. E. and is home to a variety of art galleries, fine dining and shops. At its centre is the Orillia Museum of Art & History, considered the hub of art and culture for the city, playing an instrumental role in municipal cultural events.\n\nThe museum occupies all four floors of the historic Sir Sam Steele Building, a landmark destination for both residents and visitors. A collection of over 10,000 artefacts of regional historical significance features in a rotating exhibits schedule. On a separate floor is contemporary art space with exhibits featuring regional and international artists. The museum also features a designated education space and hosts activities including art-making and interpretive programming for children, artists, artisans, historians, etc.\n\nMany tourists and boaters are attracted to the city each year because of its waterfront park Couchiching Beach Park/Centennial Park/Port of Orillia and its position as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in [[Muskoka]], [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] and other natural attractions. The city's waterfront has an extensive lakeshore boardwalk, a large park with two beaches, several playgrounds, an outdoor theatre, a touring ferry, and a children's train.\n\nThe city of Orillia also is home to a large number of retirement homes (currently nine, with four more under construction). As such, it is often characterized as a \"retirement community\", although less than 18% of the city's population is actually over 65 (see below).\n\nOrillia is home to an annual Perch Fishing Festival. Perch are netted, tagged, and released into the local lake, to be caught for prize money. This event also includes a large social gathering consisting of a \"perch fry\". Other popular annual festivals include the Leacock Festival, Blues Festival, Jazz Festival, Scottish Festival, and Beatles Festival.\n\nThe Port of Orillia holds an annual \"Christmas in June\", which includes a boat decorating contest and turkey buffet. Boat and cottage shows are held in June and August.\n\nOrillia also hosts an annual Canada Day event at Couchiching Beach Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orilliacanadaday.ca/|title=Orillia Canada Day|access-date= 10 August 2019}}</ref> The day begins with a traditional pancake breakfast served by the Mayor and Council, and ends with a large fireworks display at dusk.\n\nOrillia is the original and current site of the popular [[Mariposa Folk Festival]]. Beginning in 1961, this festival is the longest running folk festival in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariposafolk.com/the-foundation/history/|title=History - Mariposa Folk Foundation|work=Mariposa Folk Foundation|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Stephen Leacock Associates have honoured former Orillia resident and humourist [[Stephen Leacock]]'s memory since 1947 with the annual [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]], awarded to the best Canadian humorous book published the previous year.  The Leacock Medal Gala and Award ceremony is held each June at nearby Geneva Park, with tickets for sale to the public.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Legion]] sponsors a yearly Scottish Festival at Couchiching Beach Park and Centennial Park in July each year. Marching bands from around the country participate.\n\nSince 1963, the [[Webers]] hamburger restaurant has been approximately 1&nbsp;km north of Orillia,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Webers+Restaurant/@44.6940158,-79.3988699,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4d2aa6784cfe299f:0x759e8003df69dd60|title=Webers Location Google Maps|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref> next to [[Ontario Highway 11]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.readersdigest.ca/food/bbq/canadas-8-greatest-burger-restaurants?id=2|title=Canada's 8 Greatest Burger Restaurants|last=Sue Campbell & Jen McMorran|work=[[Reader's Digest]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/1236157--the-dish-on-cottage-country-s-famous-foodie-treats-burgers-to-butter-tarts|title=The dish on cottage country\u2019s famous foodie treats: burgers to butter tarts|last=Ogilvie|first=Megan|date=3 August 2012|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nLake St. George Golf Club is ten minutes north of Orillia.\n\n==Education==\nBoth French and English public education is offered in Orillia.\n\nThere is one Catholic French-language elementary school, ''\u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Samuel-de-Champlain'', operated by the [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]].<ref>[http://www.sdc.csdccs.edu.on.ca \u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Samuel-de-Champlain]</ref>\n\nStudents from this elementary school attend ''\u00c9cole secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance'', which is operated by the same board and is located in Barrie.<ref>[http://www.escna.csdccs.edu.on.ca \u00c9cole secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance]</ref>\n\nEnglish public education in Orillia is provided via the [[Simcoe County District School Board]], which has nine elementary and three secondary schools in the city.
