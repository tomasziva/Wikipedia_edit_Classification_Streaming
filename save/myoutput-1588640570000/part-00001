Please do NOT change \"ARE\" to \"IS\". Thank you. --> an English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in 1976 in [[Stourbridge]], England. The band is recognised as one of the leading members of the [[new wave of British heavy metal|new wave of British heavy metal movement]] and is acknowledged by [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] as an important early influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/DHpresspack.htm |title=Diamond Head Press Pack |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220120255/http://www.diamond-head.net/DHpresspack.htm |archivedate=20 December 2012  }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nTwo working class teenagers from [[Stourbridge]] created the band in 1976. The band recorded self-financed demo tapes in 1979. Recorded within six hours on a four-track, their unique sound and quality of writing gained enough attention for the band to tour as support to [[AC/DC]] and [[Iron Maiden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/gigs/gig250180.htm |title=Supporting ACDC |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233034/http://www.diamond-head.net/gigs/gig250180.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013  }}</ref> Although several record companies expressed interests in signing the band, no contracts were forthcoming. The band was at the time managed by Reg Fellows and Sean Harris' mother (Linda Harris), who reportedly turned down an offer from the influential Leiber/Krebs Management.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/article2004-02.jpg |title=Am I Evil? |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828024955/http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/article2004-02.jpg |archivedate=28 August 2012  }}</ref> Thus while other new wave of British heavy metal bands were signed to major labels and headlining their own tours, Diamond Head remained independent. The management decided that they would release their material through a label owned by Muff Murfin called 'Happy Face Records'. Murfin also owned the studio where Diamond Head did many of their early recordings.\n\nTheir first release was the 1979 single \"[[Shoot Out the Lights (song)|Shoot Out The Lights]]\" (b/w ''Helpless''); their second single \"[[Sweet and Innocent (Diamond Head song)|Sweet and Innocent]]\" (b/w \"Streets of Gold\") was released by Media Records in 1980.\n\nThat same year the band also recorded their debut album on Happy Face. Most commonly known as ''[[Lightning to the Nations]]'', the collection was recorded in seven days at The Old Smythy Studio in [[Worcester]], which the band described later as 'dead'.<ref>Kollektor's Klassik 3, pp16</ref> The album was packaged in a plain sleeve with no title or track listings, simply bearing a signature of one of the band members. The management thought that it should be perceived as a 'demo' album so no fancy sleeve was required, making it very cheap to produce. The first 1000 copies were pressed and made available at concerts or via mail-order for \u00a33.50. The only mail-order [[advertisement]] appeared in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' and ran for six weeks. The band's management did not pay for the advertisement and ended up being sued. The idea for recording this album came from Fellows and Linda Harris as an attempt to record tracks to entice attention from a record company, which would take care of the recording costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF3.jpg |title=News Article |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207145402/http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF3.jpg |archivedate=7 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\nThe original stereo master tapes were lost after they were sent to the German record company, Woolfe Records, who released a vinyl version of the album with a new sleeve. The tapes were not returned until they were eventually tracked down by Lars Ulrich and Phonogram Germany for inclusion on the 1990 compilation album 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited'.\n\n===''Borrowed Time''===\nThe buzz surrounding the band's live shows eventually led to a record deal with [[MCA Records]] in 1982, and rush released the ''[[Four Cuts EP]]'', which contained two early era songs ''Shoot Out The Lights'' and ''Dead Reckoning''. Their new status afforded them a slot on the Reading festival bill in 1982, albeit as late and unadvertised replacements for [[Manowar]]. Their set was recorded by the [[BBC]] and later released in 1992 through Raw Fruit Records as the ''[[The Friday Rock Show Sessions / Live at Reading|Friday Rock Show Sessions]]''.\n\nTheir first MCA album, ''[[Borrowed Time (Diamond Head album)|Borrowed Time]]'', featured a lavish [[Rodney Matthews]]-illustrated gatefold sleeve based on the album's [[Elric]] theme and was the most expensive sleeve commissioned by MCA at the time. The album was somewhat successful commercially, climbing to No.&nbsp;24 in the UK album charts, but the band's more commercial sound on the album made it a disappointment to critics. The band were able to perform a full scale UK tour at premier venues such as London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]], however.\n\nTo support the album Diamond Head's sixth single \"In the Heat of the Night\", backed with live versions of ''Play it Loud'' and ''Sweet and Innocent'' recorded at the Zig-Zag club, and an interview with [[DJ]] [[Tommy Vance]] (although the latter was not available on the 12\").\n\nThe band tried a more experimental sounding follow-up to ''Borrowed Time'', tentatively titled ''Making Music'' which later became ''[[Canterbury (album)|Canterbury]]'' in 1983. The initial success of the album was stalled as the first 20,000 copies suffered vinyl pressing problems, causing the LP to jump.\n\nIn 1993 the band released ''[[Death and Progress]]'' featuring guest contributions by [[Tony Iommi]] of [[Black Sabbath]] and Dave Mustaine. The band's reunion was short lived as they were on the verge of splitting up as soon as the record was released.\n\n===2000s===\n\nIn 2003 Diamond Head and Sean Harris finally went their separate ways. Although Harris issued a press release on Blabbermouth.net <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=26247 |title=Ex Diamond Head Singer Says He Was 'Shocked' By Announcement He Was Fired From Band \u2013 Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225856/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=26247 |archivedate=6 June 2011  }}</ref> that said that as far as he was concerned he had as much right over the Diamond Head name as anyone else, and that as far he was concerned he was still in the band.\n\n===Nick Tart era===\n[[File:Nick Tart.jpg|125px|right|Nick Tart & [[Brian Tatler]] at The Astoria, London, 2005]] \n\nThe band's next album, ''[[All Will Be Revealed]]'' (the title apparently referring to Sean Harris), was released in 2005 and was very different from their early material. To promote this album they toured with [[Megadeth]]. Brian Tatler commented that this was one of the best experiences of his life and regained his enjoyment playing live with the band again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/article45.htm |title=Metal Invader \u2013 Diamond Head Interview |publisher=Diamond-head.net |date=19 October 2005 |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212205435/http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/article45.htm |archivedate=12 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\nDiamond Head headlined a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the NWOBHM at the [[London Astoria]], supported by [[Witchfynde]], [[Bronz]], [[Praying Mantis (band)|Praying Mantis]] and [[Jaguar (band)|Jaguar]].

Colin Kimberley commented Diamond Head got their complex sound from listening to bands like [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and realising that a song with a single riff throughout was not interesting enough.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF2.jpg |title=News Article |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207145352/http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF2.jpg |archivedate=7 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\nIn a recent interview Tatler stated that he now tries not to be influenced by modern bands and keep his sound, although he imagines that \"little bits creep into the writing process.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getreadytoroll.com/interviews/briantatler.htm |title=getreadytoroll.com |publisher=getreadytoroll.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Lack of success==\nMany reasons have been cited why Diamond Head never achieved significant commercial success. That they changed musical direction with ''[[Canterbury (album)|Canterbury]]'' and that they did not attain a record deal soon enough are two main reasons. Once they did sign to a major label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] proved to be the wrong label, forcing the band to sound more commercial.<ref>''Survivors'', Classic rock Vol.124, pg57</ref> Also, while bands like [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Def Leppard]] were managed by established music management, Diamond Head were managed by Reg Fellows and the lead singer's mother. \n\nDiamond Head should have toured the United States in the 1980s when lots of their NWOBHM brethren had already made inroads. Diamond Head did not set foot on US soil until 2002 performing one show at a New Jersey Metal Festival. It also did not help that the band did not stick to a style and give it chance to succeed before trying something new, constantly searching for a winning formula.\n\nThen later they had problems with a viable comeback, with problems associated with the [[National Bowl]] gig with [[Metallica]] and the lack of desire from Sean Harris to carry on performing [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\n\n==Influence on Metallica==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}\nDiamond Head are probably most famous among heavy metal fans for their influence on [[Metallica]]. Metallica have acknowledged them as an important early influence and have covered Diamond Head songs at gigs such as \"Sucking My Love\", \"Am I Evil?\" and \"The Prince.\" The earliest known recordings of these songs are a rehearsal demo recorded at then-bassist [[Ron McGovney]]'s house in March 1982. The ''[[Metal Up Your Ass]]'' live demo, recorded in November of that year, featured a live rendition of \"Am I Evil?\".  \"The Prince\" was also played, but the tape ran out too soon to catch it. \"Sucking My Love\" exists on various [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] that have been circulating since 1982 along with a recording on the early demo ''No Life Til Leather''.\n\nThe first official release of \"Am I Evil?\" came in 1984 as part of the ''[[Creeping Death]]''12\" single paired with another NWOBHM classic \"Blitzkrieg\", by the [[Blitzkrieg (heavy metal band)|band of the same name]]. The two songs were also included in the first pressing of the ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' [[Gramophone record|LP]] when it was re-released by [[Elektra Records]].\n\n\"Helpless\" would be released with ''[[The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited|The $5.98 EP: Garage Days Re-Revisited]]'' in 1987 and \"The Prince\" was included as a B-side to the \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" single.\n\nDuring the [[Wherever We May Roam Tour]] Metallica played \"Am I Evil?\" and \"Helpless\" with the original band members on 5 November 1992 at [[NEC Arena]] in [[Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M8F0LBweQY |title=Metallica \u2013 Am I Evil / Helpless with Diamond Head \u2013 Birmingham 1992 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official recordings of \"Am I Evil?\", \"Helpless\" and \"The Prince\" would also be featured on [[Metallica]]'s 2-CD ''[[Garage Inc.]]'' compilation, a collection of numerous cover songs that the band had played over the years. The first CD in the set was newly recorded covers, one of which was Diamond Head's \"It's Electric\".\n\nMetallica performed \"Am I Evil?\" along with the other bands in the Big 4 ([[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Slayer]]) at the 2011 Sonisphere festival, and with Diamond Head themselves at the Sonisphere festival in Knebworth on 8 July 2011. Lars Ulrich said that there was \"a pretty good chance that none of us would be here\" without Brian Tatler before playing the song. The following day Brian performed \"Helpless\" with Metallica and Anthrax at the Sonisphere festival in ''[[Amn\u00e9ville, France]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diamond-head.net/DHnews129.htm |title=Diamond Head Homepage |publisher=Diamond-head.net |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 December 2011 Brian Tatler and Sean Harris joined Metallica onstage at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco to celebrate Metallica's 30th Anniversary. Together they played \"The Prince\", \"It's Electric\", \"Helpless\" and \"Am I Evil?\". Tatler and Harris also took part in a group encore of \"Seek and Destroy\".

The band is recognised as one of the leading members of the [[new wave of British heavy metal|new wave of British heavy metal movement]] and is acknowledged by [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] as an important early influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/DHpresspack.htm |title=Diamond Head Press Pack |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220120255/http://www.diamond-head.net/DHpresspack.htm |archivedate=20 December 2012  }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nTwo working class teenagers from [[Stourbridge]] created the band in 1976. The band recorded self-financed demo tapes in 1979. Recorded within six hours on a four-track, their unique sound and quality of writing gained enough attention for the band to tour as support to [[AC/DC]] and [[Iron Maiden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/gigs/gig250180.htm |title=Supporting ACDC |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233034/http://www.diamond-head.net/gigs/gig250180.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013  }}</ref> Although several record companies expressed interests in signing the band, no contracts were forthcoming. The band was at the time managed by Reg Fellows and Sean Harris' mother (Linda Harris), who reportedly turned down an offer from the influential Leiber/Krebs Management.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/article2004-02.jpg |title=Am I Evil? |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828024955/http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/article2004-02.jpg |archivedate=28 August 2012  }}</ref> Thus while other new wave of British heavy metal bands were signed to major labels and headlining their own tours, Diamond Head remained independent. The management decided that they would release their material through a label owned by Muff Murfin called 'Happy Face Records'. Murfin also owned the studio where Diamond Head did many of their early recordings.\n\nTheir first release was the 1979 single \"[[Shoot Out the Lights (song)|Shoot Out The Lights]]\" (b/w ''Helpless''); their second single \"[[Sweet and Innocent (Diamond Head song)|Sweet and Innocent]]\" (b/w \"Streets of Gold\") was released by Media Records in 1980.\n\nThat same year the band also recorded their debut album on Happy Face. Most commonly known as ''[[Lightning to the Nations]]'', the collection was recorded in seven days at The Old Smythy Studio in [[Worcester]], which the band described later as 'dead'.<ref>Kollektor's Klassik 3, pp16</ref> The album was packaged in a plain sleeve with no title or track listings, simply bearing a signature of one of the band members. The management thought that it should be perceived as a 'demo' album so no fancy sleeve was required, making it very cheap to produce. The first 1000 copies were pressed and made available at concerts or via mail-order for \u00a33.50. The only mail-order [[advertisement]] appeared in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' and ran for six weeks. The bands management did not pay for the advertisement and ended up being sued. The idea for recording this album came from Fellows and Linda Harris as an attempt to record tracks to entice attention from a record company, which would take care of the recording costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF3.jpg |title=News Article |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207145402/http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF3.jpg |archivedate=7 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\nThe original stereo master tapes were lost after they were sent to the German record company, Woolfe Records, who released a vinyl version of the album with a new sleeve. The tapes were not returned until they were eventually tracked down by Lars Ulrich and Phonogram Germany for inclusion on the 1990 compilation album 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited'.\n\n===''Borrowed Time''===\nThe buzz surrounding the band's live shows eventually led to a record deal with [[MCA Records]] in 1982, and rush released the ''[[Four Cuts EP]]'', which contained two early era songs ''Shoot Out The Lights'' and ''Dead Reckoning''. Their new status afforded them a slot on the Reading festival bill in 1982, albeit as late and unadvertised replacements for [[Manowar]]. Their set was recorded by the [[BBC]] and later released in 1992 through Raw Fruit Records as the ''[[The Friday Rock Show Sessions / Live at Reading|Friday Rock Show Sessions]]''.\n\nTheir first MCA album, ''[[Borrowed Time (Diamond Head album)|Borrowed Time]]'', featured a lavish [[Rodney Matthews]]-illustrated gatefold sleeve based on the album's [[Elric]] theme and was the most expensive sleeve commissioned by MCA at the time. The album was somewhat successful commercially, climbing to No.&nbsp;24 in the UK album charts, but the band's more commercial sound on the album made it a disappointment to critics. The band were able to perform a full scale UK tour at premier venues such as London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]], however.\n\nTo support the album Diamond Head's sixth single \"In the Heat of the Night\", backed with live versions of ''Play it Loud'' and ''Sweet and Innocent'' recorded at the Zig-Zag club, and an interview with [[DJ]] [[Tommy Vance]] (although the latter was not available on the 12\").\n\nThe band tried a more experimental sounding follow-up to ''Borrowed Time'', tentatively titled ''Making Music'' which later became ''[[Canterbury (album)|Canterbury]]'' in 1983. The initial success of the album was stalled as the first 20,000 copies suffered vinyl pressing problems, causing the LP to jump.\n\nIn 1993 the band released ''[[Death and Progress]]'' featuring guest contributions by [[Tony Iommi]] of [[Black Sabbath]] and Dave Mustaine. The band's reunion was short lived as they were on the verge of splitting up as soon as the record was released.\n\n===2000s===\n\nIn 2003 Diamond Head and Sean Harris finally went their separate ways.

To promote this album they toured with [[Megadeth]].

Colin Kimberley commented Diamond Head got their complex sound from listening to bands like [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and realising that a song with a single riff throughout was not interesting enough.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF2.jpg |title=News Article |publisher=Diamond-head.net |accessdate=28 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207145352/http://www.diamond-head.net/newsarticles/HOF2.jpg |archivedate=7 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\nIn a recent interview Tatler stated that he now tries not to be influenced by modern bands and keep his sound, although he imagines that \"little bits creep into the writing process.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getreadytoroll.com/interviews/briantatler.htm |title=getreadytoroll.com |publisher=getreadytoroll.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Lack of success==\nMany reasons have been cited why Diamond Head never achieved significant commercial success. That they changed musical direction with ''[[Canterbury (album)|Canterbury]]'' and that they did not attain a record deal soon enough are two main reasons. Once they did sign to a major label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] proved to be the wrong label, forcing the band to sound more commercial.<ref>''Survivors'', Classic rock Vol.124, pg57</ref> Also, while bands like [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Def Leppard]] were managed by established music management, Diamond Head were managed by Reg Fellows and the lead singer's mother. \n\nDiamond Head should have toured the United States in the 1980s when lots of their NWOBHM brethren had already made inroads. Diamond Head did not set foot on US soil until 2002 performing one show at a New Jersey Metal Festival. It also did not help that the band did not stick to a style and give it chance to succeed before trying something new, constantly searching for a winning formula.\n\nThen later they had problems with a viable comeback, with problems associated with the [[National Bowl]] gig with [[Metallica]] and the lack of desire from Sean Harris to carry on performing [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\n\n==Influence on Metallica==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}\nDiamond Head are probably most famous among heavy metal fans for their influence on [[Metallica]]. Metallica have acknowledged them as an important early influence and have covered Diamond Head songs at gigs such as \"Sucking My Love\", \"Am I Evil?\" and \"The Prince.\" The earliest known recordings of these songs are a rehearsal demo recorded at then-bassist [[Ron McGovney]]'s house in March 1982. The ''[[Metal Up Your Ass]]'' live demo, recorded in November of that year, featured a live rendition of \"Am I Evil?\".  \"The Prince\" was also played, but the tape ran out too soon to catch it. \"Sucking My Love\" exists on various [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] that have been circulating since 1982 along with a recording on the early demo ''No Life Til Leather''.\n\nThe first official release of \"Am I Evil?\" came in 1984 as part of the ''[[Creeping Death]]''12\" single paired with another NWOBHM classic \"Blitzkrieg\", by the [[Blitzkrieg (heavy metal band)|band of the same name]]. The two songs were also included in the first pressing of the ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' [[Gramophone record|LP]] when it was re-released by [[Elektra Records]].\n\n\"Helpless\" would be released with ''[[The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited|The $5.98 EP: Garage Days Re-Revisited]]'' in 1987 and \"The Prince\" was included as a B-side to the \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" single.\n\nDuring the [[Wherever We May Roam Tour]] Metallica played \"Am I Evil?\" and \"Helpless\" with the original band members on 5 November 1992 at [[NEC Arena]] in [[Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M8F0LBweQY |title=Metallica \u2013 Am I Evil / Helpless with Diamond Head \u2013 Birmingham 1992 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official recordings of \"Am I Evil?\", \"Helpless\" and \"The Prince\" would also be featured on [[Metallica]]'s 2-CD ''[[Garage Inc.]]'' compilation, a collection of numerous cover songs that the band had played over the years. The first CD in the set was newly recorded covers, one of which was Diamond Head's \"It's Electric\".\n\nMetallica performed \"Am I Evil?\" along with the other bands in the Big 4 ([[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Slayer]]) at the 2011 Sonisphere festival, and with Diamond Head themselves at the Sonisphere festival in Knebworth on 8 July 2011. Lars Ulrich said that there was \"a pretty good chance that none of us would be here\" without Brian Tatler before playing the song. The following day Brian performed \"Helpless\" with Metallica and Anthrax at the Sonisphere festival in ''[[Amn\u00e9ville, France]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diamond-head.net/DHnews129.htm |title=Diamond Head Homepage |publisher=Diamond-head.net |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 December 2011 Brian Tatler and Sean Harris joined Metallica onstage at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco to celebrate Metallica's 30th Anniversary. Together they played \"The Prince\", \"It's Electric\", \"Helpless\" and \"Am I Evil?\". Tatler and Harris also took part in a group encore of \"Seek and Destroy\". Metallica have performed \"Am I Evil?\" onstage over 750 times.\n\n==Band members==\n;Current members\n*[[Brian Tatler]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals <small>(1976\u20131985, 1991\u20131994, 2000\u2013present)</small>\n*Karl Wilcox \u2013 drums <small>(1991\u20131994, 2002\u2013present)</small>\n*Andy \"Abbz\" Abberley \u2013 rhythm guitar <small>(2006\u2013present)</small>\n*Rasmus Bom Andersen \u2013 lead vocals <small>(2014\u2013present)</small>\n*Dean Ashton \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2016\u2013present)</small>\n\n;Former members\n*Sean Harris \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar <small>(1976\u20131985, 1990\u20131994, 2000\u20132004)</small>\n*Colin Kimberley \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(1976\u20131983)</small>\n*Duncan Scott \u2013 drums <small>(1976\u20131983)</small>\n*[[Robbie France]] \u2013 drums <small>(1983\u20131985;
