Male peafowl are referred to as '''peacocks''', and female peafowl as '''peahens''', though peafowl of either sex are often referred to [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as \"peacocks.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058859/peacock |title=Peacock (bird) |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}</ref> The two Asiatic species are the blue or [[Indian peafowl]] originally of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[green peafowl]] of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the [[Congo peafowl]], native only to the [[Congo Basin]]. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted \"tail\" or \"train\" of [[covert feathers]], which they display as part of a [[courtship]] ritual.\n\nThe functions of the elaborate [[iridescent]] [[animal coloration|colouration]] and large \"train\" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. [[Charles Darwin]] suggested they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by [[sexual selection]]. More recently, [[Amotz Zahavi]] proposed in his [[handicap theory]] that these features [[signalling theory|acted as honest signals]] of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.\n\n==Plumage==\n[[File:Eggs of Peafowl at Aravath Kasaragod.jpg|thumb|Peafowl eggs]] \n[[File:Baby Peacock (18131813108).jpg|thumb|Peafowl peachick]]\n[[File:Peacock-JS.jpg|thumb|Head of adult male peafowl]]\n[[File:Paon blanc Mad\u00e8re 2008.jpg|thumb|A [[leucistic]] Indian peacock]]\n[[File:Biomechanics-of-the-Peacocks-Display-How-Feather-Structure-and-Resonance-Influence-Multimodal-pone.0152759.s002.ogv|thumb|Video analysis of the mechanisms behind the display]]\n[[File:Peacock by Nihal jabin.jpg|thumb|Peacock from behind]]\nThe Indian peacock has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metallic blue and green, but the green peacock has green and bronze body feathers. In both species, females are as big as males, but lack the train and the head ornament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/peacock|title=Peacock \u2013 Facts and Habitat|encyclopedia=britannica.com}}</ref> The peacock \"tail\", known as a \"train\", consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. Both sexes of all species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.\n\n[[Green peafowl]] differ from Indian peafowl in that the male has green and gold plumage and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, only having shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence.\n\nThe Congo peacock male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.\n\nChicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and \"dirty white\" ivory.\n\n===Colour and pattern variations===\n\nHybrids between Indian and Green peafowl are called Spaldings, after the first person to successfully hybridise them, Mrs. Keith Spalding. Unlike many hybrids, spaldings are fertile and generally benefit from hybrid vigor; spaldings with a high-green phenotype do much better in cold temperatures than the cold-intolerant green peafowl while still looking like their green parents. Plumage varies between individual spaldings, with some looking far more like green peafowl and some looking far more like blue peafowl, though most visually carry traits of both.\n\nIn addition to the wild-type \"blue\" colouration, several hundred variations in colour and pattern are recognised as separate morphs of the Indian Blue among peafowl breeders. Pattern variations include solid-wing/black shoulder (the black and brown stripes on the wing are instead one solid colour), pied, white-eye (the ocelli in a male's eye feathers have white spots instead of black), and silver pied (a mostly white bird with small patches of colour). colour variations include white, purple, Buford bronze, opal, midnight, charcoal, jade, and taupe, as well as the sex-linked colours purple, cameo, peach, and Sonja's Violeta. Additional colour and pattern variations are first approved by the United Peafowl Association to become officially recognised as a morph among breeders. Alternately-coloured peafowl are born differently coloured than wild-type peafowl, and though each colour is recognisable at hatch, their peachick plumage does not necessarily match their adult plumage.\n\nOccasionally, peafowl appear with white plumage. Although [[albinism|albino]] peafowl do exist,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} this is quite rare, and almost all white peafowl are not albinos; they have a genetic condition called [[leucism]], which causes pigment cells to fail to migrate from the neural crest during development. Leucistic peafowl can produce pigment but not deposit the pigment to their feathers. This results in the complete lack of colouration in their plumage and blue-grey eye colour.  Pied peafowl are affected by partial leucism, where only some pigment cells fail to migrate, resulting in birds that have colour but also have patches absent of all colour; they, too, have blue-grey eyes. By contrast, true albino peafowl would have a complete lack of [[melanin]], resulting in irises that look red or pink. Leucistic peachicks are born yellow and become fully white as they mature.\n\n===Iridescence===\n{{further|Iridescence|Structural colouration}}\n\nAs with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily [[pigment]]s, but [[structural coloration|structural colouration]]. Optical [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] [[Bragg reflections]], based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the [[barbule]]s (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the peacock's colours. Slight changes to the spacing of these barbules result in different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer|Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interference]] peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Such structural colouration causes the iridescence of the peacock's hues. Interference effects depend on light angle rather than actual pigments.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Blau | first=S.

He expanded upon this in his second book, ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''.\n\n{{quote|The sexual struggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between individuals of the same sex, generally the males, in order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the struggle is likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite or charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no longer remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners.<ref>Darwin, Charles. (1871), ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' John Murray, London.</ref>}}\n\nSexual selection is the ability of male and female organisms to exert selective forces on each other with regard to mating activity.<ref>Jacobs, M. March 10, 1999. A New Look at Darwinian Sexual Selection. Natural Science. [9/14/2014]; http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-11/ns_mej.html</ref> The strongest driver of sexual selection is gamete size. In general, eggs are bigger than sperm, and females produce fewer gametes than males. This leads to eggs being a bigger investment, so to females being choosy about the traits that will be passed on to her offspring by males. The peahen's reproductive success and the likelihood of survival of her chicks is partly dependent on the genotype of the mate.<ref>Manning, JT. December 19, 2002.

Some of these suggest direct benefits to females, such as protection, shelter, or nuptial gifts that sway the female's choice of mate. Another hypothesis is that females choose mates with good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger, brighter peacock trains, tend to have better genes in the peahen's eyes.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Manning, J. T. | title=Age-advertisement and the evolution of the peacock's train | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=379\u2013384 | doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1989.2050379.x| year=1989 }}</ref> These better genes directly benefit her offspring, as well as her fitness and reproductive success. Runaway selection also seeks to clarify the evolution of the peacock's train. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in males and females code for sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females.<ref>Caldwell, Roy, and Jennifer Collins. \"[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIE3aRunawayselec.shtml When Sexual Selection Runs Away] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129135558/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIE3aRunawayselec.shtml |date=29 November 2014 }}.\" Evolution 101: Runaway Selection. N.p., n.d. 24 November 2014.</ref> The close spatial association of [[alleles]] for [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] involved in the train in males, and for preference for more exuberant trains in females, on the chromosome ([[linkage disequilibrium]]) causes a [[positive feedback]] loop that exaggerates both the male traits and the female preferences. Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a nonmating context that becomes transferred to mating. Multiple causality for the evolution of female choice is also possible.\n\nWork concerning female behaviour in many species of animals has sought to confirm Darwin's basic idea of female preference for males with certain characteristics as a major force in the evolution of species.<ref name=\"Zuk\">Zuk, Marlene. (2002). ''Sexual Selections: What we can and can't learn about sex from animals''.

''An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology'', 4th ed., Wiley-Blackwell; Oxford.</ref> In some cases, those males have been shown to be more healthy and vigorous, suggesting that the ornaments serve as markers indicating the males' abilities to survive, and thus their genetic qualities.\n\nThe peacock's train and iridescent plumage are perhaps the best-known example of traits believed to have arisen through sexual selection, though with some controversy.<ref>[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/male-peacocks-feathers-fail-to-impress-females-study_10031697.html Male Peacock's Feather Fails to Impress Females: Study]. The Indian News. 27 March 2008.</ref> Male peafowl erect their trains to form a shimmering fan in their display to females. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signalled a male's genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in [[Whipsnade Wildlife Park]] in southern England. The number of [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s in the train predicted a male's mating success. She was able to manipulate this success by cutting the eyespots off some of the males' tails:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Petrie |first=Marion |last2=Halliday |first2=T. |last3=Sanders |first3=C. |year=1991 |title=Peahens prefer peacocks with elaborate trains |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=41 |pages=323\u2013331 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80484-1 |issue=2}}</ref> females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones.

Chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed more than those fathered by less ornamented males, an attribute generally associated with better survival rate in birds. These chicks were released into the park and recaptured one year later. Those with heavily ornamented feathers were better able to avoid predators and survive in natural conditions.<ref name=\"Zuk\" /> Thus, Petrie's work has shown correlations between tail ornamentation, mating success, and increased survival ability in both the ornamented males and their offspring.\n\n[[File:Peacock Flying.jpg|thumb|A peacock in flight: Zahavi argued that the long train would be a handicap.]]\n\nFurthermore, peafowl and their sexual characteristics have been used in the discussion of the causes for sexual traits. Amotz Zahavi used the excessive tail plumes of male peafowls as evidence for his \"[[handicap principle]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|title=Mate selection\u2014A selection for a handicap|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=53|issue=1|year=1975|pages=205\u2013214|pmid=1195756|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3|url=http://ckwri.tamuk.edu/fileadmin/tpl/misc/Selection_for_a_handicap_Zahavi_1975.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.3819|access-date=28 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126204931/http://ckwri.tamuk.edu/fileadmin/tpl/misc/Selection_for_a_handicap_Zahavi_1975.pdf|archive-date=26 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since these trains are likely to be deleterious to an individual's survival (as their brilliance makes them more visible to [[predator]]s and their length hinders escape from danger), Zahavi argued that only the fittest males could survive the handicap of a large train. Thus, a brilliant train serves as an [[signalling theory|honest indicator]] for females that these highly ornamented males are good at surviving for other reasons, so are  preferable mates.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Loyau | first=A. |author2=Saint Jalme, M. |author3=Cagniant, C. | title=Multiple sexual advertisements honestly reflect health status in peacocks (''Pavo cristatus'') | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 58 | issue = 6 | pages=552\u2013557 | date=3 May 2005 | doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0958-y }}</ref> This theory may be contrasted with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s theory (and Darwin's hypothesis) that male sexual traits are the result of initially arbitrary [[aesthetic]] selection by females.\n\nIn contrast to Petrie's findings, a seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl concluded that female peafowl do not select mates solely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens preferred peacocks with more elaborate trains (such as with more eyespots), a more symmetrical arrangement, or a greater length.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Takahashi|first1=Mariko|last2=Arita|first2=Hiroyuki|last3=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|first3=Mariko|last4=Hasegawa|first4=Toshikazu|title=Peahens do not prefer peacocks with more elaborate trains|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=75|issue=4|year=2008|pages=1209\u20131219|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.10.004|url=http://id.nii.ac.jp/1013/00003652/}}</ref> Takahashi determined that the peacock's train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and did not correlate with male physiological condition.

Natural Science.</ref>\n\n====Natural selection====\nIt has been suggested<!--by a serious scientist?--> that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless behaviour have been formed by natural selection (not sexual selection), and served as an [[aposematic]] display to intimidate predators and rivals.<ref>[[Joseph Jordania|Jordania, Joseph]] (2011) \"Peacock's Tail: Tale of Beauty and Intimidation\". pp. 192\u2013196 in ''[[Why do People Sing?

The angle at which the ocelli are displayed during courtship is more important in a peahen's choice of males than train size or number of ocelli.<ref name=Dakin>{{cite journal |last=Dakin |first=Roslyn |author2=Robert Montgomerie |title=Eye for an Eyespot: How Iridescent Plumage Ocelli Influence Peacock Mating Success |journal=Ebscohost. The Original Journal of the ISBE |date=2013 }}</ref> Peahens pay careful attention to the different parts of a peacock's train during his display. The lower train is usually evaluated during close-up courtship, while the upper train is more of a long-distance attraction signal. Actions such as train rattling and wing shaking also kept the peahens' attention.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yorzinski |first=Jessica L. |author2=Patricell, Gail L.  |author3=Babcock, Jason S.  |author4=Pearson, John M.  |author5=Platt, Michael L.  |title=Through Their Eyes: Selective Attention in Peahens During Courtship |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=216 |issue=22 |pages=4310 |date=2 April 2013 |pmc=4232502 |doi=10.1242/jeb.098392 }}</ref>\n\n====Redundant signal hypothesis====\nAlthough an intricate display catches a peahen's attention, the redundant signal hypothesis also plays a crucial role in keeping this attention on the peacock's display. The redundant signal hypothesis explains that whilst each signal that a male projects is about the same quality, the addition of multiple signals enhances the reliability of that mate. This idea also suggests that the success of multiple signalling is not only due to the repetitiveness of the signal, but also of multiple receivers of the signal. In the peacock species, males congregate a communal display during breeding season and the peahens observe. Peacocks first defend their territory through intra-sexual behaviour, defending their areas from intruders. They fight for areas within the congregation to display a strong front for the peahens. Central positions are usually taken by older, dominant males, which influences mating success. Certain morphological and behavioural traits come in to play during inter and intra-sexual selection, which include train length for territory acquisition and visual and vocal displays involved in mate choice by peahens.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Loyau |first=Adeline |author2=Michel S.

Some studies suggest that the intricacy of the \"song\" produced by displaying peacocks proved to be impressive to peafowl. Singing in peacocks usually occurs just before, just after, or sometimes during copulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yorzinski |first=Jessica L. |author2=K. R.

They are terrestrial feeders. All species of peafowl are believed to be [[Polygamy|polygamous]].  In common with other members of the [[Galliformes]], the males possess metatarsal spurs or \"thorns\" on their legs used during [[Intraspecific antagonism|intraspecific]] territorial fights with other members of their kind.\n\n==Diet==\nPeafowl are [[omnivore]]s and eat mostly plant parts, flower petals, seed heads, insects and other [[arthropod]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[amphibian]]s. Wild peafowl look for their food scratching around in leaf litter either early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat to the shade and security of the woods for the hottest portion of the day. These birds are not picky and will eat almost anything they can fit in their beak and digest. They actively hunt insects like ants, crickets and termites; millipedes; and other [[arthropod]]s and small mammals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peacock |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/peacock/ |website=National Geographic |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302193601/http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/peacock/ |archivedate=2010-03-02}}</ref> Indian peafowl also eat small snakes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Johnsingh, AJT |year=1976| title=Peacocks and cobra| journal= J.

Nonetheless, using the peacock as the symbol of royalty has an old and distinguished pedigree in India too.\n\n[[File:Caucasian albanian stone azerbaijan mingechaur2.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Stone from [[Mingachevir Church Complex]]]]\n\n[[Melek Taus]] ({{lang-ar|\u0637\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633 \u0645\u0644\u0643}}; {{lang-fa|\u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u0637\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633}}; {{lang-ku|Taw\u00fbs\u00ea Melek}}), the \"Peacock Angel\", is the [[Yazidi]] name for the central figure of their faith.

In Hellenistic imagery, the Greek goddess [[Hera]]'s chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. Alexander's tutor, [[Aristotle]], refers to it as \"the Persian bird\". Alexander was so amazed of their beauty, when he saw the birds in India, that he threatened the severest penalties for any man who slew one.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.21 Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, \u00a7 5.21]</ref> [[Claudius Aelianus]] writes that there were Peacocks in India, larger than anywhere else<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg001.perseus-grc1:16.2 Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, \u00a7 16.2]</ref>\n\nOne myth states that Hera's servant, the hundred-eyed [[Argus Panoptes]], was instructed to guard the woman-turned-cow, [[Io (mythology)|Io]]. Hera had transformed Io into a cow after learning of [[Zeus]]'s interest in her. Zeus had the messenger of the gods, [[Hermes]], kill Argus through eternal sleep and free Io. According to [[Ovid]], to commemorate her faithful watchman, Hera had the hundred eyes of Argus preserved forever, in the peacock's tail.<ref>[[Ovid]] I, 625. The peacock is an Eastern bird, unknown to Greeks before the time of Alexander.</ref>\n \nThe symbolism was adopted by early Christianity, thus many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season, especially in the east.<ref>\"Birds, symbolic\". Peter and Linda Murray, ''Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art'' (2004).</ref> The 'eyes' in the peacock's tail feathers symbolise the all-seeing Christian God and \u2013 in some interpretations \u2013 the Church. A peacock drinking from a vase is used as a symbol of a Christian believer drinking from the waters of eternal life. The peacock can also symbolise the cosmos if one interprets its tail with its many 'eyes' as the vault of heaven dotted by the sun, moon, and stars. By Christian adoption of old Persian and Babylonian symbolism, in which the peacock was associated with Paradise and the Tree of Life, the bird is again associated with immortality. In Christian iconography, the peacock is often depicted next to the Tree of Life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singhaniauniversity.co.in |title=Singhania University|publisher=Jewish Folk Songs |language=en |accessdate=2017-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAmong [[Ashkenazi Jews]], the golden peacock is a symbol for joy and creativity, with quills from the bird's feathers being a metaphor for a writer's inspiration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfolksongs.com/en/golden-peacock |title=The Golden Peacock |publisher=Jewish Folk Songs |language=en |accessdate=2017-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe peacock motif was revived in the [[Renaissance]] iconography that unified Hera and Juno, and on which European painters focused.<ref>Seznec, Jean (1953) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods: Mythological Tradition in Renaissance Humanism and Art''</ref>\n\nIn 1956, John J.

Stuff it with what you like, as truffles, mushrooms, livers of fowls, bacon, salt, spice, thyme, crumbs of bread, and a bay-leaf. Wrap the claws and head in several folds of cloth, and envelope the body in buttered paper. The head and claws, which project at the two ends, must be basted with water during the cooking, to preserve them, and especially the tuft. Before taking it off the spit, brown the bird by removing the paper. Garnish with lemon and flowers. If to come on the table cold, place the bird in a wooden trencher, in the middle of which is fixed a wooden skewer, which should penetrate the body of the bird, to keep it upright. Arrange the claws and feathers in a natural manner, and the tail like a fan, supported with wire. No ordinary cook can place a peacock on the table properly. This ceremony was reserved, in the times of chivalry, for the lady most distinguished for her beauty. She carried it, amidst inspiring music, and placed it, at the commencement of the banquet, before the master of the house. At a nuptial feast, the peacock was served by the maid of honour, and placed before the bride for her to consume.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Edward |title=The English and Australian Cookery Book |url=https://archive.org/details/b21505524 |date=1864}}</ref></blockquote>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Commons and category-inline|Pavo cristatus|Pavo cristatus}}\n* {{wikispecies-inline|Pavo}}\n\n{{Phasianidae}}\n{{Birds in culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Birds of Asia|\u00a0]]\n[[Category:Peafowl| ]]\n[[Category:National symbols of India]]\n[[Category:Bird common names]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Type of bird}}\n{{redirect|Peacock|other uses|Peacock (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{Taxobox\n| name = Peafowl\n| fossil_range = {{Fossil range|3|0}}<small>Late [[Pliocene]] \u2013 recent</small>\n| image = Peacock Plumage.jpg\n| image_upright = 1.2\n| image_caption = [[Indian peafowl|Indian peacock]] displaying its train\n| regnum = [[Animalia]]\n| phylum = [[Chordata]]\n| classis = [[Aves]]\n| ordo = [[Galliformes]]\n| familia = [[Phasianidae]]\n| subfamilia = [[Phasianinae]]\n| subdivision_ranks = Species\n| subdivision = ''[[Pavo cristatus]]''<br />''[[Pavo muticus]]''<br>''[[Congo peafowl|Afropavo congensis]]''\n}}\n\n'''Peafowl''' is a common name for three species of birds in the [[genera]] ''[[Pavo (genus)|Pavo]]'' and ''[[Afropavo]]'' of the [[Phasianidae]] family, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as '''peacocks''', and female peafowl as '''peahens''', though peafowl of either sex are often referred to [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as \"peacocks.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058859/peacock |title=Peacock (bird) |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}</ref> The two Asiatic species are the blue or [[Indian peafowl]] originally of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[green peafowl]] of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the [[Congo peafowl]], native only to the [[Congo Basin]]. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted \"tail\" or \"train\" of [[covert feathers]], which they display as part of a [[courtship]] ritual.\n\nThe functions of the elaborate [[iridescent]] [[animal coloration|colouration]] and large \"train\" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. [[Charles Darwin]] suggested they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by [[sexual selection]]. More recently, [[Amotz Zahavi]] proposed in his [[handicap theory]] that these features [[signalling theory|acted as honest signals]] of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.\n\n==Plumage==\n[[File:Eggs of Peafowl at Aravath Kasaragod.jpg|thumb|Peafowl eggs]] \n[[File:Baby Peacock (18131813108).jpg|thumb|Peafowl peachick]]\n[[File:Peacock-JS.jpg|thumb|Head of adult male peafowl]]\n[[File:Paon blanc Mad\u00e8re 2008.jpg|thumb|A [[leucistic]] Indian peacock]]\n[[File:Biomechanics-of-the-Peacocks-Display-How-Feather-Structure-and-Resonance-Influence-Multimodal-pone.0152759.s002.ogv|thumb|Video analysis of the mechanisms behind the display]]\n[[File:Peacock by Nihal jabin.jpg|thumb|Peacock from behind]]\nThe Indian peacock has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metallic blue and green, but the green peacock has green and bronze body feathers. In both species, females are as big as males, but lack the train and the head ornament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/peacock|title=Peacock \u2013 Facts and Habitat|encyclopedia=britannica.com}}</ref> The peacock \"tail\", known as a \"train\", consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. Both sexes of all species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.\n\n[[Green peafowl]] differ from Indian peafowl in that the male has green and gold plumage and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, only having shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence.\n\nThe Congo peacock male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.\n\nChicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and \"dirty white\" ivory.\n\n===Colour and pattern variations===\n\nHybrids between Indian and Green peafowl are called Spaldings, after the first person to successfully hybridise them, Mrs. Keith Spalding. Unlike many hybrids, spaldings are fertile and generally benefit from hybrid vigor; spaldings with a high-green phenotype do much better in cold temperatures than the cold-intolerant green peafowl while still looking like their green parents. Plumage varies between individual spaldings, with some looking far more like green peafowl and some looking far more like blue peafowl, though most visually carry traits of both.\n\nIn addition to the wild-type \"blue\" colouration, several hundred variations in colour and pattern are recognised as separate morphs of the Indian Blue among peafowl breeders. Pattern variations include solid-wing/black shoulder (the black and brown stripes on the wing are instead one solid colour), pied, white-eye (the ocelli in a male's eye feathers have white spots instead of black), and silver pied (a mostly white bird with small patches of colour). colour variations include white, purple, Buford bronze, opal, midnight, charcoal, jade, and taupe, as well as the sex-linked colours purple, cameo, peach, and Sonja's Violeta. Additional colour and pattern variations are first approved by the United Peafowl Association to become officially recognised as a morph among breeders. Alternately-coloured peafowl are born differently coloured than wild-type peafowl, and though each colour is recognisable at hatch, their peachick plumage does not necessarily match their adult plumage.\n\nOccasionally, peafowl appear with white plumage. Although [[albinism|albino]] peafowl do exist,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} this is quite rare, and almost all white peafowl are not albinos; they have a genetic condition called [[leucism]], which causes pigment cells to fail to migrate from the neural crest during development. Leucistic peafowl can produce pigment but not deposit the pigment to their feathers. This results in the complete lack of colouration in their plumage and blue-grey eye colour.  Pied peafowl are affected by partial leucism, where only some pigment cells fail to migrate, resulting in birds that have colour but also have patches absent of all colour; they, too, have blue-grey eyes. By contrast, true albino peafowl would have a complete lack of [[melanin]], resulting in irises that look red or pink. Leucistic peachicks are born yellow and become fully white as they mature.\n\n===Iridescence===\n{{further|Iridescence|Structural colouration}}\n\nAs with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily [[pigment]]s, but [[structural coloration|structural colouration]]. Optical [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] [[Bragg reflections]], based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the [[barbule]]s (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the peacock's colours. Slight changes to the spacing of these barbules result in different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer|Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interference]] peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Such structural colouration causes the iridescence of the peacock's hues. Interference effects depend on light angle rather than actual pigments.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Blau | first=S.

He expanded upon this in his second book, ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''.\n\n{{quote|The sexual struggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between individuals of the same sex, generally the males, in order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the struggle is likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite or charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no longer remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners.<ref>Darwin, Charles. (1871), ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' John Murray, London.</ref>}}\n\nSexual selection is the ability of male and female organisms to exert selective forces on each other with regard to mating activity.<ref>Jacobs, M.

[9/14/2014]; http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-11/ns_mej.html</ref> The strongest driver of sexual selection is gamete size. In general, eggs are bigger than sperm, and females produce fewer gametes than males. This leads to eggs being a bigger investment, so to females being choosy about the traits that will be passed on to her offspring by males. The peahen's reproductive success and the likelihood of survival of her chicks is partly dependent on the genotype of the mate.<ref>Manning, JT. December 19, 2002.

Some of these suggest direct benefits to females, such as protection, shelter, or nuptial gifts that sway the female's choice of mate. Another hypothesis is that females choose mates with good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger, brighter peacock trains, tend to have better genes in the peahen's eyes.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Manning, J. T. | title=Age-advertisement and the evolution of the peacock's train | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=379\u2013384 | doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1989.2050379.x| year=1989 }}</ref> These better genes directly benefit her offspring, as well as her fitness and reproductive success. Runaway selection also seeks to clarify the evolution of the peacock's train.

Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a nonmating context that becomes transferred to mating. Multiple causality for the evolution of female choice is also possible.\n\nWork concerning female behaviour in many species of animals has sought to confirm Darwin's basic idea of female preference for males with certain characteristics as a major force in the evolution of species.<ref name=\"Zuk\">Zuk, Marlene.

Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signalled a male's genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in [[Whipsnade Wildlife Park]] in southern England.

Chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed more than those fathered by less ornamented males, an attribute generally associated with better survival rate in birds. These chicks were released into the park and recaptured one year later. Those with heavily ornamented feathers were better able to avoid predators and survive in natural conditions.<ref name=\"Zuk\" /> Thus, Petrie's work has shown correlations between tail ornamentation, mating success, and increased survival ability in both the ornamented males and their offspring.\n\n[[File:Peacock Flying.jpg|thumb|A peacock in flight: Zahavi argued that the long train would be a handicap.]]\n\nFurthermore, peafowl and their sexual characteristics have been used in the discussion of the causes for sexual traits.

(10 March 1999). [http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-11/ns_mej.html A New Look at Darwinian Sexual Selection]. Natural Science.</ref>\n\n====Natural selection====\nIt has been suggested<!--by a serious scientist?--> that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless behaviour have been formed by natural selection (not sexual selection), and served as an [[aposematic]] display to intimidate predators and rivals.<ref>[[Joseph Jordania|Jordania, Joseph]] (2011) \"Peacock's Tail: Tale of Beauty and Intimidation\". pp. 192\u2013196 in ''[[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]'' Logos.</ref>\n\n====Plumage colours as attractants====\n[[File:Peacock Feather Close Up.JPG|thumb|upright|Eyespot on a peacock's train feather]]\n\nA peacock's copulation success rate depends on the colours of his [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots (ocelli)]] and the angle at which they are displayed. The angle at which the ocelli are displayed during courtship is more important in a peahen's choice of males than train size or number of ocelli.<ref name=Dakin>{{cite journal |last=Dakin |first=Roslyn |author2=Robert Montgomerie |title=Eye for an Eyespot: How Iridescent Plumage Ocelli Influence Peacock Mating Success |journal=Ebscohost. The Original Journal of the ISBE |date=2013 }}</ref> Peahens pay careful attention to the different parts of a peacock's train during his display. The lower train is usually evaluated during close-up courtship, while the upper train is more of a long-distance attraction signal. Actions such as train rattling and wing shaking also kept the peahens' attention.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yorzinski |first=Jessica L. |author2=Patricell, Gail L.  |author3=Babcock, Jason S.  |author4=Pearson, John M.  |author5=Platt, Michael L.  |title=Through Their Eyes: Selective Attention in Peahens During Courtship |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=216 |issue=22 |pages=4310 |date=2 April 2013 |pmc=4232502 |doi=10.1242/jeb.098392 }}</ref>\n\n====Redundant signal hypothesis====\nAlthough an intricate display catches a peahen's attention, the redundant signal hypothesis also plays a crucial role in keeping this attention on the peacock's display. The redundant signal hypothesis explains that whilst each signal that a male projects is about the same quality, the addition of multiple signals enhances the reliability of that mate. This idea also suggests that the success of multiple signalling is not only due to the repetitiveness of the signal, but also of multiple receivers of the signal. In the peacock species, males congregate a communal display during breeding season and the peahens observe. Peacocks first defend their territory through intra-sexual behaviour, defending their areas from intruders. They fight for areas within the congregation to display a strong front for the peahens. Central positions are usually taken by older, dominant males, which influences mating success. Certain morphological and behavioural traits come in to play during inter and intra-sexual selection, which include train length for territory acquisition and visual and vocal displays involved in mate choice by peahens.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Loyau |first=Adeline |author2=Michel S.

Some studies suggest that the intricacy of the \"song\" produced by displaying peacocks proved to be impressive to peafowl. Singing in peacocks usually occurs just before, just after, or sometimes during copulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yorzinski |first=Jessica L. |author2=K. R.

They are terrestrial feeders. All species of peafowl are believed to be [[Polygamy|polygamous]].  In common with other members of the [[Galliformes]], the males possess metatarsal spurs or \"thorns\" on their legs used during [[Intraspecific antagonism|intraspecific]] territorial fights with other members of their kind.\n\n==Diet==\nPeafowl are [[omnivore]]s and eat mostly plant parts, flower petals, seed heads, insects and other [[arthropod]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[amphibian]]s. Wild peafowl look for their food scratching around in leaf litter either early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat to the shade and security of the woods for the hottest portion of the day. These birds are not picky and will eat almost anything they can fit in their beak and digest. They actively hunt insects like ants, crickets and termites; millipedes; and other [[arthropod]]s and small mammals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peacock |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/peacock/ |website=National Geographic |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302193601/http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/peacock/ |archivedate=2010-03-02}}</ref> Indian peafowl also eat small snakes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Johnsingh, AJT |year=1976| title=Peacocks and cobra| journal= J.

Out of respect for his adversary's prowess in battle, the God converted the two halves as an integral part of himself.

When establishing his empire with the aid of [[Chanakya]], Chandragupta ascribed its name as Maurya (\u092e\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092f), translating to \"peacock- ness\". After conquering the [[Nanda Empire]] and defeating the [[Seleucid Empire]], Chandragupta established the uncontested power of its time. Its royal emblem remained the peacock until Emperor Ashoka changed it to [[Lions]], as seen in the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]], as well in his [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]]. The peacocks significance of elegance and royalty pertained in India during medieval times, as it was the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] seat of power called the [[Peacock Throne]].\n\nThe peacock is represented in both the [[Burmese zodiac#Weekdays|Burmese]] and [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] [[zodiacs]]. To the [[Sinhalese people]], the peacock is the third animal of the zodiac of [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoJEAAAAcAAJ|title=The history and doctrine of Budhism, popularly illustrated|first=Edward|last=Upham|date=20 June 2018|publisher=Ackermann|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nPeacocks (often a symbol of pride and vanity) were believed to deliberately consume poisonous substances in order to become immune to them, as well as to make the colours of their resplendent plumage all the more vibrant \u2013 seeing as so many poisonous flora and fauna are so colourful due to [[aposematism]], this idea appears to have merit. The Buddhist deity [[Mahamayuri]] is depicted seated on a peacock. Peacocks are seen supporting the throne of [[Amitabha]], the ruby red sunset coloured archetypal Buddha of Infinite Light.\n\nIndia adopted the peacock as its national bird in 1963 and it is one of the [[national symbols of India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/national-symbols/national-bird.html|title=Indian Peacock: A Symbol of Grace, Joy, Beauty and Love}}</ref>\n\n===Elsewhere===\nIn [[Persia]] and [[Babylonia]], the peacock is seen as a guardian to royalty and is often engraved upon royal thrones. Nonetheless, using the peacock as the symbol of royalty has an old and distinguished pedigree in India too.\n\n[[File:Caucasian albanian stone azerbaijan mingechaur2.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Stone from [[Mingachevir Church Complex]]]]\n\n[[Melek Taus]] ({{lang-ar|\u0637\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633 \u0645\u0644\u0643}}; {{lang-fa|\u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u0637\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633}}; {{lang-ku|Taw\u00fbs\u00ea Melek}}), the \"Peacock Angel\", is the [[Yazidi]] name for the central figure of their faith.

In Hellenistic imagery, the Greek goddess [[Hera]]'s chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. Alexander's tutor, [[Aristotle]], refers to it as \"the Persian bird\". Alexander was so amazed of their beauty, when he saw the birds in India, that he threatened the severest penalties for any man who slew one.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.21 Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, \u00a7 5.21]</ref> [[Claudius Aelianus]] writes that there were Peacocks in India, larger than anywhere else<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg001.perseus-grc1:16.2 Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, \u00a7 16.2]</ref>\n\nOne myth states that Hera's servant, the hundred-eyed [[Argus Panoptes]], was instructed to guard the woman-turned-cow, [[Io (mythology)|Io]]. Hera had transformed Io into a cow after learning of [[Zeus]]'s interest in her. Zeus had the messenger of the gods, [[Hermes]], kill Argus through eternal sleep and free Io. According to [[Ovid]], to commemorate her faithful watchman, Hera had the hundred eyes of Argus preserved forever, in the peacock's tail.<ref>[[Ovid]] I, 625. The peacock is an Eastern bird, unknown to Greeks before the time of Alexander.</ref>\n \nThe symbolism was adopted by early Christianity, thus many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season, especially in the east.<ref>\"Birds, symbolic\". Peter and Linda Murray, ''Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art'' (2004).</ref> The 'eyes' in the peacock's tail feathers symbolise the all-seeing Christian God and \u2013 in some interpretations \u2013 the Church. A peacock drinking from a vase is used as a symbol of a Christian believer drinking from the waters of eternal life. The peacock can also symbolise the cosmos if one interprets its tail with its many 'eyes' as the vault of heaven dotted by the sun, moon, and stars. By Christian adoption of old Persian and Babylonian symbolism, in which the peacock was associated with Paradise and the Tree of Life, the bird is again associated with immortality. In Christian iconography, the peacock is often depicted next to the Tree of Life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singhaniauniversity.co.in |title=Singhania University|publisher=Jewish Folk Songs |language=en |accessdate=2017-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAmong [[Ashkenazi Jews]], the golden peacock is a symbol for joy and creativity, with quills from the bird's feathers being a metaphor for a writer's inspiration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfolksongs.com/en/golden-peacock |title=The Golden Peacock |publisher=Jewish Folk Songs |language=en |accessdate=2017-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe peacock motif was revived in the [[Renaissance]] iconography that unified Hera and Juno, and on which European painters focused.<ref>Seznec, Jean (1953) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods: Mythological Tradition in Renaissance Humanism and Art''</ref>\n\nIn 1956, John J. Graham created an abstraction of an 11-feathered [[peacock logo]] for American broadcaster [[NBC]]. This brightly hued peacock was adopted due to the increase in colour programming.

Stuff it with what you like, as truffles, mushrooms, livers of fowls, bacon, salt, spice, thyme, crumbs of bread, and a bay-leaf. Wrap the claws and head in several folds of cloth, and envelope the body in buttered paper. The head and claws, which project at the two ends, must be basted with water during the cooking, to preserve them, and especially the tuft. Before taking it off the spit, brown the bird by removing the paper. Garnish with lemon and flowers. If to come on the table cold, place the bird in a wooden trencher, in the middle of which is fixed a wooden skewer, which should penetrate the body of the bird, to keep it upright. Arrange the claws and feathers in a natural manner, and the tail like a fan, supported with wire. No ordinary cook can place a peacock on the table properly. This ceremony was reserved, in the times of chivalry, for the lady most distinguished for her beauty. She carried it, amidst inspiring music, and placed it, at the commencement of the banquet, before the master of the house. At a nuptial feast, the peacock was served by the maid of honour, and placed before the bride for her to consume.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Edward |title=The English and Australian Cookery Book |url=https://archive.org/details/b21505524 |date=1864}}</ref></blockquote>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Commons and category-inline|Pavo cristatus|Pavo cristatus}}\n* {{wikispecies-inline|Pavo}}\n\n{{Phasianidae}}\n{{Birds in culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Birds of Asia|\u00a0]]\n[[Category:Peafowl| ]]\n[[Category:National symbols of India]]\n[[Category:Bird common names]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "2601:681:4202:9830:d8bf:41ca:b3ee:e460", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl"}
