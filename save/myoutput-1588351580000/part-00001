In other words, clathrate hydrates are [[clathrate compound]]s in which the host molecule is [[water]] and the guest molecule is typically a gas or liquid.  Without the support of the trapped molecules, the [[Crystal structure|lattice]] structure of hydrate clathrates would collapse into conventional ice crystal structure or liquid water. Most low molecular weight gases, including {{oxygen}}<sub>2</sub>, {{hydrogen}}<sub>2</sub>, {{nitrogen}}<sub>2</sub>, [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]], [[hydrogen sulfide|H<sub>2</sub>S]], {{argon}}, {{krypton}}, and {{xenon}}, as well as some higher [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[freon]]s, will form [[hydrate]]s at suitable temperatures and pressures. Clathrate hydrates are not officially chemical compounds, as the sequestered molecules are never bonded to the lattice. The formation and decomposition of clathrate hydrates are [[Phase transition#Classification of phase transitions|first order phase transitions]], not chemical reactions. Their detailed formation and decomposition mechanisms on a molecular level are still not well understood.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gao S |author2=House W|author3=Chapman WG | year = 2005 | title = NMR MRI Study of Gas Hydrate Mechanisms | volume = 109 | pages = 19090\u201319093 | doi = 10.1021/jp052071w | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/9701479/NMR-MRI-Study-of-Gas-Hydrate-Mechanisms | accessdate = August 3, 2009 | pmid = 16853461 | issue = 41 | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B |citeseerx=10.1.1.175.9193}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Gao S |author2=Chapman WG|author3=House W | year = 2005 | title = NMR and Viscosity Investigation of Clathrate Formation and Dissociation | journal = Ind.

The unit cell contains two small cages and six large ones. The small cage has the shape of a pentagonal [[dodecahedron]] (5<sup>12</sup>) (which is not a regular dodecahedron) and the large one that of a [[tetradecahedron]], specifically a [[hexagonal truncated trapezohedron]] (5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>2</sup>).  Together, they form a version of the [[Weaire\u2013Phelan structure]]. Typical guests forming Type I hydrates are [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] in [[carbon dioxide clathrate]] and [[methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]] in [[methane clathrate]].\n\nThe unit cell of Type II consists of 136 water molecules, again forming two types of cages \u2013 small and large. In this case there are sixteen small cages and eight large ones in the unit cell.  The small cage again has the shape of a pentagonal dodecahedron (5<sup>12</sup>), but the large one is a [[hexadecahedron]] (5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>4</sup>). Type II hydrates are formed by gases like O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe unit cell of Type H consists of 34 water molecules, forming three types of cages \u2013 two small ones of different types, and one \"huge\". In this case, the unit cell consists of three small cages of type 5<sup>12</sup>, two small ones of type 4<sup>3</sup>5<sup>6</sup>6<sup>3</sup> and one huge of type 5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>8</sup>. The formation of Type H requires the cooperation of two guest gases (large and small) to be stable. It is the large cavity that allows structure H hydrates to fit in large molecules (e.g. [[butane]], [[hydrocarbon]]s), given the presence of other smaller help gases to fill and support the remaining cavities. Structure H hydrates were suggested to exist in the Gulf of Mexico.

The results can range from flow reduction to equipment damage.\n\n====Hydrate formation, prevention and mitigation philosophy====\nHydrates have a strong tendency to [[agglomerate]] and to adhere to the pipe wall and thereby plug the pipeline. Once formed, they can be decomposed by increasing the temperature and/or decreasing the pressure. Even under these conditions, the clathrate dissociation is a slow process.\n\nTherefore, preventing hydrate formation appears to be the key to the problem. A hydrate prevention philosophy could typically be based on three levels of security, listed in order of priority:\n# Avoid operational conditions that might cause formation of hydrates by depressing the hydrate formation temperature using [[glycol dehydration]];\n# Temporarily change [[operating conditions]] in order to avoid hydrate formation;\n# Prevent formation of hydrates by addition of chemicals that (a) shift the hydrate equilibrium conditions towards lower temperatures and higher pressures or (b) increase hydrate formation time ([[Reaction inhibitor|inhibitor]]s)\n\nThe actual philosophy would depend on operational circumstances such as pressure, temperature, type of flow (gas, liquid, presences of water etc.)\n\n====Hydrate inhibitors====\nWhen operating within a set of parameters where hydrates could be formed, there are still ways to avoid their formation. Altering the gas composition by adding chemicals can lower the hydrate formation temperature and/or delay their formation. Two options generally exist:\n* Thermodynamic inhibitors\n* [[Kinetic Inhibitor|Kinetic inhibitors/anti-agglomerants]]<ref>{{Cite journal|title= Synergetic effects of polyacrylamide and nonionic surfactants on preventing gas hydrate formation|pages=343\u2013349|journal=Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering|volume=30|doi=10.1016/j.jngse.2016.02.027|date=March 2016|last1=Khodaverdiloo|first1=Khadijeh Rostami|last2=Erfani|first2=Amir|last3=Peyvandi|first3=Kiana|last4=Varaminian|first4=Farshad}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erfani|first=Amir|date=|title=Gas hydrate formation inhibition using low dosage hydrate inhibitors|url=http://www.semnan.ac.ir/uploads/nicgh1392/articles/7252.pdf|journal=2nd National Iranian Conference on Gas Hydrat|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe most common thermodynamic inhibitors are [[methanol]], [[ethylene glycol|monoethylene glycol]] (MEG), and [[diethylene glycol]] (DEG), commonly referred to as [[glycol]]. All may be recovered and recirculated, but the economics of methanol recovery is not favourable in most cases. MEG is preferred over DEG for applications where the temperature is expected to be \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C or lower due to high viscosity at low temperatures. [[Triethylene glycol]] (TEG) has too low vapour pressure to be suited as an inhibitor injected into a gas stream. More methanol is lost in the gas phase when compared to MEG or DEG.\n\nThe use of [[Kinetic Inhibitor|kinetic inhibitors]] and anti-agglomerants in actual field operations is a new and evolving technology. It requires extensive tests and optimisation to the actual system. While kinetic inhibitors work by slowing down the kinetics of the nucleation, anti-agglomerants do not stop the nucleation, but stop the agglomeration (sticking together) of gas hydrate crystals.  These two kinds of inhibitors are also known as [[LDHI|low dosage hydrate inhibitors]], because they require much smaller concentrations than the conventional thermodynamic inhibitors.  Kinetic inhibitors, which do not require water and hydrocarbon mixture to be effective, are usually polymers or copolymers and anti-agglomerants (requires water and hydrocarbon mixture) are polymers or [[zwitterion]]ic&nbsp;\u2014 usually ammonium and COOH&nbsp;\u2014 surfactants being both attracted to hydrates and hydrocarbons.\n\n== Empty clathrate hydrates ==\nEmpty clathrate hydrates<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/acsearthspacechem.9b00009 | bibcode=2019ECS.....3..789C | volume=3 | title=Low-Temperature Thermodynamic Study of the Metastable Empty Clathrate Hydrates Using Molecular Simulations | year=2019 | journal=ACS Earth and Space Chemistry | pages=789\u2013799 | last1 = Cruz | first1 = Fernando J.

The results can range from flow reduction to equipment damage.\n\n====Hydrate formation, prevention and mitigation philosophy====\nHydrates have a strong tendency to [[agglomerate]] and to adhere to the pipe wall and thereby plug the pipeline. Once formed, they can be decomposed by increasing the temperature and/or decreasing the pressure. Even under these conditions, the clathrate dissociation is a slow process.\n\nTherefore, preventing hydrate formation appears to be the key to the problem. A hydrate prevention philosophy could typically be based on three levels of security, listed in order of priority:\n# Avoid operational conditions that might cause formation of hydrates by depressing the hydrate formation temperature using [[glycol dehydration]];\n# Temporarily change [[operating conditions]] in order to avoid hydrate formation;\n# Prevent formation of hydrates by addition of chemicals that (a) shift the hydrate equilibrium conditions towards lower temperatures and higher pressures or (b) increase hydrate formation time ([[Reaction inhibitor|inhibitor]]s)\n\nThe actual philosophy would depend on operational circumstances such as pressure, temperature, type of flow (gas, liquid, presences of water etc.)\n\n====Hydrate inhibitors====\nWhen operating within a set of parameters where hydrates could be formed, there are still ways to avoid their formation. Altering the gas composition by adding chemicals can lower the hydrate formation temperature and/or delay their formation. Two options generally exist:\n* Thermodynamic inhibitors\n* [[Kinetic Inhibitor|Kinetic inhibitors/anti-agglomerants]]<ref>{{Cite journal|title= Synergetic effects of polyacrylamide and nonionic surfactants on preventing gas hydrate formation|pages=343\u2013349|journal=Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering|volume=30|doi=10.1016/j.jngse.2016.02.027|date=March 2016|last1=Khodaverdiloo|first1=Khadijeh Rostami|last2=Erfani|first2=Amir|last3=Peyvandi|first3=Kiana|last4=Varaminian|first4=Farshad}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erfani|first=Amir|date=|title=Gas hydrate formation inhibition using low dosage hydrate inhibitors|url=http://www.semnan.ac.ir/uploads/nicgh1392/articles/7252.pdf|journal=2nd National Iranian Conference on Gas Hydrat|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe most common thermodynamic inhibitors are [[methanol]], [[ethylene glycol|monoethylene glycol]] (MEG), and [[diethylene glycol]] (DEG), commonly referred to as [[glycol]]. All may be recovered and recirculated, but the economics of methanol recovery is not favourable in most cases. MEG is preferred over DEG for applications where the temperature is expected to be \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C or lower due to high viscosity at low temperatures. [[Triethylene glycol]] (TEG) has too low vapour pressure to be suited as an inhibitor injected into a gas stream. More methanol is lost in the gas phase when compared to MEG or DEG.\n\nThe use of [[Kinetic Inhibitor|kinetic inhibitors]] and anti-agglomerants in actual field operations is a new and evolving technology. It requires extensive tests and optimisation to the actual system. While kinetic inhibitors work by slowing down the kinetics of the nucleation, anti-agglomerants do not stop the nucleation, but stop the agglomeration (sticking together) of gas hydrate crystals.  These two kinds of inhibitors are also known as [[LDHI|low dosage hydrate inhibitors]], because they require much smaller concentrations than the conventional thermodynamic inhibitors.  Kinetic inhibitors, which do not require water and hydrocarbon mixture to be effective, are usually polymers or copolymers and anti-agglomerants (requires water and hydrocarbon mixture) are polymers or [[zwitterion]]ic&nbsp;\u2014 usually ammonium and COOH&nbsp;\u2014 surfactants being both attracted to hydrates and hydrocarbons.\n\n== Empty clathrate hydrates ==\nEmpty clathrate hydrates<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/acsearthspacechem.9b00009 | bibcode=2019ECS.....3..789C | volume=3 | title=Low-Temperature Thermodynamic Study of the Metastable Empty Clathrate Hydrates Using Molecular Simulations | year=2019 | journal=ACS Earth and Space Chemistry | pages=789\u2013799 | last1 = Cruz | first1 = Fernando J.
