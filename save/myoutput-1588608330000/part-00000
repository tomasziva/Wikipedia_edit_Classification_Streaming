Thailand has a comparable 30 to 40 species for example, but is much smaller than India. Other countries in tropical Asia also have numerous wild species of ''Curcuma''. Recent studies have also shown that the taxonomy of ''Curcuma longa'' is problematic, with only the specimens from South India being identifiable as ''C. longa''. The phylogeny, relationships, intraspecific and interspecific variation, and even identity of other species and cultivars in other parts of the world still need to be established and validated. Various species currently utilized and sold as \"turmeric\" in other parts of Asia have been shown to belong to several physically similar taxa, with overlapping local names.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=LEONG-\u0160KORNI\u010cKOV\u00c1 |first1=JANA |last2=\u0160\u00cdDA |first2=OTAKAR |last3=WIJESUNDARA |first3=SIRIL |last4=MARHOLD |first4=KAROL |title=On the identity of turmeric: the typification of Curcuma longa L.

The phylogeny, relationships, intraspecific and interspecific variation, and even identity of other species and cultivars in other parts of the world still need to be established and validated.
