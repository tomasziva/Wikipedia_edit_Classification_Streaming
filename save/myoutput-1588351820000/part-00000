Nevertheless, it is typically by comparison to the groups and families that comprise the [[Sicilian Mafia]] that other criminal groups are given the label. [[Giovanni Falcone]], an anti-Mafia judge murdered by the Sicilian Mafia in 1992, objected to the conflation of the term \"Mafia\" with organized crime in general:\n{{quote|While there was a time when people were reluctant to pronounce the word \"Mafia\"&nbsp;... nowadays people have gone so far in the opposite direction that it has become an overused term&nbsp;... I am no longer willing to accept the habit of speaking of the Mafia in descriptive and all-inclusive terms that make it possible to stack up phenomena that are indeed related to the field of organized crime but that have little or nothing in common with the Mafia.<ref>Lupo, ''History of the Mafia'', pp. 1\u20132</ref>|[[Giovanni Falcone]], 1990}}\n\n===Mafias as private protection firms===\nScholars such as [[Diego Gambetta]]<ref>Diego Gambetta (1993). ''The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection''</ref> and [[Leopoldo Franchetti]] have characterized the Sicilian Mafia as a \"cartel of private protection firms\", whose primary business is [[protection racket]]eering: they use their fearsome reputation for violence to deter people from swindling, robbing, or competing with those who pay them for protection. For many businessmen in Sicily, they provide an essential service when they cannot rely on the police and judiciary to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves (this is often because they are engaged in [[black market]] deals). Scholars have observed that many other societies around the world have criminal organizations of their own that provide essentially the same protection service through similar methods.\n\nFor instance, in Russia after the collapse of Communism, the state security system had all but collapsed, forcing businessmen to hire criminal gangs to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves. These gangs are popularly called \"the Russian Mafia\" by foreigners, but they prefer to go by the term ''[[Russian mafia|krysha]]''.\n{{quote|With the [Russian] state in collapse and the security forces overwhelmed and unable to police contract law, [...] cooperating with the criminal culture was the only option. [...] most businessmen had to find themselves a reliable ''krysha'' under the leadership of an effective [[Thief in law|''vor'']].|excerpt from ''McMafia'' by [[Misha Glenny]].<ref name=Glenny2008>{{harvnb|Glenny|2008}}</ref>}}\n\nIn his analysis of the Sicilian Mafia, Gambetta provided the following hypothetical scenario to illustrate the Mafia's function in the Sicilian economy.  Suppose a grocer wants to buy meat from a butcher without paying sales tax to the government. Because this is a black market deal, neither party can take the other to court if the other cheats.  The grocer is afraid that the butcher will sell him rotten meat.  The butcher is afraid that the grocer will not pay him.  If the butcher and the grocer can't get over their mistrust and refuse to trade, they would both miss out on an opportunity for profit.  Their solution is to ask the local mafioso to oversee the transaction, in exchange for a fee proportional to the value of the transaction but below the legal tax. If the butcher cheats the grocer by selling rotten meat, the mafioso will punish the butcher. If the grocer cheats the butcher by not paying on time and in full, the mafioso will punish the grocer. Punishment might take the form of a violent assault or vandalism against property. The grocer and the butcher both fear the mafioso, so each honors their side of the bargain.  All three parties profit.\n\n===Mafia-type organizations under Italian law===\nIntroduced by [[Pio La Torre]], article 416-bis of the Italian Penal Code defines a [[Mafia-type association]] (''Associazione di Tipo Mafioso'') as one where \"those belonging to the association exploit the potential for intimidation which their membership gives them, and the compliance and [[omert\u00e0]] which membership entails and which lead to the committing of crimes, the direct or indirect assumption of management or control of financial activities, concessions, permissions, enterprises and public services for the purpose of deriving profit or wrongful advantages for themselves or others.\"<ref name=seindal>Seindal, ''Mafia: money and politics in Sicily'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJf-oKqos1YC&lpg=PA20 p. 20]</ref><ref>[http://www.camera.it/_bicamerali/leg15/commbicantimafia/files/pdf/Art_416bis.pdf Art. 416-bis, Codice Penale - Associazione di Tipo mafioso]</ref>\n\n==International==\nMafia-proper can refer to either:\n*[[American Mafia]]\n*[[Sicilian Mafia]] (aka \"[[Cosa Nostra]]\")\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:65393-Mafia Italian 2010ean.svg|thumbnail|Map of Italy's main criminal syndicates.]]\nOther Italian criminal organizations include:\n*[[Banda della Comasina]], in [[Lombardy]]\n*[[Banda della Magliana]] and [[Mafia Capitale]], in [[Lazio]]\n*[[Basilischi]], in [[Basilicata]]\n*[[Camorra]], in [[Campania]]\n*[[Mala del Brenta]], in [[Veneto]]\n*[['Ndrangheta]], in [[Calabria]]<ref>[http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2017/05/04/news/cosi-carlo-giovanardi-minacciava-i-carabinieri-1.300967 Il senatore Carlo Giovanardi difendeva un'azienda di amici che era colpita da interdittiva antimafia, L'Espresso, 4 maggio 2017]</ref>\n*[[Sacra Corona Unita]], in [[Apulia]]\n*[[Stidda]], in [[Sicily]]\n\n===Other countries===\n''See also [[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*Albanese, Jay S., Das, Dilip K. & Verma, Arvind (2003).

The word made its first official appearance in 1865 in a report by the prefect of [[Palermo]] {{interlanguage link|Filippo Antonio Gualterio (politician)|lt=Filippo Antonio Gualterio|it|Filippo Antonio Gualterio (politico)}}.<ref name=lupo3>Lupo, ''[http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13134-6/history-of-the-mafia/excerpt The History of the Mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106225220/http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13134-6/history-of-the-mafia/excerpt |date=2013-01-06 }}'', p. 3.</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nThe term \"mafia\" was never officially used by Sicilian mafiosi, who prefer to refer to their organization as \"[[Cosa Nostra]]\". Nevertheless, it is typically by comparison to the groups and families that comprise the [[Sicilian Mafia]] that other criminal groups are given the label. [[Giovanni Falcone]], an anti-Mafia judge murdered by the Sicilian Mafia in 1992, objected to the conflation of the term \"Mafia\" with organized crime in general:\n{{quote|While there was a time when people were reluctant to pronounce the word \"Mafia\"&nbsp;... nowadays people have gone so far in the opposite direction that it has become an overused term&nbsp;... I am no longer willing to accept the habit of speaking of the Mafia in descriptive and all-inclusive terms that make it possible to stack up phenomena that are indeed related to the field of organized crime but that have little or nothing in common with the Mafia.<ref>Lupo, ''History of the Mafia'', pp. 1\u20132</ref>|[[Giovanni Falcone]], 1990}}\n\n===Mafias as private protection firms===\nScholars such as [[Diego Gambetta]]<ref>Diego Gambetta (1993). ''The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection''</ref> and [[Leopoldo Franchetti]] have characterized the Sicilian Mafia as a \"cartel of private protection firms\", whose primary business is [[protection racket]]eering: they use their fearsome reputation for violence to deter people from swindling, robbing, or competing with those who pay them for protection. For many businessmen in Sicily, they provide an essential service when they cannot rely on the police and judiciary to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves (this is often because they are engaged in [[black market]] deals). Scholars have observed that many other societies around the world have criminal organizations of their own that provide essentially the same protection service through similar methods.\n\nFor instance, in Russia after the collapse of Communism, the state security system had all but collapsed, forcing businessmen to hire criminal gangs to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves. These gangs are popularly called \"the Russian Mafia\" by foreigners, but they prefer to go by the term ''[[Russian mafia|krysha]]''.\n{{quote|With the [Russian] state in collapse and the security forces overwhelmed and unable to police contract law, [...] cooperating with the criminal culture was the only option. [...] most businessmen had to find themselves a reliable ''krysha'' under the leadership of an effective [[Thief in law|''vor'']].|excerpt from ''McMafia'' by [[Misha Glenny]].<ref name=Glenny2008>{{harvnb|Glenny|2008}}</ref>}}\n\nIn his analysis of the Sicilian Mafia, Gambetta provided the following hypothetical scenario to illustrate the Mafia's function in the Sicilian economy.  Suppose a grocer wants to buy meat from a butcher without paying sales tax to the government. Because this is a black market deal, neither party can take the other to court if the other cheats.  The grocer is afraid that the butcher will sell him rotten meat.  The butcher is afraid that the grocer will not pay him.  If the butcher and the grocer can't get over their mistrust and refuse to trade, they would both miss out on an opportunity for profit.  Their solution is to ask the local mafioso to oversee the transaction, in exchange for a fee proportional to the value of the transaction but below the legal tax. If the butcher cheats the grocer by selling rotten meat, the mafioso will punish the butcher. If the grocer cheats the butcher by not paying on time and in full, the mafioso will punish the grocer. Punishment might take the form of a violent assault or vandalism against property. The grocer and the butcher both fear the mafioso, so each honors their side of the bargain.  All three parties profit.\n\n===Mafia-type organizations under Italian law===\nIntroduced by [[Pio La Torre]], article 416-bis of the Italian Penal Code defines a [[Mafia-type association]] (''Associazione di Tipo Mafioso'') as one where \"those belonging to the association exploit the potential for intimidation which their membership gives them, and the compliance and [[omert\u00e0]] which membership entails and which lead to the committing of crimes, the direct or indirect assumption of management or control of financial activities, concessions, permissions, enterprises and public services for the purpose of deriving profit or wrongful advantages for themselves or others.\"<ref name=seindal>Seindal, ''Mafia: money and politics in Sicily'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJf-oKqos1YC&lpg=PA20 p. 20]</ref><ref>[http://www.camera.it/_bicamerali/leg15/commbicantimafia/files/pdf/Art_416bis.pdf Art. 416-bis, Codice Penale - Associazione di Tipo mafioso]</ref>\n\n==International==\nMafia-proper can refer to either:\n*[[American Mafia]]\n*[[Sicilian Mafia]] (aka \"[[Cosa Nostra]]\")\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:65393-Mafia Italian 2010ean.svg|thumbnail|Map of Italy's main criminal syndicates.]]\nOther Italian criminal organizations include:\n*[[Banda della Comasina]], in [[Lombardy]]\n*[[Banda della Magliana]] and [[Mafia Capitale]], in [[Lazio]]\n*[[Basilischi]], in [[Basilicata]]\n*[[Camorra]], in [[Campania]]\n*[[Mala del Brenta]], in [[Veneto]]\n*[['Ndrangheta]], in [[Calabria]]<ref>[http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2017/05/04/news/cosi-carlo-giovanardi-minacciava-i-carabinieri-1.300967 Il senatore Carlo Giovanardi difendeva un'azienda di amici che era colpita da interdittiva antimafia, L'Espresso, 4 maggio 2017]</ref>\n*[[Sacra Corona Unita]], in [[Apulia]]\n*[[Stidda]], in [[Sicily]]\n\n===Other countries===\n''See also [[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*Albanese, Jay S., Das, Dilip K. & Verma, Arvind (2003).
