Based on Riefenstahl's earlier fascination with strong, healthy human bodies and her propaganda films for the [[government of Nazi Germany]] during the 20s and 30s, Sontag scrutinized the \"fascist aesthetics\" of these photo books in her widely read essay \"Fascinating Fascism\". Writing in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' in 1975, she stated: \"The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets\".

The idea for this group was to have an easily accessible, virtual place for all interested photographers to meet and share ideas. In 2012, they decided to focus seriously on the art of photography and found a partner for setting up workshops in the German cultural centre in Khartoum. These workshops were conducted by invited professional photographers from Germany, South Africa and other African countries and repeated for several years. with assignments and meetings of the photographers in between. Out of these efforts for continuing training, photo exhibitions called Mugran Photo Week<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.goethe.de/ins/su/en/kul/sup/mug.html|title=MUGRAN FOTO WEEK 2016 \u2013 PHOTO EXHIBITION MODERN TIMES \u2013 Goethe-Institut Sudan|website=www.goethe.de|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> were organized. Since then, some of the largely self-taught photographers have been invited to international exhibitions like the [[African Photography Encounters]] in Bamako, and some of the photographers have received grants to study abroad. One example for this are the ''Centers of Learning for Photography in Africa (CLPA)'', a growing network of independent photography training structures that have included photographers like Ala Kheir and others from Sudan, as well as photographers from other African countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.contemporaryand.com/de/magazines/launch-of-the-first-phase-of-the-survey-on-photography-training-and-learning-initiatives-on-the-african-continent/|title=Launch of the first phase of the \u201aSurvey on Photography Training and Learning Initiatives on the African Continent\u2018 {{!}} Contemporary And|website=www.contemporaryand.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial challenges and political expression through photography ===\n\n[[File:Alaa Salah by Lana H.

Only few companies are spending money on local photographs for print products or billboards, and this applies to commercial marketing on the internet as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtn.sd/home/|title=Welcome to MTN Sudan {{!}} MTN Sudan|website=www.mtn.sd|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> The other commercial sector that presents opportunities for commercial photographers and [[Videography|video artists]] are photographing [[newlywed]]s and their families.

The importance of photographs for such expressions of political participation became evident by the iconic picture of Sudanese student [[Alaa Salah]], who gained world-wide media attention through a picture of her taken during the [[Sudanese Revolution|Sudanese revolution]] in 2019 by amateur photographer Lana Haroun on her smartphone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/09/africa/photo-woman-chanting-sudan-uprising-scli-intl/index.html|title=This woman has come to symbolize Sudan's protests|author=Gianluca Mezzofiore|website=CNN|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, a photograph by Japanese photographer [[Yasuyoshi Chiba]] of [[Agence France-Presse]], showing a young man in Khartoum reciting protest poetry while demonstrators chant slogans calling for civilian rule, was selected as [[World Press Photo of the Year]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2020/39852/1/Yasuyoshi-Chiba-POY|title=Yasuyoshi Chiba {{!}} World Press Photo|website=www.worldpressphoto.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n== Notable Sudanese photographers ==\n[[File:Dialoge 4.jpg|thumb|left|\"Man of the Modern World\" by Mohamed Noureldin Abdallah, 1994]]\n[[File:DSC 2348-wiki.jpg|thumb|Fishing on the river Nile, by Eythar Gubara]]\n\nSome of the notable contemporary Sudanese photographers include the photojournalists Mohamed Noureldin Abdallah, who has covered Sudan for [[Reuters]] multimedia news for more than 15 years and also is known for his imaginary [[fine-art photography]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/mohamed-nureldin-abdallah|title=Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah|last=Abdallah|first=Mohamed Nureldin|website=The Wider Image|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> and Ashraf Shazly,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/ashraf-shazly?sort=best&mediatype=photography&phrase=ashraf%20shazly|title=World's Best Ashraf Shazly Stock Pictures, Photos, and Images \u2013 Getty Images|website=www.gettyimages.com|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> who works for [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]/[[Getty Images]].\n\nOther notable photographers are Ala Kheir,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alakheir.com/|title=Ala Kheir|website=Ala Kheir|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> Mohamed Altoum,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/lens/nubian-culture-ancestry-sudan.html|title=A Photographer\u2019s Quest to Discover His Nubian Ancestry|last=Altoum|first=Mohamed|date=2019-03-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-26|last2=Estrin|first2=James|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Hisham Karouri, Sharaf Mahzoub, Nagi Elhussain, Sari Omer, Atif Saad, Muhammad Salah,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arabdocphotography.org/project/i-want-to-be-visible|title=I Want To Be Visible {{!}} Arab Documentary Photography Program|website=arabdocphotography.org|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> Wael Al Sanosi aka Wellyce, Ahmad Abushakeema<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thisisafrica.me/arts-and-culture/photography-thousand-faces-modern-sudan/|title=Photography: a thousand faces of modern Sudan|last=Opaluwa|first=Ladi|date=2016-07-08|website=This is africa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> and the female photographers Ola Alsheikh,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44937742|title='I'm a woman with a camera \u2013 it surprises people'|date=2018-08-22|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en-GB}}</ref> Salma Alnour,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salmaalnour.wordpress.com/photos/|title=Salma Alnour|website=Salma Alnour|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> Soleyma Osman, Duha Mohamed, Eythar Gubara.<ref>This list is by no means complete, but wants to name some of the most active and visible Sudanese photographers of today.
