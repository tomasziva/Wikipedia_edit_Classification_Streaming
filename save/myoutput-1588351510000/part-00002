Based on a short story by [[J. W. Drawbell]], the film is about a concert pianist who, after learning that she is dying of heart failure, decides to spend her last days in [[Cornwall]]. While there, she meets a former [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot who is going blind, and soon a romantic attraction forms.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|title=Love Story |work=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037029/ |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Released in the United States as ''A Lady Surrenders'',<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1947/06/20/archives/english-move-in-with-slow-drama.html English Move In With Slow Drama] (June 20, 1947).

She applies to be a RAF [[Women Airforce Service Pilots|WASP]], but is rejected for health reasons. She then learns that she has a heart condition and does not have long to live.\n\nDetermined to live her final months fully, she goes to a resort in [[Cornwall]]. Not wanting to be recognised, she introduces herself as Lissa. She is soon befriended by Tom Tanner ([[Tom Walls]]), a salty old Yorkshireman, on government assignment to investigate mines. He sees her sadness, but does not pry.\n\nShe meets Kit Firth ([[Stewart Granger]]), a brash young engineer, and they form an association. She does not know Kit will soon be blind due to a war injury. The only one who knows is Judy ([[Patricia Roc]]), his childhood friend who is secretly in love with him. Meanwhile, Tom arranges for a piano for Lissa and she begins composing, inspired by her new environment and by Kit. Later, Kit introduces Lissa to Judy, who is working on an open-air play. Judy persuades Tom to invest in her production of ''The Tempest''.\n\nKit and Lissa's romance grows but, whenever things become serious, Kit backs away. Lissa grows increasingly frustrated, especially after he refuses Tom's offer to supervise the reopening of a mine in which Kit has found much-needed [[molybdenum]], and she finally breaks up with him. Kit confesses to Judy that he has never met anyone as understanding as Lissa.\n\nThe next day, a mining accident traps Tom and his crew. When Kit descends the mine, he too becomes trapped but is able to escape and rescue them, proving he is not a coward. When Lissa finds him practising reading [[Braille]], everything falls into place. She urges him to have surgery, but he says the doctors said his chances of surviving it were 100 to one, and that Judy had talked him out of it.\n\nLissa gets Judy to admit she views blindness as a godsend; Kit would have to turn to her. They agree Lissa will leave him if Judy persuades Kit to have the operation. After Kit leaves for surgery, Judy and her company prepare for their play. For the premiere, Judy is unable to go on until she hears the results of the imminent surgery. Lissa placates the audience for the delay by performing her new composition inspired by Kit. During her performance, she is overwhelmed by the same fear, and faints.\n\nWhen Lissa recovers, she is reassured that Kit is well. When Judy thanks her for giving up Kit, Lissa admits that she is not giving up much\u2014because she is dying. True to her word, she says goodbye to Kit, saying she will be going on a world tour and may not see him again. Despite his profession of love, Lissa leaves, heartbroken. In the coming weeks, Lissa travels the world, entertaining the troops. Meanwhile, Kit proposes to Judy and she accepts, but their relationship lacks passion. Despite Tom's advice to her to accept the truth and not cheat another woman out of the love she deserves, Judy insists she will not give up Kit.\n\nSometime later, Lissa is performing at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. After her final number, she spots Kit in the wings in his RAF uniform, and runs into his arms before fainting. When she recovers, she sees Judy. Recognizing he will always love Lissa, Judy announces, to Kit's surprise, that they will not be getting married\u2014Kit never belonged to her. Lissa finally reveals she only has months to live. Kit tells her they must take what happiness they can.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Margaret Lockwood]] as Lissa Campbell\n* [[Stewart Granger]] as Kit Firth\n* [[Patricia Roc]] as Judy\n* [[Tom Walls]] as Tom Tanner\n* [[Reginald Purdell]] as Albert\n* [[Walter Hudd]] as Ray\n* [[A.
