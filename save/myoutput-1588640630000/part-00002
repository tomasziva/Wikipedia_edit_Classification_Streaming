She is most notable for her [[glamour photography|glamour]] and [[cosplay]] [[Instagram model|modeling]] on [[Instagram]]. Her posts on the platform featured a risqu\u00e9 and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends. As a result of her online activity, she became an Internet meme in her own right.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Kirschner registered a joke [[Pornhub]] account and began selling her \"GamerGirl Bath Water\" product through her online store, garnering her a great amount of media coverage online. Shortly after, her Instagram account was deleted due to community guideline violations. Media outlets have described Kirschner as a cross between an [[Internet troll]] and a performance artist, as well as an [[e-girls and e-boys|e-girl]]. Kirschner has also been cited as an influence on the e-girl aesthetic commonly adopted by [[TikTok]] users.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years and developing an aesthetic===\nKirschner was born on 23 October 1999 in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and eventually moved to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=Sloan2019>{{cite web|last=Sloan|first=Elizabeth|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|title=Belle Delphine: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|work=[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720020343/https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/07/belle-delphine/|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=PopBuzz2019>{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|title=Belle Delphine: 12 Facts You (Probably) Didn't Know About The Online Star|work=[[Global (company)#Digital-only stations|PopBuzz]]|publisher=[[Global (company)|Global]]|date=2019|accessdate=31 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831210349/https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/belle-delphine/real-name/|archive-date=31 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Aggeler2019>{{cite web|last=Aggeler|first=Madeleine|url=https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|title=Who Is Belle Delphine, the Gamer Girl Selling Her Bathwater?|work=[[The Cut (blog)|The Cut]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713005639/https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/belle-delphine-bath-water.html|archive-date=13 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Kirschner has had an Instagram account since 2015,<ref name=Leskin2019-a>{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7|title=Meet Belle Delphine, the Instagram star who sold her bathwater to 'thirsty gamer boys' and had her account shut down over a rules violation|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=10 September 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008235928/https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7/|archive-date=8 October 2019|url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720150013/https://www.businessinsider.com/belle-delphine-instagram-bathwater-pornhub-2019-7|title=Meet Belle Delphine, the Instagram star who sold her bathwater to 'thirsty gamer boys' and had her account shut down over a rules violation [19 July 2019 archive]|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019|archive-date=19 July 2019}}</ref> and in July 2016, she registered a [[YouTube]] account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/about|title=belle delphine \u2013 YouTube about page|work=belle delphine|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=28 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729035941/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXvKUavCtDOlA8bT1i2tI3w/about|archive-date=29 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In August 2016, Kirschner uploaded a [[Beauty YouTuber|makeup tutorial video]], demonstrating how to do a [[eye shadow|cat-eye]].<ref name=Delphine2016>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r0Xe7ESrBE|title=My everyday makeup! {{pipe}} Belle|work=belle delphine|publisher=YouTube|date=14 August 2016|accessdate=28 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710011428/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r0Xe7ESrBE|archive-date=10 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Dickson2019>{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=EJ|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/belle-delphine-bathwater-gamer-girl-troll-857192/|title=Is Belle Delphine, a.k.a.

Her posts on the platform featured a risqu\u00e9 and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends.
