Light sources with a high CRI are desirable in color-critical applications such as [[neonatal]] care and art restoration. It is defined by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html |title=CIE 17.4-1987 International Lighting Vocabulary |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227034508/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Color rendering''': Effect of an illuminant on the color appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with their color appearance under a reference illuminant.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe CRI of a light source does not indicate the apparent color of the light source; that information is given by the [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT). The CRI is determined by the light source's [[spectrum]]. An [[incandescent lamp]] has a continuous spectrum, a [[fluorescent lamp]] has a discrete line spectrum; the incandescent lamp has the higher CRI.\n\nThe value often quoted as \"CRI\" on commercially available lighting products is properly called the CIE R<sub>a</sub> value, \"CRI\" being a general term and CIE R<sub>a</sub> being the international standard color rendering index.\n\nNumerically, the highest possible CIE R<sub>a</sub> value is 100 and would only be given to a source identical to standardized daylight or a [[black body]] (incandescent lamps are effectively black bodies), dropping to negative values for some light sources. [[Low-pressure sodium light]]ing has negative CRI; fluorescent lights range from about 50 for the basic types, up to about 98 for the best multi-phosphor type. Typical LEDs have a CRI of 80 or more, while some manufacturers claim that their LEDs have achieved CRI up to 98.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ledengin.com/files/products/LZC/LZC-00GW00.pdf |title=LZC-00GW00 Data Sheet |last= |first= |date=March 16, 2015 |website=ledengin.com |publisher=LED ENGIN |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105235216/http://www.ledengin.com/files/products/LZC/LZC-00GW00.pdf |archive-date=January 5, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCIE R<sub>a</sub>'s ability to predict color appearance has been criticized in favor of measures based on [[color appearance model]]s, such as [[CIECAM02]] and for [[daylight]] simulators, the CIE [[Metamerism Index]].<ref>{{citation |first1=J\u00e1nos |last1=Schanda |first2=Norbert |last2=S\u00e1ndor |journal=Lighting Research and Technology |volume=38 |issue=3 |title=Visual colour rendering based on colour difference evaluations |year=2005 |pages=225\u2013239 |doi=10.1191/1365782806lrt168oa}}.

In 1948, daylight was described as the ideal source of illumination for good color rendering because \"it (daylight) displays (1) a great variety of colours, (2) makes it easy to distinguish slight shades of colour, and (3) the colours of objects around us obviously look natural\".<ref>{{cite book |author=P.

European researchers attempted to describe illuminants by measuring the [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) in \"representative\" spectral bands, whereas their North American counterparts studied the [[colorimetric]] effect of the illuminants on reference objects.<ref>American approach is expounded in {{harvtxt|Nickerson|1960}}, and the European approach in {{harvtxt|Barnes|1957}}, and {{harvtxt|Crawford|1959}}.

Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]]. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the trichromatic nature of the [[human visual system]].<ref name=\"Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp; Application - Wiley Online Library\" >{{cite journal |authors=Rea, M.

This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type [[chromatic adaptation transform]].\n\n==Test method==\n\nThe CRI is calculated by comparing the color rendering of the test source to that of a \"perfect\" source, which is a black body radiator for sources with correlated color temperatures under 5000&nbsp;K, and a phase of daylight otherwise (e.g., [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]). [[Chromatic adaptation]] should be performed so that like quantities are compared.  The ''Test Method'' (also called ''Test Sample Method'' or ''Test Color Method'') needs only [[colorimetric]], rather than [[spectrophotometric]], information.<ref name=\"CIE1995\"/><ref>\n{{citation\n |title=Color rendering of light sources: CIE method of specification and its application\n |first1=Dorothy\n |last1=Nickerson\n |first2=Charles W.\n |last2=Jerome\n |journal=Illuminating Engineering\n |date=April 1965\n |pages=262\u2013271\n |volume=60\n |issue=4\n |publisher=[[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|IESNA]]\n }}</ref>\n\n[[File:CIE 1960 UCS.png|thumb|CIE 1960 UCS.

Accordingly, the updated general CRI is averaged over ten samples, not eight as before. Nevertheless, {{harvtxt|Hung|2002}} has determined that the patches in {{harvtxt|CIE|1995}} give better correlations for any color difference than the ColorChecker chart, whose samples are not equally distributed in a uniform color space.\n\n== Example ==\n\nThe CRI can also be theoretically derived from the SPD of the illuminant and samples, since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care should be taken to use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the standard test colors are tabulated in 5&nbsp;nm increments {{harvtxt|CIE|2004}}, so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant's spectrophotometry.\n\nStarting with the SPD, let us verify that the CRI of reference illuminant F4 is 51. The first step is to determine the [[tristimulus value]]s using the 1931 standard observer. Calculation of the [[inner product]] of the SPD with the standard observer's color matching functions (CMFs) yields (''X'',&nbsp;''Y'',&nbsp;''Z'') = (109.2,&nbsp;100.0,&nbsp;38.9) (after normalizing for ''Y''&nbsp;= 100). From this follow the ''xy'' chromaticity values:\n\n[[Image:CIE 1960 UCS, FL4.svg|thumb|right|200px|The tight isotherms are from 2935&nbsp;K to 2945&nbsp;K. FL4 marked with a cross.]]\n\n: <math>x = \\frac{109.2}{109.2 + 100.0 + 38.9} = 0.4402,</math>\n\n: <math>y = \\frac{100}{109.2 + 100.0 + 38.9} = 0.4031.</math>\n\nThe next step is to convert these chromaticities to the [[CIE 1960 color space|CIE 1960 UCS]] in order to be able to determine the CCT:\n\n: <math>u = \\frac{4 \\times 0.4402}{-2 \\times 0.4402 + 12 \\times 0.4031 + 3} = 0.2531,</math>\n\n: <math>v = \\frac{6 \\times 0.4031}{-2 \\times 0.4402 + 12 \\times 0.4031 + 3} = 0.3477.</math>\n\n[[Image:CIE illuminant F4 and a blackbody of 2938K.svg|thumb|200px|Relative SPD of FL4 and a black body of equal CCT. Not normalized.]]\n\nExamining the CIE 1960 UCS reveals this point to be closest to 2938&nbsp;K on the Planckian locus, which has a coordinate of (0.2528,&nbsp;0.3484). The distance of the test point to the locus is under the limit (5.4\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>), so we can continue the procedure, assured of a meaningful result:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n \\text{DC} &= \\sqrt{(0.2531 - 0.2528)^2 + (0.3477 - 0.3484)^2} \\\\\n           &= 8.12 \\times 10^{-4} < 5.4 \\times 10^{-3}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWe can verify the CCT by using [[Color temperature#Approximation|McCamy's approximation algorithm]] to estimate the CCT from the ''xy'' chromaticities:\n\n: <math>\\text{CCT}_\\text{est.} = -449 n^3 + 3525 n^2 - 6823.3 n + 5520.33,</math>\n\nwhere <math>n = \\frac{x - 0.3320}{y - 0.1858}</math>.\n\nSubstituting <math>(x, y) = (0.4402, 0.4031)</math> yields ''n''&nbsp;= 0.4979 and CCT<sub>est.</sub>&nbsp;= 2941&nbsp;K, which is close enough. ([[Color temperature#Robertson's method|Robertson's method]] can be used for greater precision, but we will be content with 2940&nbsp;K in order to replicate published results.) Since 2940&nbsp;< 5000, we select a Planckian radiator of 2940&nbsp;K as the reference illuminant.\n\nThe next step is to determine the values of the test color samples under each illuminant in the [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW color space]]. This is done by integrating the product of the CMF with the SPDs of the illuminant and the sample, then converting from CIEXYZ to CIEUVW (with the ''u'',&nbsp;''v'' coordinates of the reference illuminant as white point):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Illuminant || TCS1 || TCS2 || TCS3 || TCS4 || TCS5 || TCS6 || TCS7 || TCS8\n|-\n! rowspan = 3 | Reference\n!

This is why [[incandescent lamp]]s have that rating, as they are, in effect, almost blackbody radiators. The best possible faithfulness to a reference is specified by CRI&nbsp;= 100, while the very poorest is specified by a CRI below zero. A high CRI by itself does not imply a good rendition of color, because the reference itself may have an imbalanced SPD if it has an extreme color temperature.\n\n== Special value: R9 ==\n\nR<sub>a</sub> is the average value of R1\u2013R8, other values from R9 to R15 are missing in R<sub>a</sub> calculation, including R9 \"saturated red\", R13 \"skin color (light)\", and R15 \"skin color (medium)\", which are all difficult colors to faithfully reproduce. R9 is a vital index in high-CRI lighting, as many applications require red lights, such as film and video lighting, medical lighting, art lighting, etc. However, in general CRI (R<sub>a</sub>) calculation, R9 is not included.\n\nR9 is one of the numbers of R<sub>i</sub> refers to test color samples (TCS), which is one score in extended CRI. It is the number rates the light source\u2019s color revealing ability towards TCS&nbsp;09. And it describes the specific ability of light to accurately reproduce the red color of objects. Many lights manufacturers or retailers do not point out the score of R9, while it is a vital value to evaluate the color rendition performance for film and video lighting, as well as any applications that need high CRI value. So, generally, it is regarded as a supplement of color rendering index when evaluating a high-CRI light source.\n\nR9 value, TCS&nbsp;09, or in other words, the red color is the key color for many lighting applications, such as film and video lighting, textile printing, image printing, skin tone, medical lighting, and so on. Besides, many other objects which are not in red color, but actually consists of different colors including red color. For instance, the skin tone is impacted by the blood under the skin, which means that the skin tone also includes red color, although it looks much like close to white or light yellow. So, if the R9 value is not good enough, the skin tone under this light will be more paleness or even greenish in your eyes or cameras.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mmsvideolight.com/why-r9-is-important-for-high-cri-lighting/ |title=Why R9 is important for High CRI Lighting?}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nOhno and others have criticized CRI for not always correlating well with subjective color rendering quality in practice, particularly for light sources with spiky emission spectra such as fluorescent lamps or white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s. Another problem is that the CRI is discontinuous at 5000&nbsp;K,<ref>\"Authors\u2019 response to SA Fotios and JA Lynes\" in {{harvtxt|Schanda|S\u00e1ndor|2005}}: ''It is quite obvious that just at 5000&nbsp;K, where the reference illuminant has to be changed, the present system shows discontinuity.''</ref> because the chromaticity of the reference moves from the [[Planckian locus]] to the [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant series D|CIE daylight locus]]. {{harvtxt|Davis|Ohno|2006}} identify several other issues, which they address in their [[Color Quality Scale]] (CQS):\n* The color space in which the color distance is calculated (CIEUVW) is obsolete and nonuniform. Use [[CIELAB]] or [[CIELUV]] instead.\n* The chromatic adaptation transform used ([[Von Kries transform]]) is inadequate. Use [[CIECAM02#Chromatic adaptation|CMCCAT2000]] or [[CIECAM02|CIECAT02]] instead.\n* Calculating the arithmetic mean of the errors diminishes the contribution of any single large deviation. Two light sources with similar CRI may perform significantly differently if one has a particularly low special CRI in a spectral band that is important for the application. Use the [[root-mean-square deviation]] instead.\n* The metric is not perceptual; all errors are equally weighted, whereas humans favor certain errors over others. A color can be more saturated or less saturated without a change in the numerical value of \u2206''E''<sub>''i''</sub>, while in general a saturated color is experienced as being more attractive.\n* A negative CRI is difficult to interpret. Normalize the scale from 0 to 100 using the formula <math>R_\\text{out} = 10 \\ln \\left[\\exp(R_\\text{in}/10) + 1\\right]</math>.\n* The CRI cannot be calculated for light sources that do not have a CCT (non-white light).\n* Eight samples are not enough since manufacturers can optimize the emission spectra of their lamps to reproduce them faithfully, but otherwise perform poorly. Use more samples (they suggest fifteen for CQS).\n* The samples are not saturated enough to pose difficulty for reproduction.\n* CRI merely measures the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source with the same CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, due to a lack of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the [[gamut]] area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500&nbsp;K to the gamut area for the test source. 6500&nbsp;K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area. This normalizes the multiplication factor.\n\nRea and Freyssinier have developed another index, the Gamut Area Index (GAI), in an attempt to improve over the flaws found in the CRI.<ref>Rea, M.\u00a0S. and Freysinnier-Nova, J.\u00a0P. \"Color rendering: A tale of two metrics\", Color Research and Application, 33(3), 192\u2013202 (2008). {{doi|10.1002/col.20399}}.</ref> They have shown that the GAI is better than the CRI at predicting color discrimination on standardized Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Tests and that GAI is predictive of color saturation.<ref name=\"Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp; Application - Wiley Online Library\" /> Proponents of using GAI claim that, when used in conjunction with CRI, this method of evaluating color rendering is preferred by test subjects over light sources that have high values of only one measure. Researchers recommend a lower and an upper limit to GAI. Use of LED technology has called for a new way to evaluate color rendering because of the unique spectrum of light created by these technologies. Preliminary tests have shown that the combination of GAI and CRI used together is a preferred method for evaluating color rendering.<ref>Alliance for Solid-State Illumination Systems and Technologies. \"ASSIST recommends\u2026Guide to Light and Color in Retail Merchandising\", 8(1), (2010).

Light sources with a high CRI are desirable in color-critical applications such as [[neonatal]] care and art restoration. It is defined by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html |title=CIE 17.4-1987 International Lighting Vocabulary |access-date=2008-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227034508/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Color rendering''': Effect of an illuminant on the color appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with their color appearance under a reference illuminant.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe CRI of a light source does not indicate the apparent color of the light source; that information is given by the [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT). The CRI is determined by the light source's [[spectrum]]. An [[incandescent lamp]] has a continuous spectrum, a [[fluorescent lamp]] has a discrete line spectrum; the incandescent lamp has the higher CRI.\n\nThe value often quoted as \"CRI\" on commercially available lighting products is properly called the CIE R<sub>a</sub> value, \"CRI\" being a general term and CIE R<sub>a</sub> being the international standard color rendering index.\n\nNumerically, the highest possible CIE R<sub>a</sub> value is 100 and would only be given to a source identical to standardized daylight or a [[black body]] (incandescent lamps are effectively black bodies), dropping to negative values for some light sources. [[Low-pressure sodium light]]ing has negative CRI; fluorescent lights range from about 50 for the basic types, up to about 98 for the best multi-phosphor type. Typical LEDs have a CRI of 80 or more, while some manufacturers claim that their LEDs have achieved CRI up to 98.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ledengin.com/files/products/LZC/LZC-00GW00.pdf |title=LZC-00GW00 Data Sheet |last= |first= |date=March 16, 2015 |website=ledengin.com |publisher=LED ENGIN |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105235216/http://www.ledengin.com/files/products/LZC/LZC-00GW00.pdf |archive-date=January 5, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCIE R<sub>a</sub>'s ability to predict color appearance has been criticized in favor of measures based on [[color appearance model]]s, such as [[CIECAM02]] and for [[daylight]] simulators, the CIE [[Metamerism Index]].<ref>{{citation |first1=J\u00e1nos |last1=Schanda |first2=Norbert |last2=S\u00e1ndor |journal=Lighting Research and Technology |volume=38 |issue=3 |title=Visual colour rendering based on colour difference evaluations |year=2005 |pages=225\u2013239 |doi=10.1191/1365782806lrt168oa}}.

In 1948, daylight was described as the ideal source of illumination for good color rendering because \"it (daylight) displays (1) a great variety of colours, (2) makes it easy to distinguish slight shades of colour, and (3) the colours of objects around us obviously look natural\".<ref>{{cite book |author=P.

European researchers attempted to describe illuminants by measuring the [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) in \"representative\" spectral bands, whereas their North American counterparts studied the [[colorimetric]] effect of the illuminants on reference objects.<ref>American approach is expounded in {{harvtxt|Nickerson|1960}}, and the European approach in {{harvtxt|Barnes|1957}}, and {{harvtxt|Crawford|1959}}. See {{harvtxt|Schanda|S\u00e1ndor|2003}} for a historical overview.</ref>\n\nThe [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] assembled a committee to study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing [[spectrophotometry]], with a set of [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]]. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the trichromatic nature of the [[human visual system]].<ref name=\"Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp; Application - Wiley Online Library\" >{{cite journal |authors=Rea, M.\u00a0S., Freyssinier, J.\u00a0P. |title=Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice |journal=Color Research and Application |year=2010 |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=401\u2013409 |doi=10.1002/col.20562}}</ref><ref>http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/solidstate/assist/pdf/AR-ColorGuideforRetailLighting-March2010.pdf</ref> CRI is based upon this system of colorimetry.<ref>Rea M., L.

This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type [[chromatic adaptation transform]].\n\n==Test method==\n\nThe CRI is calculated by comparing the color rendering of the test source to that of a \"perfect\" source, which is a black body radiator for sources with correlated color temperatures under 5000&nbsp;K, and a phase of daylight otherwise (e.g., [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]). [[Chromatic adaptation]] should be performed so that like quantities are compared.  The ''Test Method'' (also called ''Test Sample Method'' or ''Test Color Method'') needs only [[colorimetric]], rather than [[spectrophotometric]], information.<ref name=\"CIE1995\"/><ref>\n{{citation\n |title=Color rendering of light sources: CIE method of specification and its application\n |first1=Dorothy\n |last1=Nickerson\n |first2=Charles W.\n |last2=Jerome\n |journal=Illuminating Engineering\n |date=April 1965\n |pages=262\u2013271\n |volume=60\n |issue=4\n |publisher=[[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|IESNA]]\n }}</ref>\n\n[[File:CIE 1960 UCS.png|thumb|CIE 1960 UCS.

Accordingly, the updated general CRI is averaged over ten samples, not eight as before. Nevertheless, {{harvtxt|Hung|2002}} has determined that the patches in {{harvtxt|CIE|1995}} give better correlations for any color difference than the ColorChecker chart, whose samples are not equally distributed in a uniform color space.\n\n== Example ==\n\nThe CRI can also be theoretically derived from the SPD of the illuminant and samples, since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care should be taken to use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the standard test colors are tabulated in 5&nbsp;nm increments {{harvtxt|CIE|2004}}, so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant's spectrophotometry.\n\nStarting with the SPD, let us verify that the CRI of reference illuminant F4 is 51. The first step is to determine the [[tristimulus value]]s using the 1931 standard observer. Calculation of the [[inner product]] of the SPD with the standard observer's color matching functions (CMFs) yields (''X'',&nbsp;''Y'',&nbsp;''Z'') = (109.2,&nbsp;100.0,&nbsp;38.9) (after normalizing for ''Y''&nbsp;= 100). From this follow the ''xy'' chromaticity values:\n\n[[Image:CIE 1960 UCS, FL4.svg|thumb|right|200px|The tight isotherms are from 2935&nbsp;K to 2945&nbsp;K. FL4 marked with a cross.]]\n\n: <math>x = \\frac{109.2}{109.2 + 100.0 + 38.9} = 0.4402,</math>\n\n: <math>y = \\frac{100}{109.2 + 100.0 + 38.9} = 0.4031.</math>\n\nThe next step is to convert these chromaticities to the [[CIE 1960 color space|CIE 1960 UCS]] in order to be able to determine the CCT:\n\n: <math>u = \\frac{4 \\times 0.4402}{-2 \\times 0.4402 + 12 \\times 0.4031 + 3} = 0.2531,</math>\n\n: <math>v = \\frac{6 \\times 0.4031}{-2 \\times 0.4402 + 12 \\times 0.4031 + 3} = 0.3477.</math>\n\n[[Image:CIE illuminant F4 and a blackbody of 2938K.svg|thumb|200px|Relative SPD of FL4 and a black body of equal CCT. Not normalized.]]\n\nExamining the CIE 1960 UCS reveals this point to be closest to 2938&nbsp;K on the Planckian locus, which has a coordinate of (0.2528,&nbsp;0.3484). The distance of the test point to the locus is under the limit (5.4\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>), so we can continue the procedure, assured of a meaningful result:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n \\text{DC} &= \\sqrt{(0.2531 - 0.2528)^2 + (0.3477 - 0.3484)^2} \\\\\n           &= 8.12 \\times 10^{-4} < 5.4 \\times 10^{-3}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWe can verify the CCT by using [[Color temperature#Approximation|McCamy's approximation algorithm]] to estimate the CCT from the ''xy'' chromaticities:\n\n: <math>\\text{CCT}_\\text{est.} = -449 n^3 + 3525 n^2 - 6823.3 n + 5520.33,</math>\n\nwhere <math>n = \\frac{x - 0.3320}{y - 0.1858}</math>.\n\nSubstituting <math>(x, y) = (0.4402, 0.4031)</math> yields ''n''&nbsp;= 0.4979 and CCT<sub>est.</sub>&nbsp;= 2941&nbsp;K, which is close enough. ([[Color temperature#Robertson's method|Robertson's method]] can be used for greater precision, but we will be content with 2940&nbsp;K in order to replicate published results.) Since 2940&nbsp;< 5000, we select a Planckian radiator of 2940&nbsp;K as the reference illuminant.\n\nThe next step is to determine the values of the test color samples under each illuminant in the [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW color space]]. This is done by integrating the product of the CMF with the SPDs of the illuminant and the sample, then converting from CIEXYZ to CIEUVW (with the ''u'',&nbsp;''v'' coordinates of the reference illuminant as white point):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Illuminant || TCS1 || TCS2 || TCS3 || TCS4 || TCS5 || TCS6 || TCS7 || TCS8\n|-\n! rowspan = 3 | Reference\n!

This is why [[incandescent lamp]]s have that rating, as they are, in effect, almost blackbody radiators. The best possible faithfulness to a reference is specified by CRI&nbsp;= 100, while the very poorest is specified by a CRI below zero. A high CRI by itself does not imply a good rendition of color, because the reference itself may have an imbalanced SPD if it has an extreme color temperature.\n\n== Special value: R9 ==\n\nR<sub>a</sub> is the average value of R1\u2013R8, other values from R9 to R15 are missing in R<sub>a</sub> calculation, including R9 \"saturated red\", R13 \"skin color (light)\", and R15 \"skin color (medium)\", which are all difficult colors to faithfully reproduce. R9 is a vital index in high-CRI lighting, as many applications require red lights, such as film and video lighting, medical lighting, art lighting, etc. However, in general CRI (R<sub>a</sub>) calculation, R9 is not included.\n\nR9 is one of the numbers of R<sub>i</sub> refers to test color samples (TCS), which is one score in extended CRI. It is the number rates the light source\u2019s color revealing ability towards TCS&nbsp;09. And it describes the specific ability of light to accurately reproduce the red color of objects. Many lights manufacturers or retailers do not point out the score of R9, while it is a vital value to evaluate the color rendition performance for film and video lighting, as well as any applications that need high CRI value. So, generally, it is regarded as a supplement of color rendering index when evaluating a high-CRI light source.\n\nR9 value, TCS&nbsp;09, or in other words, the red color is the key color for many lighting applications, such as film and video lighting, textile printing, image printing, skin tone, medical lighting, and so on. Besides, many other objects which are not in red color, but actually consists of different colors including red color. For instance, the skin tone is impacted by the blood under the skin, which means that the skin tone also includes red color, although it looks much like close to white or light yellow. So, if the R9 value is not good enough, the skin tone under this light will be more paleness or even greenish in your eyes or cameras.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mmsvideolight.com/why-r9-is-important-for-high-cri-lighting/ |title=Why R9 is important for High CRI Lighting?}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nOhno and others have criticized CRI for not always correlating well with subjective color rendering quality in practice, particularly for light sources with spiky emission spectra such as fluorescent lamps or white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s. Another problem is that the CRI is discontinuous at 5000&nbsp;K,<ref>\"Authors\u2019 response to SA Fotios and JA Lynes\" in {{harvtxt|Schanda|S\u00e1ndor|2005}}: ''It is quite obvious that just at 5000&nbsp;K, where the reference illuminant has to be changed, the present system shows discontinuity.''</ref> because the chromaticity of the reference moves from the [[Planckian locus]] to the [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant series D|CIE daylight locus]]. {{harvtxt|Davis|Ohno|2006}} identify several other issues, which they address in their [[Color Quality Scale]] (CQS):\n* The color space in which the color distance is calculated (CIEUVW) is obsolete and nonuniform. Use [[CIELAB]] or [[CIELUV]] instead.\n* The chromatic adaptation transform used ([[Von Kries transform]]) is inadequate. Use [[CIECAM02#Chromatic adaptation|CMCCAT2000]] or [[CIECAM02|CIECAT02]] instead.\n* Calculating the arithmetic mean of the errors diminishes the contribution of any single large deviation. Two light sources with similar CRI may perform significantly differently if one has a particularly low special CRI in a spectral band that is important for the application. Use the [[root-mean-square deviation]] instead.\n* The metric is not perceptual; all errors are equally weighted, whereas humans favor certain errors over others. A color can be more saturated or less saturated without a change in the numerical value of \u2206''E''<sub>''i''</sub>, while in general a saturated color is experienced as being more attractive.\n* A negative CRI is difficult to interpret. Normalize the scale from 0 to 100 using the formula <math>R_\\text{out} = 10 \\ln \\left[\\exp(R_\\text{in}/10) + 1\\right]</math>.\n* The CRI cannot be calculated for light sources that do not have a CCT (non-white light).\n* Eight samples are not enough since manufacturers can optimize the emission spectra of their lamps to reproduce them faithfully, but otherwise perform poorly. Use more samples (they suggest fifteen for CQS).\n* The samples are not saturated enough to pose difficulty for reproduction.\n* CRI merely measures the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source with the same CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, due to a lack of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the [[gamut]] area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500&nbsp;K to the gamut area for the test source. 6500&nbsp;K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area. This normalizes the multiplication factor.\n\nRea and Freyssinier have developed another index, the Gamut Area Index (GAI), in an attempt to improve over the flaws found in the CRI.<ref>Rea, M.\u00a0S. and Freysinnier-Nova, J.\u00a0P. \"Color rendering: A tale of two metrics\", Color Research and Application, 33(3), 192\u2013202 (2008). {{doi|10.1002/col.20399}}.</ref> They have shown that the GAI is better than the CRI at predicting color discrimination on standardized Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Tests and that GAI is predictive of color saturation.<ref name=\"Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp; Application - Wiley Online Library\" /> Proponents of using GAI claim that, when used in conjunction with CRI, this method of evaluating color rendering is preferred by test subjects over light sources that have high values of only one measure. Researchers recommend a lower and an upper limit to GAI. Use of LED technology has called for a new way to evaluate color rendering because of the unique spectrum of light created by these technologies. Preliminary tests have shown that the combination of GAI and CRI used together is a preferred method for evaluating color rendering.<ref>Alliance for Solid-State Illumination Systems and Technologies. \"ASSIST recommends\u2026Guide to Light and Color in Retail Merchandising\", 8(1), (2010).

The color spectra of LED lighting primary colors does not match the expected color wavelength bandpasses of film emulsions and digital sensors. As a result, color rendition can be completely unpredictable in optical prints, transfers to digital media from film (DIs), and video camera recordings. This phenomenon with respect to motion picture film has been documented in an LED lighting evaluation series of tests produced by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] scientific staff.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/solid-state-lighting-report\n | title = Solid State Lighting Report\n }}</ref>\n\nTo that end, various other metrics such as the TLCI (television lighting consistency index) have been developed to replace the human observer with a camera observer.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = https://tech.ebu.ch/tlci-2012\n | title = EBU Technology & Innovation - Television Lighting Consistency Index 2012\n }}</ref>  Similar to the CRI, the metric measures quality of a light source as it would appear on camera on a scale from 0 to 100.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.gtc.org.uk/tlci-results.aspx\n | title = The Guild of Television Cameramen: TLCI Results\n | access-date = 2014-08-28\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903072219/http://www.gtc.org.uk/tlci-results.aspx\n | archive-date = 2014-09-03\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> Some manufacturers say that their products have TLCI values of up to 99.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = https://www.yujiintl.com/film-lighting.html\n | title = High TLCI LEDs for Film and Photography\n }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n<!-- Harvard citations used.
