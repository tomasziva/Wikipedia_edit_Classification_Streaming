If you're looking for engaging singular tracks to fill your playlist, this album has several songs that could keep the band on radio for a long run. But if you're looking for a deeper connection and a full listening experience, ''Vessels'' truly takes the listener on a journey both musically and thematically, utilizing synths, drums, guitars and Bates' at times dreamlike, at other times aggressive vocal approach.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://loudwire.com/starset-vessels-album-review/ |title=Starset, 'Vessels' - Album Review |website=Loudwire.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n|title1   = The Order\n|writer1  = {{hlist|Dustin Bates}}\n|length1  = 1:06\n|title2   = [[Satellite (Starset song)|Satellite]]\n|writer2  = {{hlist|Bates|Joe Rickard}}\n|length2  = 3:59\n|title3   = Frequency\n|writer3  = {{hlist|Bates|Paul Trust|Rob Graves}}\n|length3  = 4:41\n|title4   = Die for You\n|writer4  = {{hlist|Bates|Daniel Ticotin}}\n|length4  = 5:17\n|title5   = Ricochet\n|writer5  = {{hlist|Bates|Rickard}}\n|length5  = 5:10\n|title6   = Starlight\n|writer6  = {{hlist|Bates|Ticotin}}\n|length6  = 4:46\n|title7   = Into the Unknown\n|writer7  = {{hlist|Bates|Mitch Marlow}}\n|length7  = 4:30\n|title8   = Gravity of You\n|writer8  = {{hlist|Bates|Josh Baker|Graves}}\n|length8  = 4:46\n|title9   = Back to the Earth\n|writer9  = {{hlist|Bates|Rickard}}\n|length9  = 4:13\n|title10   = Last to Fall\n|writer10  = {{hlist|Bates|Ticotin|Graves}}\n|length10  = 5:03\n|title11   = Bringing It Down\n|writer11  = {{hlist|Bates|Trust|Graves}}\n|length11  = 5:48\n|title12   = Unbecoming\n|writer12  = {{hlist|Bates|Baker}}\n|length12  = 4:10\n|title13   = [[Monster (Starset song)|Monster]]\n|writer13  = {{hlist|Bates|Johnny Andrews|Graves}}\n|length13  = 4:16\n|title14   = Telepathic\n|writer14  = {{hlist|Bates|Ticotin|Jeff Halavacs|Graves}}\n|length14  = 4:42\n|title15   = Everglow\n|writer15  = {{hlist|Bates|Rickard|Graves}}\n|length15  = 7:54\n|total_length = 70:21\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n|headline  = ''Vessels 2.0'' \u2013 Deluxe edition\n|collapsed = yes\n|title16   = Bringing It Down\n|note16    = Version 2.0\n|writer16  = {{hlist|Bates|Trust|Graves}}\n|length16  = 4:58\n|title17   = Die for You\n|note17    = acoustic version\n|writer17  = {{hlist|Bates|Ticotin}}\n|length17  = 4:30\n|title18   = Telepathic\n|note18    = acoustic version\n|writer18  = {{hlist|Bates|Ticotin|Halavacs|Graves}}\n|length18  = 3:51\n|title19   = Starlight\n|note19    = acoustic version\n|writer19  = {{hlist|Bates|Ticotin}}\n|length19  = 4:47\n|title20   = Ricochet\n|note20    = acoustic version\n|writer20  = {{hlist|Bates|Rickard}}\n|length20  = 4:52\n|title21   = Satellite\n|note21    = acoustic version\n|writer21  = {{hlist|Bates|Rickard}}\n|length21  = 3:50\n|title22   = Love You to Death\n|note22    = [[Type O Negative]] cover\n|writer22  = {{hlist|[[Peter Steele]]}}\n|length22  = 5:32\n|title23   = Telepathic\n|note23    = Not Your Dope remix\n|writer23  = {{hlist|Bates|Ticotin|Halavacs|Graves}}\n|length23  = 3:37\n|title24   = Satellite\n|note24    = TRAILS remix\n|writer24  = {{hlist|Bates|Rickard}}\n|length24  = 2:49\n|total_length = 109:07\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n=== Musicians ===\n* Dustin Bates \u2013 vocals, guitars, additional programming\n* Rob Graves \u2013 programming, guitars\n* Alex Niceforo \u2013 programming\n* [[Igor Khoroshev]] \u2013 programming, strings and orchestra arrangements\n* Josh Baker \u2013 additional programming\n* Paul Trust \u2013 additional programming\n* Ron DeChant \u2013 additional backing vocals\n* Joe Rickard \u2013 drums\n* David Davidson \u2013 violin\n* David Angell \u2013 violin\n* Elizabeth Lamb \u2013 viola\n* Anthony Lamarchina \u2013 cello\n\n=== Technical ===\n* Rob Graves \u2013 production, engineering\n* Ben Grosse \u2013 mixing\n* [[Bob Ludwig]] \u2013 mastering\n* Mike Plotnikoff \u2013 engineering\n* Justin Spotswood \u2013 engineering\n* Paul Decarli \u2013 digital editing\n* Joe Rickard \u2013 digital editing, additional pre-production\n* Josh Baker \u2013 additional pre-production\n* Sahaj Ticotin \u2013 additional pre-production\n* Paul Trust \u2013 additional pre-production\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
