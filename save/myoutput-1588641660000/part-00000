When a god is respected or worshipped by means of a representative animal, an animal cult is formed ([[#Reference-idTeeter2002|Teeter et al., 2002]], p.&nbsp;355). Animal cults may be classified according to their outward form or according to their inward meaning, which may of course undergo transformations ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nThe classical author Diodorus explained the origin of animal worship by recalling the myth in which the gods, supposedly threatened by giants, hid under the guise of animals. The people then naturally began to worship the animals that their gods had disguised themselves as and continued this act even after the gods returned to their normal state ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&nbsp;252). In 1906, Weissenborn suggested that animal worship resulted from man's natural curiosity. Primitive man would observe an animal that had a unique trait and the inexplicability of this trait would appeal to man's curiosity ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&nbsp;282). Wonder resulted from primitive man's observations of this distinctive trait and this wonder eventually induced adoration. Thus, primitive man worshipped animals that had inimitable traits ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&nbsp;282). Lubbock put forward a more recent view. Lubbock proposed that animal-worship originated from family names. In societies, families would name themselves and their children after certain animals and eventually came to hold that animal above other animals. Eventually, these opinions turned into deep respect and evolved into fully developed worship of the family animal ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&nbsp;253). The belief that an animal is sacred frequently results in [[Taboo food and drink|dietary laws]] prohibiting their consumption. As well as holding certain animals to be sacred, religions have also adopted the opposite attitude, that certain animals are [[unclean animals|unclean]].\n\nThe idea that divinity embodies itself in animals, such as a deity incarnate, and then lives on earth among human beings is disregarded by [[Abrahamic]] religions ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&nbsp;26). In [[Independent Assemblies of God]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, animals have very little religious significance ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Schoffeleers, 1985; Peltzer, 1987; Qtd. in Morris, 2000]], p.&nbsp;25). Animals have become less and less important and symbolic in cult rituals and religion, especially among African cultures, as Christianity and Islamic religions have spread. ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&nbsp;24).\n\nThe [[Egyptian pantheon]] was especially fond of [[zoomorphism]], with many animals sacred to particular deities\u2014[[cat]]s to [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]], [[ibis]]es and [[baboon]]s to [[Thoth]], [[crocodile]]s to [[Sobek]] and [[Ra]], fish to [[Set (mythology)|Set]], [[mongoose]], [[shrew]] and [[bird]]s to [[Horus]], dogs and [[jackal]]s to [[Anubis]], serpents and [[eel]]s to [[Atum]], [[beetle]]s to [[Khepera]], bulls to [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]]. Animals were often [[Animal Mummies|mummified]] as a result of these beliefs.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Hunting cults==\n===Bear===\n{{Main|Bear worship}}\nThere is evidence that connects the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as \"bears\" in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a [[nymph]] into a bear and then into the constellation [[Ursa Major]].\n\nThe existence of an ancient bear cult among Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic period has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&nbsp;434-435). Ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and their peculiar arrangement are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic era. ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&nbsp;435).\n\n[[Image:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[Iomante]]'' ceremony (bear sending). Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870.]]\nThe [[Ainu people]], who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear \"[[kamui]]\" in [[Ainu language|their language]], which translates to mean god. While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&nbsp;345). For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term \"kamui\" is used, it essentially means a bear ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&nbsp;345). The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&nbsp;348).\n\n===Whale===\n[[Image:B\u1ed9 c\u1ed1t c\u00e1 voi.jpg|right|thumb|The largest whale skeleton in Vietnam at [[:vi:V\u1ea1n Th\u1ee7y T\u00fa|V\u1ea1n Th\u1ee7y T\u00fa temple]], one of [[:vi:T\u1ee5c th\u1edd c\u00e1 \u00d4ng|Vietnamese Whale worship]] in [[Vietnamese folk religion]]s]]\n\nWhales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe ([[#Reference-idBird2007|Bird 2007]]). Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies.\n\nA prevalent [[whale]] cult in Japan occurs around the coastal area. There are cemeteries with memorial stones dedicated to the whales which were hunted and killed to feed the people ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;4).\nBuddhist epitaphs mark these stones which implore that Buddha be reborn as a whale ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;4). Along with these memorials, there is evidence that whale embryos, found in a deceased mother's womb, were extracted and buried with the same respect as a human being ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;5). For certain shrines, the bones of a perished whale were also deposited in the area ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;5).\n\nIn Alaska, there are cultures that have ceremonial tributes whales after they are captured in a hunt ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&nbsp;445). Some tribes bring the hump, the fins, or the nose of the whale into their camps or the whaler's house. These parts are meant to represent the entirety of the whale and are honored as such during the festival ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&nbsp;445). The bones of a whale are also given ritual treatment. The Alaskan tribes that participate in such acts believe that their ceremonies protect the whale's soul from injury and the soul can then be free to return to the sea ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&nbsp;445).\n\nIn China, ''Yu-kiang'', a whale with the hands and feet of a man was said to rule the ocean ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&nbsp;15\u201316).\n\nIn the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region of Austria, it was said that if a sunbeam were to fall on a maiden entering womanhood, she would be carried away in the belly of a whale ([[#Reference-idFrazer1913|Frazer 1913]], p.&nbsp;72).\n\n[[Paikea]] (also maori name for [[humpback whale]]s<ref name=Teara>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/14178|title=Te wh\u0101nau puha \u2013 whales \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=Teara.govt.nz|accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref>), the youngest and favourite son of the chief Uenuku from the island of [[Mangaia]], in the present day [[Cook Islands]], was said by the Kati Kuri people of [[Kaikoura]] to have come from the Pacific Islands on the back of ''Tohora'' (maori name for [[southern right whale]]s<ref name=Teara />) a whale many centuries before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/whales/EducationResource.aspx?irn=198|title=Whales|last=Anon|work=Tinirau education resource|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe whale features in [[Inuit]] [[creation myth]]s. When 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the [[Great Spirit]] where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus return order to the world ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&nbsp;15\u201316).\n\nThe [[Tlingit]] people of northern Canada say that the orcas were created when the hunter Natsihlane carved eight fish from yellow cedar, sang his most powerful spirit song and commanded the fish to leap into the water ([[#Reference-idHeimlichBoran2001|Heimlich & Boran 2001]], p.&nbsp;7).\n\nIn Icelandic legend a man threw a stone at a [[fin whale]] and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but in the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.<ref name=\"worldtrans\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrans.org/creators/whale/myths0.html|title=Whale Mythology from around the World|last=Anon|work=The Creative Continuum|publisher=worldtrans.org|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn East African legend, King Sulemani asked God that he might permit him to feed all the beings on earth. A whale came and ate until there was no corn left and then told Sulemani that he was still hungry and that there were 70,000 more in his tribe. Sulemani then prayed to God for forgiveness and thanked the creature for teaching him a lesson in humility ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&nbsp;15\u201316).\n\nSome cultures that associate [[divinity]] with whales, such as some Ghanaians and Vietnamese, coastal Chinese except for southernmost region,<ref>{{cite journal|authors=\u8b1d\u5a67, \u4e0b\u5712\u77e5\u5f25, \u5bae\u5d0e\u514b\u5247|year=2015|title=\u660e\u6e05\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u4e2d\u56fd\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u9be8\u8cc7\u6e90\u306e\u5229\u7528|url=http://www.seinan-gu.ac.jp/museum/wp-content/uploads/2015/publish/kiyou3.pdf|journal=\u897f\u5357\u5b66\u9662\u5927\u5b66\u535a\u7269\u9928\u7814\u7a76\u7d00\u8981 \u7b2c3\u53f7|pages=9\u201314|publisher=[[Seinan Gakuin University]]|format=pdf|accessdate=2016-01-15}}</ref> Japanese (also known as [[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]]),<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[\u6751\u4e0a\u5065\u53f8]]\u7de8\u8457|title=\u65e5\u672c\u5996\u602a\u5927\u4e8b\u5178|year=2005|publisher=[[\u89d2\u5ddd\u66f8\u5e97]]|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=182}}</ref><ref name=\"\u5927\u85e41955\">{{Cite book|author=\u5927\u85e4\u6642\u5f66\u4ed6|editor=\u6c11\u4fd7\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7de8|others=[[\u67f3\u7530\u570b\u7537]]\u76e3\u4fee|title=\u7d9c\u5408\u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u4fd7\u8a9e\u5f59|year=1955|publisher=[[\u5e73\u51e1\u793e]]|volume=\u7b2c2\u5dfb|pages=763}}</ref> occasionally hold funerals for beached whales; a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture.<ref>{{cite news|title=Whale funeral draws 1000 mourners in Vietnam|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/13/1050172476288.html|agency=AFP|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 April 2011|date=14 April 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Thousand gather for whale's funeral in Vietnam|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thousand-gather-for-whales-funeral-in-vietnam-1907716.html|agency=Associated Press|work=The Independent|accessdate=15 April 2011|location=London|date=23 February 2010}}</ref>([[#Reference-idViegas2010|Viegas 2010]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Funeral for a Whale held at Apam|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=87737|work=Ghana News Agency|publisher=GhanaWeb|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> See also the below-mentioned '''Ebisu''' in fish part for more details. In some lore, whales have been told to work for [[Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d]] as well.\n\nIndigenous [[Ainu people|Ainu]] tribes on Hokkaido refereed [[killer whale]]s as ''[[Repun Kamuy]]'', \"God of Sea/Offshore\" in their folklore and myths that the deities will bring fortunes (whales) to coastal people.\n\n{{Anchor|Whales in the Bible}}\nThe Bible mentions whales in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:21, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] 7:12, [[Ezekiel]] 32:2. The \"sea monsters\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some commentators to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \"jackals\" instead ([http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm Lamentations 4:3]).<!-- \"sea monsters\" (marine mammals) in the Douay-Rheims, KJV, Webster, AKJV, and English Jubilee 2000 version - KJV margin \"sea calves\" (seals) --> The story of [[Jonah#Jonah in Islam|Jonah]] being swallowed by a \"big Fish\" is told both in the Qur'an ({{Cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}) and in the Bible. The Old Testament contains the [[Book of Jonah]] and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:40 ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jonah+1-4 Jonah 1-4]).\n\n==Domesticated mammals==\n===Cattle and buffalo===\n\n{{Main|bull worship|Cattle in religion}}\n\nMany religions have considered [[cattle in religion|cattle]] to be sacred, most famously [[Hinduism]] from India and Nepal, but also [[Zoroastrianism]], and ancient [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religion. Cattle and buffalo are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nThe [[Toda (tribe)|Toda]] of southern [[India]] abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered.\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians worshipped a great number of deities who were either depicted entirely as cattle, or incorporated cattle features in their appearance. [[Hesat]], a goddess of milk and motherhood, was depicted as a full cow, as was [[Mehet-weret]], a sky goddess, identified as the Celestial Cow whose body made up the sky, and whose four legs marked the four cardinal directions. [[Bat (goddess)]], a goddess of music and dance, was depicted as a woman with bovine ears and horns, as was [[Hathor]], a very major goddess who borrowed a lot of her attributes from Bat. The great antiquity of the worship of Bat is evidenced by her appearance on the [[Narmer Palette]], made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs. When identified with the Celestial Cow Mehet-weret, the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] may also take the form of a cow, as in the [[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]. When acting in her role as a heavenly goddess, the mother goddess [[Isis]] may also be shown with bovine horns, adopting the traditional headdress of Hathor.\n\nAs well as these female cow goddesses, the Egyptians also had a number of male bull gods. Conspicuous among these was the bull god [[Apis (god)|Apis]], who was embodied in a living bull kept at the Temple of [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Regarded as [[Ptah]]'s herald, the Apis bull was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old bull died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months' education at [[Nilopolis]]. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After its death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. A similar practice was in place at [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] with the [[Mnevis]] bull, the herald of [[Ra]], and at [[Hermonthis]] with the [[Buchis]] bull, the herald of [[Montu]]. After their death, all these sacred bulls were considered to become part of [[Osiris]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nSimilar observances are found in our own day on the Upper [[Nile]]. The [[Nuba]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] revere cattle. The [[Angoni]] of Central Africa and the [[Sakalava]] of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In [[India]] respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nWhile there are several animals that are worshipped in India, the supreme position is held by the cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;63). The [[humped zebu]], a breed of cow, is central to the religion of Hinduism ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;63). Mythological legends have supported the sanctity of the zebu throughout India ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;64). Such myths have included the creation of a divine cow mother and a cow heaven by the God, [[Brahma]] and [[Prithu]], the sovereign of the universe, created the earth's vegetation, edible fruits and vegetables, disguised as a cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;64).\n\nAccording to Tadeusz Margul, observations of the Hindu religion and the cow has led to a misunderstanding that Hindi have a servile relationship with the zebu, giving prayers and offerings to it daily. Typically, however, only during the Cow Holiday, an annual event, is the cow the recipient of such practices ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;65). Margul suggests that sanctity of the cow is based on four foundations: abstaining from cow slaughter, abstaining from beef consumption, control of breeding and ownership, and belief in purification qualities of cow products (milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine) ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;65-66).\n\n===Sheep===\n{{Main|Sheep#In religion and folklore}}\nThe Ancient Egyptians worshipped \nseveral gods with the head of a ram, including [[Khnum]], [[Heryshaf]], [[Banebdjedet]], [[Ra]] (sometimes) and [[Kherty]].\n[[Amun]], the god of [[Thebes, Egypt]], was also associated with the ram, and in later periods was sometimes represented as ram-headed. His worshippers held the ram to be sacred, however, it was sacrificed once a year. Its fleece formed the clothing of the idol ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\n===Goat===\n{{Main|Goat#Religion, mythology, and folklore}}\n[[File:Mosaic Pan Genazzano Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|Pavement mosaic with the head of Pan. Roman artwork, Antonine period, 138\u2013192 CE.]]\n[[Silenus]], the [[Satyr]]s and the [[Faun]]s were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, [[Leszi]], is believed to have a goat's horns, ears and legs ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). A deity known as the Goat of [[Mendes]] is associated with the [[pentagram]].\n\nIn Greece, Italy, and Egypt, the goat was worshipped in both goat form and phallic form ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8). This type of worship has sometimes been said to have originated from the goat's increased sex drive. One male goat was capable of fertilizing 150 females ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8). The Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was depicted as having goat characteristics, such as hooves, horns, and a beard. Along with Pan, the goat was closely related to Dionysus during the Roman era ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8). To honor Dionysus, Romans would tear apart a goat and eat it alive.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The goat was commonly associated with dark arts and the devil. This association was amplified in Egypt during the Middle Ages ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8).{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nExcavations in Central Asia have revealed ancient ritual goat-burial that show a religious significance of the goat predominantly in the area ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&nbsp;286). These findings have been used as evidence for a goat-cult of Asia originating either in the Neolithic or Bronze Ages ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&nbsp;286).\n\n===Dog===\n[[Image:Dog worship in Hinduism.jpg|thumb|A dog after being decorated in the [[Kukur tihar]] festival in Nepal.]]\n{{Main|Dogs in religion}}\n\nDogs have a major religious significance among the [[Hindu]]s in [[Nepal]] and some parts of [[India]]. The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival that falls roughly in November every year. In [[Hinduism]], it is believed that the dog is a messenger of ''[[Yama]]'', the god of death, and dogs guard the doors of [[Heaven]]. Socially, they are believed to be the protectors of our homes and lives. So, in order to please the dogs they are going to meet at Heaven's doors after death, so they would be allowed in Heaven, people mark the 14th day of the [[lunar cycle]] in November as '''Kukur-tihar''', as known in Nepali language for the dog's day. This is a day when the dog is worshipped by applying ''[[Tilaka|tika]]'' (the holy vermilion dot), incense sticks and garlanded generally with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flower.\n\nActual dog worship is uncommon. The [[Nosarii]] of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The [[Karang Jiwo|Karang]] of Java had a cult of the red dog, each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In [[Nepal]] it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the [[Harranian]]s dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\n===Horse===\n[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|The Uffington White Horse]]\n{{Main|Horse worship}}\n\n[[Horse worship]] has been practiced by a number of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. There is some reason to believe that [[Poseidon]], like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a [[horse]]. In the cave of [[Phigalia]] [[Demeter]] was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized [[Vegetation deity|corn-spirit]] bore this form. Her priests were called [[Poloi]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"colts\") in [[Laconia]]. The mule and the horse are sacred to the Roman god [[Consus]]. In [[Gaul]] we find a horse-goddess, [[Epona]]. There are also traces of a horse-god, [[Rudiobus]]. [[Hayagriva]] is a horse-headed deity that appears in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Gonds]] in India worship a horse-god, [[Koda Pen]], in the form of a shapeless stone, but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or mare is a common form of the corn-spirit in Europe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nAmong the Balkan culture, swaddling an unmarried person in a horse-girth is a typical ritual. It is thought that the sexual potency of the horse is passed to the individual wrapped in its girth ([[#Reference-idVukanovi\u01071980|Vukanovi\u0107 1980]], p.&nbsp;112). Along with the Balkan swaddling, Virgil's Aeneid bases the founding of the great city of Carthage upon a horse ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&nbsp;32). When the Phoenicians dug up a horse head from the ground they decided to build their city (Carthage) upon that spot because the horse was a sign of success ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&nbsp;32). Thus, Brown argued that the horse was sacred to the Phoenician people ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Brown 1950]], p.&nbsp;32).\n\n===Elephant===\n{{main|Cultural depictions of elephants}}\n\n[[Image:13th century Ganesha statue.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A statue of [[Ganesha]] - the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and obstacle removal]]\nIn [[Thailand]] it is believed that a white [[elephant]] may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept ever afterwards. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and f\u00eated and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore f\u00eated by a whole village. In [[Cambodia]] it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. The cult of the white elephant is also found at [[Ennarea]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). In India, the popular Hindu god [[Ganesha]] has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human.\n\nIn [[Surat]], unmarried An\u0101vil girls participate in a holiday referred to as Alun\u0101m ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&nbsp;393). This holiday is to honor the goddess [[P\u0101rvat\u012b]]. During this celebration, a clay elephant is prepared (most likely to celebrate [[P\u0101rvat\u012b]]'s creation of [[Ganesha]] from a paste of either [[turmeric]] or [[sandalwood]]). Every day, the unmarried women worship this elephant by dancing, singing songs, and abstaining from eating salt. On the final day of Alun\u0101m, the clay elephant is immersed in some body of water ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&nbsp;393).\n\nCertain cultures also used elephant figurines to display the animal's importance. There was evidence of an ancient elephant cult in [[Sumatra]] ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&nbsp;41). Stone elephant figurines were built as \"seats of the souls\" in the Sumatran culture ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&nbsp;41). In [[North Borneo]], however, wooden elephant figurines were placed on the top of a bamboo pole. This bamboo pole was only erected after the tribe chief had collected a certain number of human heads ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&nbsp;41).\n\n==Wild mammals==\n\n===Hare===\nIn North America the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes had as their chief deity a \"mighty great [[hare]]\" to whom they went at death. According to one account he lived in the east, according to another in the north. In his anthropomorphized form he was known as [[Nanabozho|Menabosho]] or [[Michabo]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians also worshipped a hare goddess, named [[Wenut]]. She was associated with the city of [[Hermopolis]], and her image appears on the standard of the Hermopolitan nome.\n\n===Deer===\n[[Image:Diane de Versailles Leochares 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Artemis]] with a deer, the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'' in the Louvre ''Galerie des Caryatides'' that was designed for it]]\nThe [[Deer in mythology|deer]] is important in the mythology of many peoples. To the Greeks it was sacred to the goddess [[Artemis]], while in [[Hinduism]] it is linked to the goddess [[Saraswati]]. The deer also held spiritual significance to the pastoralist cultures of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. The golden stag figurine found in the [[Pazyryk burials]] is one of the most famous pieces of Scythian art.\n\n===Wolf===\n{{Main|Wolves in folklore, religion and mythology}}\n\nIn the story of [[Founding of Rome|Rome's foundation]], wolves are used in totemic imagery. The founding brothers [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]] are raised by a mother wolf, making the wolf the symbolic mother of Rome.\n\nAmong the Ancient Egyptians, the gods [[Anubis]] and [[Wepwawet]] both took the form a wolf, jackal or wild dog, or a man with the head of such a creature. Anubis was a funerary deity, considered the patron of the mummification process and a protector of tombs. In the afterlife, it was he who performed the crucial role in the Weighing of the Heart ceremony that decided the individual's post mortum fate. In earlier times Anubis was the supreme god of the underworld, but he was later replaced in that role by the human-formed [[Osiris]]. It is possible that the Egyptians originally conveived of Anubis as a wild dog because of the animals' location on the outskirts of towns, near the tombs of the dead, or possibly because of their scavengeing of corpses, which led them to congregate near tombs. Wepwawet was a deity more focussed on the world of the living, whose chief role was to 'open the way', whether this be opening the way of the pharaoh to victory in battle, opening the way for the priests in a ritual procession, or any other application. The great antiquity of Wepwawet's worship in Egypt is evidenced by the [[Narmer Palette]], made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs, including the image of a wolf on a standard as a part of a ritual procession. It has been suggested that Wepwawet's depiction as a wolf stems from the animal's keen sense of smell, allowing it to 'open the way' to find something important.\n\n=== Big cats ===\n[[File:Luxor Sekhmet New Kingdom.JPG|thumb|Granite statue of the lion-headed Egyptian deity [[Sekhmet]] from the [[Luxor Temple|temple of Mut at Luxor]], dating to 1403\u20131365 BC, exhibited in the [[National Museum of Denmark]]]]\n{{Anchor|Cats}}\n{{See also|Cultural depictions of lions|Cats in ancient Egypt}}\nThe cult of the [[leopard]] is widely found in West Africa. Among the [[Ashanti people]] a man who kills one is liable to be put to death; no leopard skin may be exposed to view, but a stuffed leopard is worshipped. On the Gold Coast a leopard hunter who has killed his victim is carried round the town behind the body of the leopard; he may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and imitate its movements. In [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] a prince's cap is put upon the head of a dead leopard, and dances are held in its honour ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nIn [[Ancient Egypt]], there were several feline-shaped deities. The earliest attested of these was the goddess [[Mafdet]]. During the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] 2920\u20132770 BC, Mafdet was regarded as the protector of the [[Pharaoh]]'s chambers against [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s and other evil. She was often depicted with the head of a leopard or lynx([[#Reference-idHornblower1943|Hornblower, 1943]]). In later periods, other feline deities were more dominant. There were several [[lion]]-headed deities, included goddesses such as [[Sekhmet]], [[Tefnut]], [[Bastet]] (early form), [[Pakhet]], [[Mehit]] and [[Menhit]], and gods such as [[Maahes]]. All of these were fierce deities, dedicated to destroying the enemies of the gods and the pharaoh. Sekhmet, the most famous Egyptian lion-goddess, was considered a daughter of the chief god [[Ra]] and was worshipped as a beneficent goddess who protected Egypt from pestilence and misfortune([[#Reference-idEngels2001|Engels, 2001]]), though at the same time was greatly feared due to her destructive capabilities, as demonstrated in the [[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]. [[Bastet]], formerly called Bast, was originally worshipped as a fierce lioness, though in later times was 'tamed' and worshipped as a gentler domestic cat. During the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] from 664 BC until the 4th century AD, the practice of mummifying [[Felis|small cat]]s in Bastet's honour grew in popularity. Cat mummies were used as [[votive offering]]s to the goddess, mostly during festivals and by [[pilgrim]]s ([[#Reference-idIkram2015|Ikram, 2015]]). Hundreds of thousands of cat mummies were excavated at cat cemeteries in [[Bubastis]], [[Saqqara]], [[Speos Artemidos]] and [[Gizeh]] ([[#Reference-idConway1891|Conway, 1891]]; [[#Reference-idHerdman1890|Herdman, 1890]]; [[#Reference-idZivie&Lichtenberg2005|Zivie & Lichtenberg, 2005]]).\n\nThere was a lion-god at [[Baalbek]]. The [[Arabic mythology|pre-Islamic Arabs]] worshipped the lion-god [[Yaghuth]]. In modern Africa we find a lion-idol among the [[Balonda]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52). The lion was also sacred to [[Hebat]], the [[mother goddess]] of the [[Hurrians]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn [[Judaism]] the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh \u05d2\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d4 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4, a \"Young Lion\" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. Thus the [[Lion of Judah]] started to be reverenced in some others abrahamic cults, symbolising their prophets, as such as [[Jesus]] and [[Haile Selassie I]], the ''ras'' Tafari.\n\nIn Mesoamerica [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|the jaguar was revered]] as a symbol of fertility and warriorship among the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Olmec]], and had an important role in shamanism.\n\n===Tiger===\n[[File:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Indian goddess [[Durga]] riding a tiger. Guler school, early 18th century.]]\n{{See also|Tiger#Cultural depictions}}\nOf great importance in Chinese myth and culture, the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] is one of the 12 [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]] animals. Also in various [[Chinese art]] and martial art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the [[Chinese dragon]]- the two representing matter and spirit respectively. The [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] ({{zh|c=\u767d\u864e|p=B\u00e1i H\u01d4}}) is one of the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellation]]s. It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (\u897f\u65b9\u767d\u864e), and it represents the [[west]] and the autumn season ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&nbsp;226\u201327).\n\nThe tiger replaces the lion as king of the beasts in cultures of eastern Asia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316 |title=Tiger Culture &#124; Save China's Tigers |publisher=English.savechinastigers.org |accessdate=2009-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212165117/http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316 |archivedate=12 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> representing royalty, fearlessness and wrath. In Chinese children stories, it is often depicted that the stripes on a tiger's forehead represent the character \u738b (\"king\") ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&nbsp;226\u201327).\n\nSome cultures that celebrated tiger worship are still represented contemporarily. In the suburbs of [[Kunming]], China, there is a tourist attraction where the tiger worship of the [[Yi people]] is displayed for visitors. This attraction called the Solar Calendar Square is complete with a growling tiger statue, measuring to be five meters high ([[#Reference-idHarrell&Yongxiang2003|Harrell & Yongxiang 2003]], p.&nbsp;380). In Chuxiong of China, a similar attraction exists. A tiger totem is presented for tourists; the totem portrays the Yi belief of the tiger setting the entire world in motion. A tiger dance of the Shuangbai County is also performed at such places explaining the history of the Yi and their worship of tigers ([[#Reference-idHarrell&Yongxiang2003|Harrell & Yongxiang 2003]], p.&nbsp;380).\n\nAlong with these tourist attractions that display historical practices of the Yi, there is also additional evidence for tiger worship. Tigers were found depicted on small stones. These stones were pierced and worn as amulets, suggesting that the tiger had a certain power of protection for its wearer ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;76). The Queen Mother deity of the west, [[Queen Mother of the West|Hsi Wang Mu]], sometimes possessed a tail of a tiger in her depictions and, like the tiger, was associated with the mountains ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;76). The tiger was also a deity for both the Tungus and the Black Pottery people ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;80).\n\nIn Korean history and culture, a tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirit and a sacred creature that brings good luck \u2013 the symbol of courage and absolute power. It appears in not only the [[Korean foundation mythology]] but also in [[Korean folklore|folklore]], as well as a favorite subject of [[Korean art]] such as [[Korean painting|painting]] and sculpture. For example, the 19th-century painting named \u201cSansindo\u201d (\uc0b0\uc2e0\ub3c4) depicts the guardian spirit of a mountain leaning against a tiger or riding on the back of the animal. The animal is also known to do the errands for the mountain's guardian spirit which is known to wish for peace and the well-being of the village. So, the tiger was ordered by the spiritual guardian of the mountain to give protection and wish for peace in the village. People drew such paintings and hung them in the shrine built in the mountain of the village where memorial rituals were performed regularly. In Buddhism, there is also a shrine that keeps the painting of the guardian spirit of the mountain. Called \u201cSansintaenghwa\u201d, it is depiction of the guardian spirit of the mountain and a tiger.<ref>[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]</ref>\n\nIn many parts of Vietnam, the [[tiger]] is a revered creature. In each village, there might be a tiger temple. This worshiping practice might have stem from the fear of tigers used to raid human settlements in the ancient time. Tigers are admired for their great strength, ferocity and grace. Tiger is also considered a guardian deity. Tiger statutes are usually seen at the entrance of temples and palaces, keeping evil spirits from entering those places.\n\nThe tiger is associated with the [[Hindu]] deities [[Shiva]] and [[Durga]]. In [[Pokhara]], Nepal the tiger festival is known as [[Bagh Jatra]]. Celebrants dance disguised as tigers and \"hunted\". The [[Warli]] tribe of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] worship Waghia the lord of tigers in the form of a shapeless stone ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52). In [[Vietnamese folk religion]] and [[Dongbei folk religion]] tiger-gods are also found.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Monkey===\n[[File:Hear speak see no evil Toshogu.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[three wise monkeys]] over the [[Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b|T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b]] shrine in [[Nikk\u014d]], [[Japan]]]]\n{{Main|Monkey}}\nIn Hinduism the monkey deity, [[Hanuman]], is a prominent figure. He is a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction. In orthodox villages monkeys are safe from harm ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\n[[Chinese religions]] and [[Chinese mythology|mythologies]] give monkeys and apes [[Monkeys in Chinese culture#Religious significance|cultural significance]] as metaphors for people. Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys, for example, [[Sun Wukong]] or \"Monkey King\" is the main protagonist in [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s picaresque novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. In traditional [[Chinese folk religion]], monkeys are supernatural beings that could [[shape shift]] into either monkey-demons or were-monkeys, and legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common. In [[Daoism]], monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed to have longevity like a ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' \"transcendent; immortal\", and to be innately adept at circulating and absorbing ''[[qi]]'' \"breath; life force\" through the Daoist discipline of ''[[daoyin]]'' \"guiding and pulling\". Similar to Daoism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] paradoxically treats monkeys as both wise and foolish animals. On the one hand, the ''[[Jataka tales]]'' say that [[Gautama Buddha]] was a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation; and on the other hand, monkeys symbolized trickery and ignorance, represented by the [[Chan Buddhist]] \"[[mind monkey]]\" metaphor for the unsettled, restless nature of human mentality.\n\nMonkeys are said to be worshipped in [[Togo]]. At [[Porto Novo]], in French West Africa, twins have tutelary spirits in the shape of small monkeys ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nThe hamadryas baboon was sacred to the Ancient Egyptians, and often appeared as a form of a deity. Egyptian deities depicted as baboons include [[Hapi (Son of Horus)]], [[Babi (mythology)]] and [[Thoth]], although the latter is more often shown with the head of an ibis. A group of 6 or 8 baboons were also a common feature in scenes showing the sun god at dawn as he rose over the horizon, with the baboons raising their hands to him in praise. This is probably inspired by the observed behaviour of baboons, as they are known to 'chatter' at sunrise, as if greeting the sun.\n\n===Rodent===\nIn some countries, e.g. India, a small number of temples are dedicated to the worship of wild mice. Whilst widely regarded as a creature to be avoided, for pestilential reasons in such temples the animals are actively encouraged. It is frequently associated with Ganesh. As a creature capable of survival, it is to be revered and respected.\n\n==Birds==\n===Crow/raven===\n{{Main|Raven in mythology}}\n\nThe [[Raven]] is the chief deity of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people of [[Alaska]]. All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a culture hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). A raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the \"Raven\" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.\n\nIn the creator role, and in the Raven's role as the [[totem]] and [[Apical ancestor|ancestor]] of one of the four northwest clan houses, the Raven is often addressed as ''Grandfather Raven''. It is not clear whether this form of address is intended to refer to a [[Creator deity|creator]] Raven who is different from the [[trickster]] Raven, or if it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably.\n\nTogether with the eagle-hawk the crow plays a great part in the mythology of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). Ravens also play a part in some European mythologies, such as in the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Religions]], where they were connected to [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]] and the [[Morrigan]] in the former and [[Woden]] in the latter.\n\n===Hawk===\nNorth Borneo treated the [[hawk]] as a god, but it was technically the messenger of the people's Supreme God ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). There were rituals that involved the hawk when the natives wished to make decisions about certain events, such as journeys from home, major agricultural work, and war ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). In North [[Borneo]] we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the [[Kenyahs]], the [[Kayans]] and the sea [[Dyaks]]. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk-god, [[Laki Neho]], but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, [[Laki Tenangan]]. [[Singalang Burong]], the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger. For he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nAccording to Florance Waterbury, hawk worship was universal ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;26). This particular bird was \"a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes\" ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;26).\n\nThe hawk is commonly associated with the Egyptian god [[Horus]]. As a god of the sky, divine authority, war, victory and civilisation, Horus became the patron deity of the pharaohs. The souls of former pharaohs were said to be the followers of Horus and therefore, the hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;26). Horus was originally depicted by the Egyptians as a full hawk, but after the Fourth and Fifth Dynasty depictions with a human body and a hawk head became more common. ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;27). Other Egyptian deities shown in the form of a hawk or hawk-headed man include [[Qebehsenuef]], [[Sopdu]], [[Ra]] (not always) and [[Seker|Sokar]].\n\nEgypt was not the only location of hawk worshippers. There were several other cultures which held the hawk in high regard. The hawk was a deity on the island of Hawaii and symbolized swift justice ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). Along with the lone island from the Hawaiian archipelago, the Fiji islands also had some tribes who worshipped a hawk god ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). Furthermore, although animal worshipping is not a part of Sikh culture, a white falcon bird is mostly regarded in Sikhism as it was associated with the sixth guru and especially the tenth guru. The tenth guru would always carry a white falcon perched on his hand when going out to hunt. The tenth guru was known as the Master of White Hawk. Many people believe that the bird carried by Guru Gobind Singh was a hawk, however historians believe that the bird was a gyrfalcon or a saker falcon.\n\n===Frigatebird===\nOn [[Easter Island]] until the 1860s there was a [[Tangata manu]] (Bird man) cult which has left us Paintings and [[Petroglyphs]] of Birdmen (half men half [[frigatebird]]s). The cult involved an annual race to collect the first [[sooty tern]] egg of the season from the islet of [[Motu Iti (Rapa Nui)|Moto Iti]] and take it to [[Orongo]].\n\nThe Frigate Bird Cult is thought to have originated in the Solomon Islands before immigrating to Easter Island where it became obsolete ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&nbsp;374). The Frigate-Bird was a representation of the god [[Makemake (mythology)|Make-make]], the god of the seabird's egg on Easter Island ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&nbsp;374).\n\n===Ibis===\nIn Ancient Egypt, the ibis was considered sacred as it was viewed as a manifestation of [[Thoth]], a god of the moon and wisdom. In art, Thoth was usually depicted as a man with the head of an ibis, or more rarely as a baboon. Sacred ibises were kept and fed in temples in his honour, and mummified ibises were given to him as votive offerings. It is thought that the association of the ibis with Thoth may have originated from the curved shape of the bird's beak, which resembles a crescent moon.\n\n==Other non-mammals==\n===Serpent===\n{{Main|Snake worship }}\n[[Image:Naga3.jpg|thumb| right|The altar where serpent deities are worshipped in a temple in [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Karnataka]], India]]\n[[Image:Quetzalcoatl telleriano.jpg|thumb|right|Quetzalcoatl depicted as a snake devouring a man, from the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]].]]\nThe worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the [[Old World]], and in the Americas ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nIn India [[snake worship]] refers to the high status of [[snake]]s in [[Hindu mythology]]. Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras ([[Naga (mythology)|nagas]]) or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nAt one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Nagaraja and known as the \"king of the serpents\" was worshipped. Instead of the \"king of the serpents,\" actual live snakes were worshipped in South India ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&nbsp;1). The Manasa-cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, [[Manasa]] ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&nbsp;1).\n\nIn Africa the chief centre of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] worship was [[Dahomey]]. but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the ''danh-gbi'' kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. ''Danh-gbi'' has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the [[Betsileo]] of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]], on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nIn Ancient Egyptian religion, serpents had both positive and negative representations. On the one hand, the Egyptians worshipped a number of beneficent snake deities, including [[Wadjet]], [[Renenutet]], [[Meretseger]], [[Nehebkau]] and [[Mehen]]. The [[uraeus]] was a fierce divine cobra that protected Egyptian kings and major deities. On the other hand, the serpent [[Apep|Apophis]] was a malevolent demon, who endeavoured to destroy the chief deity [[Ra]].\n\nThe Sumerians had a serpent god [[Ningizzida]].\n\n===Fish===\n{{Main|Fish in culture}}\n\n[[Image:Dagon1.jpg|thumb|A modern interpretation of Dagon as a \"fish-god\"]]\nAccording to the [[Jewish]] scholar [[Rashi]], the [[Canaan]]ite god [[Dagon]] was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered [[relief]]s suggest a fish-god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nIn Japan, there was a deity called Ebisu-gami who, according to Sakurada Katsunori, was widely revered by fishing communities and industries ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;1). Ebisu, in later traditions, normally appeared in the form of a fisherman holding a fishing pole and carrying a red tai (a perch), but would sometimes take the form of a whale, shark, human corpse, or rock ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;1). The general image of Ebisu, however, appears to be the whale or the shark, according to Sakurada ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;2).\n\nDuring Ebisu-gami festivals, there have been legends told of strange fish creatures which have arrived and been considered sacred. Examples of such fish creatures include familiar species of fish with multiple tails ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;2). Sometimes these fish were considered to be simply an offering to the deity. Other times, however, they were considered to be Ebisu himself, visiting on the festival day ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;2). Large marine [[megafauna]]s such as whales and [[whale shark]]s (also called as \"Ebisu-shark\") were often referred as Ebisu himself to bring mass of fish among them, and as guardians of fishermen.<ref name=\"\u5927\u85e41955\" />\n\nThe Ancient Egyptian goddess [[Hatmehit]] from the city of [[Mendes]] was depicted as a fish, fish-woman hybrid, or a woman with a fish emblem or crown on her head. She was a goddess of life and protection. Fish, specifically Nile perch, were also held sacred to the Egyptian goddess [[Neith]] at her temple at [[Esna]].{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n===Amphibians===\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians worshipped a goddess in the form of a frog, named [[Heqet]]. She was a goddess of fertility, both the fertility of the land and the fertility of human reproduction. She was particularly associated with the final stages of the Nile flood, as well as the final stages of human birth. She was portrayed as a divine midwife, and was considered the consort of the god [[Khnum]] due to their similar roles.\n\n===Insects===\n\nThe dung beetle, or scarab, was an important symbol in Ancient Egyptian religion. The behaviour of the beetle rolling its ball of dung along the ground was likened to the sun god rolling the sun across the sky. As a result, the beetle god [[Khepri]] received worship in the city of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], the main sanctuary of the sun god [[Ra]]. In addition, the birth of young beetles from eggs laid in dung was an important symbol of rebirth, so amulets in the shape of scarabs were often included in tombs.\n\nAnother insect venerated by the Egyptians was the scorpion. The goddess [[Serqet]] was depicted wearing a scorpion on her headdress, and was prayed to in order to heal venomous stings and bites. She was one of a group of four goddesses frequently invoked together to protect the body in funerary customs, the others being [[Isis]], [[Nephthys]] and [[Neith]]. The four were often charged with protecting particular organs, assisting the [[Four Sons of Horus]]. Though less famous than the other three canopic goddesses, Serqet's worship is clearly very ancient, with images of scorpions appearing very early in Egyptian art, and even appearing in the names of several early kings. Though the association of Serqet with the scorpion has long been assumed her original function, recent scholarship has questioned whether the original animal in her headdress may have actually been a waterscorpion, and the association with the land scorpion came later.\n\n==Oracular animals==\nAnimals are frequently used for the purposes of [[divination]].\n[[Bird]]s are especially common in this role, as by their faculty of flight they offer themselves to the interpretation as messengers between the celestial and human spheres. [[Augury]] was a highly developed practice of telling the future from the flight of birds in [[Classical Antiquity]]. The [[dove]] appears as an oracular animal in the story of [[Noah]], and also in [[Thisbe]] in [[Boeotia]] there was a dove-oracle of [[Zeus]]. Animal imagery was also often employed in the [[oracle|oracular utterances]] in Ancient Greece ([[#Reference-idLightfoot2008|Lightfoot 2008]], p.&nbsp;237,&nbsp;fn.&nbsp;105). [[Parrot astrology]] is a form of divination using [[green parakeet]]s which originated in South India and is still practised in modern times ([[#Reference-idNaidu_Ratnala2005|Naidu Ratnala 2005]]).\nIn [[Chinese traditional religion]], the [[tortoise]] is an oracular animal.\n\nA popular North American tradition is [[Groundhog Day]], in which on February 2 each year a groundhog is used to predict whether there will be an early spring.\n\nNotable oracular animals of the modern period include [[Lady Wonder]], [[Punxsutawney Phil]], [[Maggie the Monkey]], [[Lazdeika the Crab]], [[Paul the Octopus]], and [[Sonny Wool]].\n\n==Shamanism and animals==\n{{Main|Shamanism}}\nAnimals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as \"assistant spirits,\" \"guardian spirits,\" and \"helping spirits,\" animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman's work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;228-229). When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman's efforts ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;231).\n\nAn example of animal spirits in Shamanism comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks culture. During a healing procedure, a shaman invokes a number of animal spirits to help him. The spirits arrive and enter his body. The shaman is not possessed by these spirits; he is free to expel them at any time ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;223). His body begins to leap all over the place, symbolizing that his soul is rising, leaving the earth and going up to the sky. It is a bird spirit that is lifting him through the atmosphere and he cries for it to take him higher so he can see further. According to Adolf Friedrich, at this point the shaman's essence has, in fact, transformed into the bird spirit that crossed the threshold into his body ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;223). He finally spots what he is looking for, the soul of his ill patient. Still assisting him, the animal spirits carry the shaman to the patient's soul. The shaman retrieves it and returns the soul to its rightful place, healing the patient. Without the presence of animal spirits, the shaman could not have accomplished such a feat ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;231).\n\nIn the Inner Eurasian religion, the transformation of a shaman's essence into an animal spirit is referred to as \"becoming animal\" ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). The importance of animals in this shamanic religion is shown by the capabilities that animals grant to human beings. Without the assistance of animals, humans from Inner Eurasia were not capable of reaching the sky, traveling rapidly throughout the earth, or going beneath the earth's outer crust, all of which were important activities to the culture ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). Heaven was not attainable for a person without the assistance of an eagle. Because of the eagle, an animal, the Inner Eurasians believed that they were capable of achieving their after-life and living in the home of their ancestors and Supreme God after their departure from the earth ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). Heaven was represented by the people in assemblies of animals, usually grouped in sevens or nines ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). When participating in hunting or warfare, Inner Eurasians also took on animal qualities because they believed it would increase their success ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). Animals were a central part of this religion ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167).\n\n==Religion and animals==\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}\n{{see also|Life release|Buddhist vegetarianism}}\n\nOne of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;234). According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. Thus, the world is not specifically meant for human use and should be shared equally amongst all creatures ([[#Reference-idEpstein1990|Epstein 1990]]). Buddhists recognize that all animals are sentient and are capable of feeling pain, grief, fear, happiness, and hunger ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], pp.&nbsp;234\u2013235). The [[Dalai Lama]] once said \"Even ants and other insects will run away from danger... They have intelligence and want to live too. Why should we harm them?\" ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Qtd. in Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;235). Not believing in inflicting harm on any living, sentient being, some Buddhists also follow a [[vegetarian]] diet to avoid causing pain to animals ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;238).\n\nAvoiding the destruction of life can affect aspects beyond a Buddhist's diet, such as travel plans. In order to avoid crushing any living thing, be it plant, insect, or animal, some Buddhist [[monk]]s do not travel during rainy seasons ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;236). Originally, shortly after Buddhism was first founded, monks traveled during all seasons, but public opinion changed this. The people protested that so much life was crushed and destroyed when monks traveled during the wet season. As a result, monks were required to seek shelter during this season and abstain from journeys ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]], p.&nbsp;22).\n\nLiving creatures, including humans, culminate to form one large, united life-force in the Buddhist religion. Buddhists, therefore, believe that to harm another living creature is to, in fact, harm yourself as all life-forms are interrelated ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;237). There are many tales that depict humans sacrificing their lives so that an animal may live. A [[jataka]], or previous incarnation story, tells how the Buddha, (upon hearing the distraught cries of a lioness struggling to feed her hungry cubs), leapt from a cliff and smashed his body to death as an offering, so that she could feed his flesh to them ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]]).\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{main|Cow protection movement|Cattle slaughter in India|Elephants in Kerala culture|Lion Capital of Ashoka}}\n{{see also|Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Ashvamedha}}\n\n[[Hinduism]] is one of the six primary [[Religions in India|religions]] of [[India]] ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;221). Hinduism has evolved over several centuries from [[Vedas|Vedic]] times when there was no restriction on animal worship and also animal consumption for food, to later [[Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]]-influenced [[eras]] that led to a wider concept adoption of [[non-violence]] or [[ahimsa]] and respect for animals, as a major constituent in [[Dharmic]] belief systems ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;223). Humans and animals are believed to be one family and therefore, humans should treat all living creatures with respect and kindness. It is also believed that human beings themselves [[Re-incarnation|re-incarnate]] as animals based on their deeds or [[karma]]. Pets are often treated as if they are truly members of the family ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;223-224).\n\nThere are some exceptions to ahimsa in Hinduism - mainly dealing with religious rituals to please gods on [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism#Animal sacrifice in contemporary Hindu society|special occasions]] and for daily sustenance. While Hindu belief proscribes the slaughter for human pleasure or lavishness {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, animal sacrifice has been an accepted ritual in ''some'' parts of India ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;225).An example of such lavishness would be hunting for pleasure, a fur coat made from animal skin, etc. An explanation for this supposed paradox is that a sacrificial animal is not really considered to be an animal, but a symbol. Thus, when the animal is sacrificed, they are sacrificing the symbol and not the animal ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;226).\n\n===Jainism===\n{{main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}\n{{see also|Jain vegetarianism}}\n\n[[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Teerthankar]] of [[Jainism]], believed that the only way to be released from the cycle of life (birth, death, and then rebirth), one must follow ahimsa and not harm any living creature ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;229). Some Jains will carry a broom with them and sweep their path as they walk to avoid stepping on any living creature. Jains will also wear masks over their mouths to prevent swallowing insects and inspect their fruit for worms. The fruit inspection is not, however, because of their aversion of worms, but for the protection of the worms themselves ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;229-230). Jains are also only allowed to eat during daylight hours, when their vision is not restricted, so that they avoid eating insects or other small creatures that could possibly be in their food ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;230).\n\nJainism includes a lay form which is somewhat less restrictive ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;231). Basically lay Jains must distinguish between what forms of violence are necessary and unnecessary, but do not have to abstain entirely ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&nbsp;5). This results in avoiding all forms of hunting, tilling the soil (tilling involved disturbing creatures embedded in the earth), and brewing (brewing involved using living organisms such as yeasts) ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;231).\n\nFood will never be prepared especially for them. They beg for food from others believing that because the food was prepared for someone else, they are not the cause of violence towards living creatures ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&nbsp;5).\n\nLay Jains, who have the financial capacity, will visit animal markets and buy/rescue animals destined for slaughter for the good that it does. ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;232).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Animals}}\n* [[Animal welfare]]\n* [[Animal-assisted therapy]]\n* [[Animism]]\n* [[Anthrozoology]]\n* [[Moral status of animals in the ancient world]]\n* [[Nature worship]]\n* [[Totemism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|id=idBaldick2000|reference=Baldick, Julian (2000). \"Animal and Shaman: Ancient Religions of Central Asia\" New York University Press, New York}}\n* {{wikicite|id=idBalfour1917|reference=Balfour, Henry (1917). \"Some Ethnological Suggestions in Regard to Easter Island, or Rapanui\" Folklore, '''28'''(4). }}\n* {{wikicite|id=idBhattacharyya1965|reference=Bhattacharyya, Asutosh (1965). \"The Serpent as a Folk-Deity in Bengal\" Asian Folklore Studies, '''24'''(1). }}\n* {{wikicite|id=idBird2007|reference=[[Jonathan Bird|Bird, Jonathan]] (2007). \"[http://www.oceanicresearch.org/education/wonders/spermwhales.htm Sperm Wales: The deep rivers of the ocean]\".

When a god is respected or worshipped by means of a representative animal, an animal cult is formed ([[#Reference-idTeeter2002|Teeter et al., 2002]], p.&nbsp;355). Animal cults may be classified according to their outward form or according to their inward meaning, which may of course undergo transformations ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nThe classical author Diodorus explained the origin of animal worship by recalling the myth in which the gods, supposedly threatened by giants, hid under the guise of animals. The people then naturally began to worship the animals that their gods had disguised themselves as and continued this act even after the gods returned to their normal state ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&nbsp;252). In 1906, Weissenborn suggested that animal worship resulted from man's natural curiosity. Primitive man would observe an animal that had a unique trait and the inexplicability of this trait would appeal to man's curiosity ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&nbsp;282). Wonder resulted from primitive man's observations of this distinctive trait and this wonder eventually induced adoration. Thus, primitive man worshipped animals that had inimitable traits ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&nbsp;282). Lubbock put forward a more recent view. Lubbock proposed that animal-worship originated from family names. In societies, families would name themselves and their children after certain animals and eventually came to hold that animal above other animals. Eventually, these opinions turned into deep respect and evolved into fully developed worship of the family animal ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&nbsp;253). The belief that an animal is sacred frequently results in [[Taboo food and drink|dietary laws]] prohibiting their consumption. As well as holding certain animals to be sacred, religions have also adopted the opposite attitude, that certain animals are [[unclean animals|unclean]].\n\nThe idea that divinity embodies itself in animals, such as a deity incarnate, and then lives on earth among human beings is disregarded by [[Abrahamic]] religions ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&nbsp;26). In [[Independent Assemblies of God]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, animals have very little religious significance ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Schoffeleers, 1985; Peltzer, 1987; Qtd. in Morris, 2000]], p.&nbsp;25). Animals have become less and less important and symbolic in cult rituals and religion, especially among African cultures, as Christianity and Islamic religions have spread. ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&nbsp;24).\n\nThe [[Egyptian pantheon]] was especially fond of [[zoomorphism]], with many animals sacred to particular deities\u2014[[cat]]s to [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]], [[ibis]]es and [[baboon]]s to [[Thoth]], [[crocodile]]s to [[Sobek]] and [[Ra]], fish to [[Set (mythology)|Set]], [[mongoose]], [[shrew]] and [[bird]]s to [[Horus]], dogs and [[jackal]]s to [[Anubis]], serpents and [[eel]]s to [[Atum]], [[beetle]]s to [[Khepera]], bulls to [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]]. Animals were often [[Animal Mummies|mummified]] as a result of these beliefs.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Hunting cults==\n===Bear===\n{{Main|Bear worship}}\nThere is evidence that connects the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as \"bears\" in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a [[nymph]] into a bear and then into the constellation [[Ursa Major]].\n\nThe existence of an ancient bear cult among Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic period has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&nbsp;434-435). Ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and their peculiar arrangement are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic era. ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&nbsp;435).\n\n[[Image:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[Iomante]]'' ceremony (bear sending). Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870.]]\nThe [[Ainu people]], who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear \"[[kamui]]\" in [[Ainu language|their language]], which translates to mean god. While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&nbsp;345). For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term \"kamui\" is used, it essentially means a bear ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&nbsp;345). The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&nbsp;348).\n\n===Whale===\n[[Image:B\u1ed9 c\u1ed1t c\u00e1 voi.jpg|right|thumb|The largest whale skeleton in Vietnam at [[:vi:V\u1ea1n Th\u1ee7y T\u00fa|V\u1ea1n Th\u1ee7y T\u00fa temple]], one of [[:vi:T\u1ee5c th\u1edd c\u00e1 \u00d4ng|Vietnamese Whale worship]] in [[Vietnamese folk religion]]s]]\n\nWhales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe ([[#Reference-idBird2007|Bird 2007]]). Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies.\n\nA prevalent [[whale]] cult in Japan occurs around the coastal area. There are cemeteries with memorial stones dedicated to the whales which were hunted and killed to feed the people ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;4).\nBuddhist epitaphs mark these stones which implore that Buddha be reborn as a whale ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;4). Along with these memorials, there is evidence that whale embryos, found in a deceased mother's womb, were extracted and buried with the same respect as a human being ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;5). For certain shrines, the bones of a perished whale were also deposited in the area ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;5).\n\nIn Alaska, there are cultures that have ceremonial tributes whales after they are captured in a hunt ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&nbsp;445). Some tribes bring the hump, the fins, or the nose of the whale into their camps or the whaler's house. These parts are meant to represent the entirety of the whale and are honored as such during the festival ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&nbsp;445). The bones of a whale are also given ritual treatment. The Alaskan tribes that participate in such acts believe that their ceremonies protect the whale's soul from injury and the soul can then be free to return to the sea ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&nbsp;445).\n\nIn China, ''Yu-kiang'', a whale with the hands and feet of a man was said to rule the ocean ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&nbsp;15\u201316).\n\nIn the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region of Austria, it was said that if a sunbeam were to fall on a maiden entering womanhood, she would be carried away in the belly of a whale ([[#Reference-idFrazer1913|Frazer 1913]], p.&nbsp;72).\n\n[[Paikea]] (also maori name for [[humpback whale]]s<ref name=Teara>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/14178|title=Te wh\u0101nau puha \u2013 whales \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=Teara.govt.nz|accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref>), the youngest and favourite son of the chief Uenuku from the island of [[Mangaia]], in the present day [[Cook Islands]], was said by the Kati Kuri people of [[Kaikoura]] to have come from the Pacific Islands on the back of ''Tohora'' (maori name for [[southern right whale]]s<ref name=Teara />) a whale many centuries before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/whales/EducationResource.aspx?irn=198|title=Whales|last=Anon|work=Tinirau education resource|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe whale features in [[Inuit]] [[creation myth]]s. When 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the [[Great Spirit]] where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus return order to the world ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&nbsp;15\u201316).\n\nThe [[Tlingit]] people of northern Canada say that the orcas were created when the hunter Natsihlane carved eight fish from yellow cedar, sang his most powerful spirit song and commanded the fish to leap into the water ([[#Reference-idHeimlichBoran2001|Heimlich & Boran 2001]], p.&nbsp;7).\n\nIn Icelandic legend a man threw a stone at a [[fin whale]] and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst.

A whale came and ate until there was no corn left and then told Sulemani that he was still hungry and that there were 70,000 more in his tribe. Sulemani then prayed to God for forgiveness and thanked the creature for teaching him a lesson in humility ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&nbsp;15\u201316).\n\nSome cultures that associate [[divinity]] with whales, such as some Ghanaians and Vietnamese, coastal Chinese except for southernmost region,<ref>{{cite journal|authors=\u8b1d\u5a67, \u4e0b\u5712\u77e5\u5f25, \u5bae\u5d0e\u514b\u5247|year=2015|title=\u660e\u6e05\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u4e2d\u56fd\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u9be8\u8cc7\u6e90\u306e\u5229\u7528|url=http://www.seinan-gu.ac.jp/museum/wp-content/uploads/2015/publish/kiyou3.pdf|journal=\u897f\u5357\u5b66\u9662\u5927\u5b66\u535a\u7269\u9928\u7814\u7a76\u7d00\u8981 \u7b2c3\u53f7|pages=9\u201314|publisher=[[Seinan Gakuin University]]|format=pdf|accessdate=2016-01-15}}</ref> Japanese (also known as [[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]]),<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[\u6751\u4e0a\u5065\u53f8]]\u7de8\u8457|title=\u65e5\u672c\u5996\u602a\u5927\u4e8b\u5178|year=2005|publisher=[[\u89d2\u5ddd\u66f8\u5e97]]|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=182}}</ref><ref name=\"\u5927\u85e41955\">{{Cite book|author=\u5927\u85e4\u6642\u5f66\u4ed6|editor=\u6c11\u4fd7\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7de8|others=[[\u67f3\u7530\u570b\u7537]]\u76e3\u4fee|title=\u7d9c\u5408\u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u4fd7\u8a9e\u5f59|year=1955|publisher=[[\u5e73\u51e1\u793e]]|volume=\u7b2c2\u5dfb|pages=763}}</ref> occasionally hold funerals for beached whales; a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture.<ref>{{cite news|title=Whale funeral draws 1000 mourners in Vietnam|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/13/1050172476288.html|agency=AFP|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 April 2011|date=14 April 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Thousand gather for whale's funeral in Vietnam|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thousand-gather-for-whales-funeral-in-vietnam-1907716.html|agency=Associated Press|work=The Independent|accessdate=15 April 2011|location=London|date=23 February 2010}}</ref>([[#Reference-idViegas2010|Viegas 2010]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Funeral for a Whale held at Apam|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=87737|work=Ghana News Agency|publisher=GhanaWeb|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> See also the below-mentioned '''Ebisu''' in fish part for more details. In some lore, whales have been told to work for [[Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d]] as well.\n\nIndigenous [[Ainu people|Ainu]] tribes on Hokkaido refereed [[killer whale]]s as ''[[Repun Kamuy]]'', \"God of Sea/Offshore\" in their folklore and myths that the deities will bring fortunes (whales) to coastal people.\n\n{{Anchor|Whales in the Bible}}\nThe Bible mentions whales in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:21, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] 7:12, [[Ezekiel]] 32:2. The \"sea monsters\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some commentators to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \"jackals\" instead ([http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm Lamentations 4:3]).<!-- \"sea monsters\" (marine mammals) in the Douay-Rheims, KJV, Webster, AKJV, and English Jubilee 2000 version - KJV margin \"sea calves\" (seals) --> The story of [[Jonah#Jonah in Islam|Jonah]] being swallowed by a \"big Fish\" is told both in the Qur'an ({{Cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}) and in the Bible. The Old Testament contains the [[Book of Jonah]] and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:40 ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jonah+1-4 Jonah 1-4]).\n\n==Domesticated mammals==\n===Cattle and buffalo===\n\n{{Main|bull worship|Cattle in religion}}\n\nMany religions have considered [[cattle in religion|cattle]] to be sacred, most famously [[Hinduism]] from India and Nepal, but also [[Zoroastrianism]], and ancient [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religion. Cattle and buffalo are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nThe [[Toda (tribe)|Toda]] of southern [[India]] abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered.\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians worshipped a great number of deities who were either depicted entirely as cattle, or incorporated cattle features in their appearance. [[Hesat]], a goddess of milk and motherhood, was depicted as a full cow, as was [[Mehet-weret]], a sky goddess, identified as the Celestial Cow whose body made up the sky, and whose four legs marked the four cardinal directions. [[Bat (goddess)]], a goddess of music and dance, was depicted as a woman with bovine ears and horns, as was [[Hathor]], a very major goddess who borrowed a lot of her attributes from Bat. The great antiquity of the worship of Bat is evidenced by her appearance on the [[Narmer Palette]], made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs. When identified with the Celestial Cow Mehet-weret, the sky goddess [[Nut]] may also take the form of a cow, as in the [[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]. When acting in her role as a heavenly goddess, the mother goddess [[Isis]] may also be shown with bovine horns, adopting the traditional headdress of Hathor.\n\nAs well as these female cow goddesses, the Egyptians also had a number of male bull gods. Conspicuous among these was the bull god [[Apis (god)|Apis]], who was embodied in a living bull kept at the Temple of [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis]]. Regarded as [[Ptah]]'s herald, the Apis bull was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old bull died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months' education at [[Nilopolis]]. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After its death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. A similar practice was in place at [[Heliopolis]] with the [[Mnevis]] bull, the herald of [[Ra]], and at [[Hermonthis]] with the [[Buchis]] bull, the herald of [[Montu]]. After their death, all these sacred bulls were considered to become part of [[Osiris]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nSimilar observances are found in our own day on the Upper [[Nile]]. The [[Nuba]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] revere cattle. The [[Angoni]] of Central Africa and the [[Sakalava]] of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In [[India]] respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nWhile there are several animals that are worshipped in India, the supreme position is held by the cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;63). The [[humped zebu]], a breed of cow, is central to the religion of Hinduism ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;63). Mythological legends have supported the sanctity of the zebu throughout India ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;64). Such myths have included the creation of a divine cow mother and a cow heaven by the God, [[Brahma]] and [[Prithu]], the sovereign of the universe, created the earth's vegetation, edible fruits and vegetables, disguised as a cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;64).\n\nAccording to Tadeusz Margul, observations of the Hindu religion and the cow has led to a misunderstanding that Hindi have a servile relationship with the zebu, giving prayers and offerings to it daily. Typically, however, only during the Cow Holiday, an annual event, is the cow the recipient of such practices ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;65). Margul suggests that sanctity of the cow is based on four foundations: abstaining from cow slaughter, abstaining from beef consumption, control of breeding and ownership, and belief in purification qualities of cow products (milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine) ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&nbsp;65-66).\n\n===Sheep===\n{{Main|Sheep#In religion and folklore}}\nThe Ancient Egyptians worshipped \nseveral gods with the head of a ram, including [[Khnum]], [[Heryshaf]], [[Banebdjedet]], [[Ra]] (sometimes) and [[Kherty]].\n[[Amun]], the god of [[Thebes, Egypt]], was also associated with the ram, and in later periods was sometimes represented as ram-headed. His worshippers held the ram to be sacred, however, it was sacrificed once a year. Its fleece formed the clothing of the idol ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\n===Goat===\n{{Main|Goat#Religion, mythology, and folklore}}\n[[File:Mosaic Pan Genazzano Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|Pavement mosaic with the head of Pan. Roman artwork, Antonine period, 138\u2013192 CE.]]\n[[Silenus]], the [[Satyr]]s and the [[Faun]]s were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, [[Leszi]], is believed to have a goat's horns, ears and legs ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). A deity known as the Goat of [[Mendes]] is associated with the [[pentagram]].\n\nIn Greece, Italy, and Egypt, the goat was worshipped in both goat form and phallic form ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8). This type of worship has sometimes been said to have originated from the goat's increased sex drive. One male goat was capable of fertilizing 150 females ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8). The Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was depicted as having goat characteristics, such as hooves, horns, and a beard. Along with Pan, the goat was closely related to Dionysus during the Roman era ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8). To honor Dionysus, Romans would tear apart a goat and eat it alive.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The goat was commonly associated with dark arts and the devil. This association was amplified in Egypt during the Middle Ages ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&nbsp;8).{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nExcavations in Central Asia have revealed ancient ritual goat-burial that show a religious significance of the goat predominantly in the area ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&nbsp;286). These findings have been used as evidence for a goat-cult of Asia originating either in the Neolithic or Bronze Ages ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&nbsp;286).\n\n===Dog===\n[[Image:Dog worship in Hinduism.jpg|thumb|A dog after being decorated in the [[Kukur tihar]] festival in Nepal.]]\n{{Main|Dogs in religion}}\n\nDogs have a major religious significance among the [[Hindu]]s in [[Nepal]] and some parts of [[India]]. The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival that falls roughly in November every year. In [[Hinduism]], it is believed that the dog is a messenger of ''[[Yama]]'', the god of death, and dogs guard the doors of [[Heaven]]. Socially, they are believed to be the protectors of our homes and lives. So, in order to please the dogs they are going to meet at Heaven's doors after death, so they would be allowed in Heaven, people mark the 14th day of the [[lunar cycle]] in November as '''Kukur-tihar''', as known in Nepali language for the dog's day. This is a day when the dog is worshipped by applying ''[[Tilaka|tika]]'' (the holy vermilion dot), incense sticks and garlanded generally with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flower.\n\nActual dog worship is uncommon. The [[Nosarii]] of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The [[Karang Jiwo|Karang]] of Java had a cult of the red dog, each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In [[Nepal]] it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the [[Harranian]]s dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\n===Horse===\n[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|The Uffington White Horse]]\n{{Main|Horse worship}}\n\n[[Horse worship]] has been practiced by a number of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. There is some reason to believe that [[Poseidon]], like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a [[horse]]. In the cave of [[Phigalia]] [[Demeter]] was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized [[Vegetation deity|corn-spirit]] bore this form. Her priests were called [[Poloi]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"colts\") in [[Laconia]]. The mule and the horse are sacred to the Roman god [[Consus]]. In [[Gaul]] we find a horse-goddess, [[Epona]]. There are also traces of a horse-god, [[Rudiobus]]. [[Hayagriva]] is a horse-headed deity that appears in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Gonds]] in India worship a horse-god, [[Koda Pen]], in the form of a shapeless stone, but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or mare is a common form of the corn-spirit in Europe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nAmong the Balkan culture, swaddling an unmarried person in a horse-girth is a typical ritual. It is thought that the sexual potency of the horse is passed to the individual wrapped in its girth ([[#Reference-idVukanovi\u01071980|Vukanovi\u0107 1980]], p.&nbsp;112). Along with the Balkan swaddling, Virgil's Aeneid bases the founding of the great city of Carthage upon a horse ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&nbsp;32). When the Phoenicians dug up a horse head from the ground they decided to build their city (Carthage) upon that spot because the horse was a sign of success ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&nbsp;32). Thus, Brown argued that the horse was sacred to the Phoenician people ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Brown 1950]], p.&nbsp;32).\n\n===Elephant===\n{{main|Cultural depictions of elephants}}\n\n[[Image:13th century Ganesha statue.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A statue of [[Ganesha]] - the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and obstacle removal]]\nIn [[Thailand]] it is believed that a white [[elephant]] may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept ever afterwards. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and f\u00eated and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore f\u00eated by a whole village. In [[Cambodia]] it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. The cult of the white elephant is also found at [[Ennarea]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). In India, the popular Hindu god [[Ganesha]] has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human.\n\nIn [[Surat]], unmarried An\u0101vil girls participate in a holiday referred to as Alun\u0101m ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&nbsp;393). This holiday is to honor the goddess [[P\u0101rvat\u012b]]. During this celebration, a clay elephant is prepared (most likely to celebrate [[P\u0101rvat\u012b]]'s creation of [[Ganesha]] from a paste of either [[turmeric]] or [[sandalwood]]). Every day, the unmarried women worship this elephant by dancing, singing songs, and abstaining from eating salt. On the final day of Alun\u0101m, the clay elephant is immersed in some body of water ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&nbsp;393).\n\nCertain cultures also used elephant figurines to display the animal's importance. There was evidence of an ancient elephant cult in [[Sumatra]] ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&nbsp;41). Stone elephant figurines were built as \"seats of the souls\" in the Sumatran culture ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&nbsp;41). In [[North Borneo]], however, wooden elephant figurines were placed on the top of a bamboo pole. This bamboo pole was only erected after the tribe chief had collected a certain number of human heads ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&nbsp;41).\n\n==Wild mammals==\n\n===Hare===\nIn North America the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes had as their chief deity a \"mighty great [[hare]]\" to whom they went at death. According to one account he lived in the east, according to another in the north. In his anthropomorphized form he was known as [[Nanabozho|Menabosho]] or [[Michabo]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians also worshipped a hare goddess, named [[Wenut]]. She was associated with the city of [[Hermopolis]], and her image appears on the standard of the Hermopolitan nome.\n\n===Deer===\n[[Image:Diane de Versailles Leochares 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Artemis]] with a deer, the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'' in the Louvre ''Galerie des Caryatides'' that was designed for it]]\nThe [[Deer in mythology|deer]] is important in the mythology of many peoples. To the Greeks it was sacred to the goddess [[Artemis]], while in [[Hinduism]] it is linked to the goddess [[Saraswati]]. The deer also held spiritual significance to the pastoralist cultures of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. The golden stag figurine found in the [[Pazyryk burials]] is one of the most famous pieces of Scythian art.\n\n===Wolf===\n{{Main|Wolves in folklore, religion and mythology}}\n\nIn the story of [[Founding of Rome|Rome's foundation]], wolves are used in totemic imagery. The founding brothers [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]] are raised by a mother wolf, making the wolf the symbolic mother of Rome.\n\nAmong the Ancient Egyptians, the gods [[Anubis]] and [[Wepwawet]] both took the form a wolf, jackal or wild dog, or a man with the head of such a creature. Anubis was a funerary deity, considered the patron of the mummification process and a protector of tombs. In the afterlife, it was he who performed the crucial role in the Weighing of the Heart ceremony that decided the individual's post mortum fate. In earlier times Anubis was the supreme god of the underworld, but he was later replaced in that role by the human-formed [[Osiris]]. It is possible that the Egyptians originally conveived of Anubis as a wild dog because of the animals' location on the outskirts of towns, near the tombs of the dead, or possibly because of their scavengeing of corpses, which led them to congregate near tombs. Wepwawet was a deity more focussed on the world of the living, whose chief role was to 'open the way', whether this be opening the way of the pharaoh to victory in battle, opening the way for the priests in a ritual procession, or any other application. The great antiquity of Wepwawet's worship in Egypt is evidenced by the [[Narmer Palette]], made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs, including the image of a wolf on a standard as a part of a ritual procession. It has been suggested that Wepwawet's depiction as a wolf stems from the animal's keen sense of smell, allowing it to 'open the way' to find something important.\n\n=== Big cats ===\n[[File:Luxor Sekhmet New Kingdom.JPG|thumb|Granite statue of the lion-headed Egyptian deity [[Sekhmet]] from the [[Luxor Temple|temple of Mut at Luxor]], dating to 1403\u20131365 BC, exhibited in the [[National Museum of Denmark]]]]\n{{Anchor|Cats}}\n{{See also|Cultural depictions of lions|Cats in ancient Egypt}}\nThe cult of the [[leopard]] is widely found in West Africa. Among the [[Ashanti people]] a man who kills one is liable to be put to death; no leopard skin may be exposed to view, but a stuffed leopard is worshipped. On the Gold Coast a leopard hunter who has killed his victim is carried round the town behind the body of the leopard; he may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and imitate its movements. In [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] a prince's cap is put upon the head of a dead leopard, and dances are held in its honour ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nIn [[Ancient Egypt]], there were several feline-shaped deities. The earliest attested of these was the goddess [[Mafdet]]. During the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] 2920\u20132770 BC, Mafdet was regarded as the protector of the [[Pharaoh]]'s chambers against [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s and other evil. She was often depicted with the head of a leopard or lynx([[#Reference-idHornblower1943|Hornblower, 1943]]). In later periods, other feline deities were more dominant. There were several [[lion]]-headed deities, included goddesses such as [[Sekhmet]], [[Tefnut]], [[Bastet]] (early form), [[Pakhet]], [[Mehit]] and [[Menhit]], and gods such as [[Maahes]]. All of these were fierce deities, dedicated to destroying the enemies of the gods and the pharaoh. Sekhmet, the most famous Egyptian lion-goddess, was considered a daughter of the chief god [[Ra]] and was worshipped as a beneficent goddess who protected Egypt from pestilence and misfortune([[#Reference-idEngels2001|Engels, 2001]]), though at the same time was greatly feared due to her destructive capabilities, as demonstrated in the [[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]. [[Bastet]], formerly called Bast, was originally worshipped as a fierce lioness, though in later times was 'tamed' and worshipped as a gentler domestic cat. During the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] from 664 BC until the 4th century AD, the practice of mummifying [[Felis|small cat]]s in Bastet's honour grew in popularity. Cat mummies were used as [[votive offering]]s to the goddess, mostly during festivals and by [[pilgrim]]s ([[#Reference-idIkram2015|Ikram, 2015]]). Hundreds of thousands of cat mummies were excavated at cat cemeteries in [[Bubastis]], [[Saqqara]], [[Speos Artemidos]] and [[Gizeh]] ([[#Reference-idConway1891|Conway, 1891]]; [[#Reference-idHerdman1890|Herdman, 1890]]; [[#Reference-idZivie&Lichtenberg2005|Zivie & Lichtenberg, 2005]]).\n\nThere was a lion-god at [[Baalbek]]. The [[Arabic mythology|pre-Islamic Arabs]] worshipped the lion-god [[Yaghuth]]. In modern Africa we find a lion-idol among the [[Balonda]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52). The lion was also sacred to [[Hebat]], the [[mother goddess]] of the [[Hurrians]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn [[Judaism]] the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh \u05d2\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d4 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4, a \"Young Lion\" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. Thus the [[Lion of Judah]] started to be reverenced in some others abrahamic cults, symbolising their prophets, as such as [[Jesus]] and [[Haile Selassie I]], the ''ras'' Tafari.\n\nIn Mesoamerica [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|the jaguar was revered]] as a symbol of fertility and warriorship among the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Olmec]], and had an important role in shamanism.\n\n===Tiger===\n[[File:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Indian goddess [[Durga]] riding a tiger. Guler school, early 18th century.]]\n{{See also|Tiger#Cultural depictions}}\nOf great importance in Chinese myth and culture, the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] is one of the 12 [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]] animals. Also in various [[Chinese art]] and martial art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the [[Chinese dragon]]- the two representing matter and spirit respectively. The [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] ({{zh|c=\u767d\u864e|p=B\u00e1i H\u01d4}}) is one of the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellation]]s. It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (\u897f\u65b9\u767d\u864e), and it represents the [[west]] and the autumn season ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&nbsp;226\u201327).\n\nThe tiger replaces the lion as king of the beasts in cultures of eastern Asia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316 |title=Tiger Culture &#124; Save China's Tigers |publisher=English.savechinastigers.org |accessdate=2009-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212165117/http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316 |archivedate=12 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> representing royalty, fearlessness and wrath. In Chinese children stories, it is often depicted that the stripes on a tiger's forehead represent the character \u738b (\"king\") ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&nbsp;226\u201327).\n\nSome cultures that celebrated tiger worship are still represented contemporarily. In the suburbs of [[Kunming]], China, there is a tourist attraction where the tiger worship of the [[Yi people]] is displayed for visitors. This attraction called the Solar Calendar Square is complete with a growling tiger statue, measuring to be five meters high ([[#Reference-idHarrell&Yongxiang2003|Harrell & Yongxiang 2003]], p.&nbsp;380). In Chuxiong of China, a similar attraction exists. A tiger totem is presented for tourists; the totem portrays the Yi belief of the tiger setting the entire world in motion. A tiger dance of the Shuangbai County is also performed at such places explaining the history of the Yi and their worship of tigers ([[#Reference-idHarrell&Yongxiang2003|Harrell & Yongxiang 2003]], p.&nbsp;380).\n\nAlong with these tourist attractions that display historical practices of the Yi, there is also additional evidence for tiger worship. Tigers were found depicted on small stones. These stones were pierced and worn as amulets, suggesting that the tiger had a certain power of protection for its wearer ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;76). The Queen Mother deity of the west, [[Queen Mother of the West|Hsi Wang Mu]], sometimes possessed a tail of a tiger in her depictions and, like the tiger, was associated with the mountains ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;76). The tiger was also a deity for both the Tungus and the Black Pottery people ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;80).\n\nIn Korean history and culture, a tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirit and a sacred creature that brings good luck \u2013 the symbol of courage and absolute power. It appears in not only the [[Korean foundation mythology]] but also in [[Korean folklore|folklore]], as well as a favorite subject of [[Korean art]] such as [[Korean painting|painting]] and sculpture. For example, the 19th-century painting named \u201cSansindo\u201d (\uc0b0\uc2e0\ub3c4) depicts the guardian spirit of a mountain leaning against a tiger or riding on the back of the animal. The animal is also known to do the errands for the mountain's guardian spirit which is known to wish for peace and the well-being of the village. So, the tiger was ordered by the spiritual guardian of the mountain to give protection and wish for peace in the village. People drew such paintings and hung them in the shrine built in the mountain of the village where memorial rituals were performed regularly. In Buddhism, there is also a shrine that keeps the painting of the guardian spirit of the mountain. Called \u201cSansintaenghwa\u201d, it is depiction of the guardian spirit of the mountain and a tiger.<ref>[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]</ref>\n\nIn many parts of Vietnam, the [[tiger]] is a revered creature. In each village, there might be a tiger temple. This worshiping practice might have stem from the fear of tigers used to raid human settlements in the ancient time. Tigers are admired for their great strength, ferocity and grace. Tiger is also considered a guardian deity. Tiger statutes are usually seen at the entrance of temples and palaces, keeping evil spirits from entering those places.\n\nThe tiger is associated with the [[Hindu]] deities [[Shiva]] and [[Durga]]. In [[Pokhara]], Nepal the tiger festival is known as [[Bagh Jatra]]. Celebrants dance disguised as tigers and \"hunted\". The [[Warli]] tribe of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] worship Waghia the lord of tigers in the form of a shapeless stone ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52). In [[Vietnamese folk religion]] and [[Dongbei folk religion]] tiger-gods are also found.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Monkey===\n[[File:Hear speak see no evil Toshogu.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[three wise monkeys]] over the [[Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b|T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b]] shrine in [[Nikk\u014d]], [[Japan]]]]\n{{Main|Monkey}}\nIn Hinduism the monkey deity, [[Hanuman]], is a prominent figure. He is a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction. In orthodox villages monkeys are safe from harm ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\n[[Chinese religions]] and [[Chinese mythology|mythologies]] give monkeys and apes [[Monkeys in Chinese culture#Religious significance|cultural significance]] as metaphors for people. Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys, for example, [[Sun Wukong]] or \"Monkey King\" is the main protagonist in [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s picaresque novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. In traditional [[Chinese folk religion]], monkeys are supernatural beings that could [[shape shift]] into either monkey-demons or were-monkeys, and legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common. In [[Daoism]], monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed to have longevity like a ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' \"transcendent; immortal\", and to be innately adept at circulating and absorbing ''[[qi]]'' \"breath; life force\" through the Daoist discipline of ''[[daoyin]]'' \"guiding and pulling\". Similar to Daoism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] paradoxically treats monkeys as both wise and foolish animals. On the one hand, the ''[[Jataka tales]]'' say that [[Gautama Buddha]] was a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation; and on the other hand, monkeys symbolized trickery and ignorance, represented by the [[Chan Buddhist]] \"[[mind monkey]]\" metaphor for the unsettled, restless nature of human mentality.\n\nMonkeys are said to be worshipped in [[Togo]]. At [[Porto Novo]], in French West Africa, twins have tutelary spirits in the shape of small monkeys ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nThe hamadryas baboon was sacred to the Ancient Egyptians, and often appeared as a form of a deity. Egyptian deities depicted as baboons include [[Hapi (Son of Horus)]], [[Babi (mythology)]] and [[Thoth]], although the latter is more often shown with the head of an ibis. A group of 6 or 8 baboons were also a common feature in scenes showing the sun god at dawn as he rose over the horizon, with the baboons raising their hands to him in praise. This is probably inspired by the observed behaviour of baboons, as they are known to 'chatter' at sunrise, as if greeting the sun.\n\n===Rodent===\nIn some countries, e.g. India, a small number of temples are dedicated to the worship of wild mice. Whilst widely regarded as a creature to be avoided, for pestilential reasons in such temples the animals are actively encouraged. It is frequently associated with Ganesh. As a creature capable of survival, it is to be revered and respected.\n\n==Birds==\n===Crow/raven===\n{{Main|Raven in mythology}}\n\nThe [[Raven]] is the chief deity of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people of [[Alaska]]. All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a culture hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). A raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the \"Raven\" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.\n\nIn the creator role, and in the Raven's role as the [[totem]] and [[Apical ancestor|ancestor]] of one of the four northwest clan houses, the Raven is often addressed as ''Grandfather Raven''. It is not clear whether this form of address is intended to refer to a [[Creator deity|creator]] Raven who is different from the [[trickster]] Raven, or if it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably.\n\nTogether with the eagle-hawk the crow plays a great part in the mythology of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51). Ravens also play a part in some European mythologies, such as in the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Religions]], where they were connected to [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]] and the [[Morrigan]] in the former and [[Woden]] in the latter.\n\n===Hawk===\nNorth Borneo treated the [[hawk]] as a god, but it was technically the messenger of the people's Supreme God ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). There were rituals that involved the hawk when the natives wished to make decisions about certain events, such as journeys from home, major agricultural work, and war ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). In North [[Borneo]] we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the [[Kenyahs]], the [[Kayans]] and the sea [[Dyaks]]. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk-god, [[Laki Neho]], but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, [[Laki Tenangan]]. [[Singalang Burong]], the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger. For he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nAccording to Florance Waterbury, hawk worship was universal ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;26). This particular bird was \"a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes\" ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;26).\n\nThe hawk is commonly associated with the Egyptian god [[Horus]]. As a god of the sky, divine authority, war, victory and civilisation, Horus became the patron deity of the pharaohs. The souls of former pharaohs were said to be the followers of Horus and therefore, the hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;26). Horus was originally depicted by the Egyptians as a full hawk, but after the Fourth and Fifth Dynasty depictions with a human body and a hawk head became more common. ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;27). Other Egyptian deities shown in the form of a hawk or hawk-headed man include [[Qebehsenuef]], [[Sopdu]], [[Ra]] (not always) and [[Sokar]].\n\nEgypt was not the only location of hawk worshippers. There were several other cultures which held the hawk in high regard. The hawk was a deity on the island of Hawaii and symbolized swift justice ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). Along with the lone island from the Hawaiian archipelago, the Fiji islands also had some tribes who worshipped a hawk god ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&nbsp;62). Furthermore, although animal worshipping is not a part of Sikh culture, a white falcon bird is mostly regarded in Sikhism as it was associated with the sixth guru and especially the tenth guru. The tenth guru would always carry a white falcon perched on his hand when going out to hunt. The tenth guru was known as the Master of White Hawk. Many people believe that the bird carried by Guru Gobind Singh was a hawk, however historians believe that the bird was a gyrfalcon or a saker falcon.\n\n===Frigatebird===\nOn [[Easter Island]] until the 1860s there was a [[Tangata manu]] (Bird man) cult which has left us Paintings and [[Petroglyphs]] of Birdmen (half men half [[frigatebird]]s). The cult involved an annual race to collect the first [[sooty tern]] egg of the season from the islet of [[Motu Iti (Rapa Nui)|Moto Iti]] and take it to [[Orongo]].\n\nThe Frigate Bird Cult is thought to have originated in the Solomon Islands before immigrating to Easter Island where it became obsolete ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&nbsp;374). The Frigate-Bird was a representation of the god [[Makemake (mythology)|Make-make]], the god of the seabird's egg on Easter Island ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&nbsp;374).\n\n===Ibis===\nIn Ancient Egypt, the ibis was considered sacred as it was viewed as a manifestation of [[Thoth]], a god of the moon and wisdom. In art, Thoth was usually depicted as a man with the head of an ibis, or more rarely as a baboon. Sacred ibises were kept and fed in temples in his honour, and mummified ibises were given to him as votive offerings. It is thought that the association of the ibis with Thoth may have originated from the curved shape of the bird's beak, which resembles a crescent moon.\n\n==Other non-mammals==\n===Serpent===\n{{Main|Snake worship }}\n[[Image:Naga3.jpg|thumb| right|The altar where serpent deities are worshipped in a temple in [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Karnataka]], India]]\n[[Image:Quetzalcoatl telleriano.jpg|thumb|right|Quetzalcoatl depicted as a snake devouring a man, from the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]].]]\nThe worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the [[Old World]], and in the Americas ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nIn India [[snake worship]] refers to the high status of [[snake]]s in [[Hindu mythology]]. Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras ([[Naga (mythology)|nagas]]) or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nAt one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Nagaraja and known as the \"king of the serpents\" was worshipped. Instead of the \"king of the serpents,\" actual live snakes were worshipped in South India ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&nbsp;1). The Manasa-cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, [[Manasa]] ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&nbsp;1).\n\nIn Africa the chief centre of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] worship was [[Dahomey]]. but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the ''danh-gbi'' kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. ''Danh-gbi'' has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the [[Betsileo]] of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]], on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;52).\n\nIn Ancient Egyptian religion, serpents had both positive and negative representations. On the one hand, the Egyptians worshipped a number of beneficent snake deities, including [[Wadjet]], [[Renenutet]], [[Meretseger]], [[Nehebkau]] and [[Mehen]]. The [[uraeus]] was a fierce divine cobra that protected Egyptian kings and major deities. On the other hand, the serpent [[Apep|Apophis]] was a malevolent demon, who endeavoured to destroy the chief deity [[Ra]].\n\nThe Sumerians had a serpent god [[Ningizzida]].\n\n===Fish===\n{{Main|Fish in culture}}\n\n[[Image:Dagon1.jpg|thumb|A modern interpretation of Dagon as a \"fish-god\"]]\nAccording to the [[Jewish]] scholar [[Rashi]], the [[Canaan]]ite god [[Dagon]] was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered [[relief]]s suggest a fish-god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&nbsp;51).\n\nIn Japan, there was a deity called Ebisu-gami who, according to Sakurada Katsunori, was widely revered by fishing communities and industries ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;1). Ebisu, in later traditions, normally appeared in the form of a fisherman holding a fishing pole and carrying a red tai (a perch), but would sometimes take the form of a whale, shark, human corpse, or rock ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;1). The general image of Ebisu, however, appears to be the whale or the shark, according to Sakurada ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;2).\n\nDuring Ebisu-gami festivals, there have been legends told of strange fish creatures which have arrived and been considered sacred. Examples of such fish creatures include familiar species of fish with multiple tails ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;2). Sometimes these fish were considered to be simply an offering to the deity. Other times, however, they were considered to be Ebisu himself, visiting on the festival day ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&nbsp;2). Large marine [[megafauna]]s such as whales and [[whale shark]]s (also called as \"Ebisu-shark\") were often referred as Ebisu himself to bring mass of fish among them, and as guardians of fishermen.<ref name=\"\u5927\u85e41955\" />\n\nThe Ancient Egyptian goddess [[Hatmehit]] from the city of [[Mendes]] was depicted as a fish, fish-woman hybrid, or a woman with a fish emblem or crown on her head. She was a goddess of life and protection. Fish, specifically Nile perch, were also held sacred to the Egyptian goddess [[Neith]] at her temple at [[Esna]].{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n===Amphibians===\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians worshipped a goddess in the form of a frog, named [[Heqet]]. She was a goddess of fertility, both the fertility of the land and the fertility of human reproduction. She was particularly associated with the final stages of the Nile flood, as well as the final stages of human birth. She was portrayed as a divine midwife, and was considered the consort of the god [[Khnum]] due to their similar roles.\n\n===Insects===\n\nThe dung beetle, or scarab, was an important symbol in Ancient Egyptian religion. The behaviour of the beetle rolling its ball of dung along the ground was likened to the sun god rolling the sun across the sky. As a result, the beetle god [[Khepri]] received worship in the city of [[Heliopolis]], the main sanctuary of the sun god [[Ra]]. In addition, the birth of young beetles from eggs laid in dung was an important symbol of rebirth, so amulets in the shape of scarabs were often included in tombs.\n\nAnother insect venerated by the Egyptians was the scorpion. The goddess [[Serqet]] was depicted wearing a scorpion on her headdress, and was prayed to in order to heal venomous stings and bites. She was one of a group of four goddesses frequently invoked together to protect the body in funerary customs, the others being [[Isis]], [[Nephthys]] and [[Neith]]. The four were often charged with protecting particular organs, assisting the [[Four Sons of Horus]]. Though less famous than the other three canopic goddesses, Serqet's worship is clearly very ancient, with images of scorpions appearing very early in Egyptian art, and even appearing in the names of several early kings. Though the association of Serqet with the scorpion has long been assumed her original function, recent scholarship has questioned whether the original animal in her headdress may have actually been a waterscorpion, and the association with the land scorpion came later.\n\n==Oracular animals==\nAnimals are frequently used for the purposes of [[divination]].\n[[Bird]]s are especially common in this role, as by their faculty of flight they offer themselves to the interpretation as messengers between the celestial and human spheres. [[Augury]] was a highly developed practice of telling the future from the flight of birds in [[Classical Antiquity]]. The [[dove]] appears as an oracular animal in the story of [[Noah]], and also in [[Thisbe]] in [[Boeotia]] there was a dove-oracle of [[Zeus]]. Animal imagery was also often employed in the [[oracle|oracular utterances]] in Ancient Greece ([[#Reference-idLightfoot2008|Lightfoot 2008]], p.&nbsp;237,&nbsp;fn.&nbsp;105). [[Parrot astrology]] is a form of divination using [[green parakeet]]s which originated in South India and is still practised in modern times ([[#Reference-idNaidu_Ratnala2005|Naidu Ratnala 2005]]).\nIn [[Chinese traditional religion]], the [[tortoise]] is an oracular animal.\n\nA popular North American tradition is [[Groundhog Day]], in which on February 2 each year a groundhog is used to predict whether there will be an early spring.\n\nNotable oracular animals of the modern period include [[Lady Wonder]], [[Punxsutawney Phil]], [[Maggie the Monkey]], [[Lazdeika the Crab]], [[Paul the Octopus]], and [[Sonny Wool]].\n\n==Shamanism and animals==\n{{Main|Shamanism}}\nAnimals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as \"assistant spirits,\" \"guardian spirits,\" and \"helping spirits,\" animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman's work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;228-229). When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman's efforts ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;231).\n\nAn example of animal spirits in Shamanism comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks culture. During a healing procedure, a shaman invokes a number of animal spirits to help him. The spirits arrive and enter his body. The shaman is not possessed by these spirits; he is free to expel them at any time ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;223). His body begins to leap all over the place, symbolizing that his soul is rising, leaving the earth and going up to the sky. It is a bird spirit that is lifting him through the atmosphere and he cries for it to take him higher so he can see further. According to Adolf Friedrich, at this point the shaman's essence has, in fact, transformed into the bird spirit that crossed the threshold into his body ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;223). He finally spots what he is looking for, the soul of his ill patient. Still assisting him, the animal spirits carry the shaman to the patient's soul. The shaman retrieves it and returns the soul to its rightful place, healing the patient. Without the presence of animal spirits, the shaman could not have accomplished such a feat ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&nbsp;231).\n\nIn the Inner Eurasian religion, the transformation of a shaman's essence into an animal spirit is referred to as \"becoming animal\" ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). The importance of animals in this shamanic religion is shown by the capabilities that animals grant to human beings. Without the assistance of animals, humans from Inner Eurasia were not capable of reaching the sky, traveling rapidly throughout the earth, or going beneath the earth's outer crust, all of which were important activities to the culture ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). Heaven was not attainable for a person without the assistance of an eagle. Because of the eagle, an animal, the Inner Eurasians believed that they were capable of achieving their after-life and living in the home of their ancestors and Supreme God after their departure from the earth ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). Heaven was represented by the people in assemblies of animals, usually grouped in sevens or nines ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). When participating in hunting or warfare, Inner Eurasians also took on animal qualities because they believed it would increase their success ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167). Animals were a central part of this religion ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&nbsp;167).\n\n==Religion and animals==\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}\n{{see also|Life release|Buddhist vegetarianism}}\n\nOne of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;234). According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. Thus, the world is not specifically meant for human use and should be shared equally amongst all creatures ([[#Reference-idEpstein1990|Epstein 1990]]). Buddhists recognize that all animals are sentient and are capable of feeling pain, grief, fear, happiness, and hunger ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], pp.&nbsp;234\u2013235). The [[Dalai Lama]] once said \"Even ants and other insects will run away from danger... They have intelligence and want to live too. Why should we harm them?\" ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Qtd. in Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;235). Not believing in inflicting harm on any living, sentient being, some Buddhists also follow a [[vegetarian]] diet to avoid causing pain to animals ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;238).\n\nAvoiding the destruction of life can affect aspects beyond a Buddhist's diet, such as travel plans. In order to avoid crushing any living thing, be it plant, insect, or animal, some Buddhist [[monk]]s do not travel during rainy seasons ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;236). Originally, shortly after Buddhism was first founded, monks traveled during all seasons, but public opinion changed this. The people protested that so much life was crushed and destroyed when monks traveled during the wet season. As a result, monks were required to seek shelter during this season and abstain from journeys ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]], p.&nbsp;22).\n\nLiving creatures, including humans, culminate to form one large, united life-force in the Buddhist religion. Buddhists, therefore, believe that to harm another living creature is to, in fact, harm yourself as all life-forms are interrelated ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;237). There are many tales that depict humans sacrificing their lives so that an animal may live. A [[jataka]], or previous incarnation story, tells how the Buddha, (upon hearing the distraught cries of a lioness struggling to feed her hungry cubs), leapt from a cliff and smashed his body to death as an offering, so that she could feed his flesh to them ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]]).\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{main|Cow protection movement|Cattle slaughter in India|Elephants in Kerala culture|Lion Capital of Ashoka}}\n{{see also|Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Ashvamedha}}\n\n[[Hinduism]] is one of the six primary [[Religions in India|religions]] of [[India]] ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;221). Hinduism has evolved over several centuries from [[Vedas|Vedic]] times when there was no restriction on animal worship and also animal consumption for food, to later [[Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]]-influenced [[eras]] that led to a wider concept adoption of [[non-violence]] or [[ahimsa]] and respect for animals, as a major constituent in [[Dharmic]] belief systems ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;223). Humans and animals are believed to be one family and therefore, humans should treat all living creatures with respect and kindness. It is also believed that human beings themselves [[Re-incarnation|re-incarnate]] as animals based on their deeds or [[karma]]. Pets are often treated as if they are truly members of the family ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;223-224).\n\nThere are some exceptions to ahimsa in Hinduism - mainly dealing with religious rituals to please gods on [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism#Animal sacrifice in contemporary Hindu society|special occasions]] and for daily sustenance. While Hindu belief proscribes the slaughter for human pleasure or lavishness {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, animal sacrifice has been an accepted ritual in ''some'' parts of India ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;225).An example of such lavishness would be hunting for pleasure, a fur coat made from animal skin, etc. An explanation for this supposed paradox is that a sacrificial animal is not really considered to be an animal, but a symbol. Thus, when the animal is sacrificed, they are sacrificing the symbol and not the animal ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;226).\n\n===Jainism===\n{{main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}\n{{see also|Jain vegetarianism}}\n\n[[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Teerthankar]] of [[Jainism]], believed that the only way to be released from the cycle of life (birth, death, and then rebirth), one must follow ahimsa and not harm any living creature ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;229). Some Jains will carry a broom with them and sweep their path as they walk to avoid stepping on any living creature. Jains will also wear masks over their mouths to prevent swallowing insects and inspect their fruit for worms. The fruit inspection is not, however, because of their aversion of worms, but for the protection of the worms themselves ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;229-230). Jains are also only allowed to eat during daylight hours, when their vision is not restricted, so that they avoid eating insects or other small creatures that could possibly be in their food ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;230).\n\nJainism includes a lay form which is somewhat less restrictive ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;231). Basically lay Jains must distinguish between what forms of violence are necessary and unnecessary, but do not have to abstain entirely ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&nbsp;5). This results in avoiding all forms of hunting, tilling the soil (tilling involved disturbing creatures embedded in the earth), and brewing (brewing involved using living organisms such as yeasts) ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;231).\n\nFood will never be prepared especially for them. They beg for food from others believing that because the food was prepared for someone else, they are not the cause of violence towards living creatures ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&nbsp;5).\n\nLay Jains, who have the financial capacity, will visit animal markets and buy/rescue animals destined for slaughter for the good that it does. ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&nbsp;232).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Animals}}\n* [[Animal welfare]]\n* [[Animal-assisted therapy]]\n* [[Animism]]\n* [[Anthrozoology]]\n* [[Moral status of animals in the ancient world]]\n* [[Nature worship]]\n* [[Totemism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|id=idBaldick2000|reference=Baldick, Julian (2000). \"Animal and Shaman: Ancient Religions of Central Asia\" New York University Press, New York}}\n* {{wikicite|id=idBalfour1917|reference=Balfour, Henry (1917). \"Some Ethnological Suggestions in Regard to Easter Island, or Rapanui\" Folklore, '''28'''(4). }}\n* {{wikicite|id=idBhattacharyya1965|reference=Bhattacharyya, Asutosh (1965). \"The Serpent as a Folk-Deity in Bengal\" Asian Folklore Studies, '''24'''(1). }}\n* {{wikicite|id=idBird2007|reference=[[Jonathan Bird|Bird, Jonathan]] (2007). \"[http://www.oceanicresearch.org/education/wonders/spermwhales.htm Sperm Wales: The deep rivers of the ocean]\".
