{"title_page": "List of museums in Somerset", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{kml}}\n\nThe [[Ceremonial counties of England|English ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]] contains a wide range of [[museum]]s, defined here as institutions (including [[nonprofit organisation]]s, government entities, and private businesses) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Non-profit [[Art museum|art galleries]] and university art galleries are also included, but museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., [[virtual museum]]s) are not.\n\nMany of the museums are in [[listed building]]s. In the United Kingdom, this signifies a building which has been placed on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. In [[England and Wales]], the authority for listing is granted by the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]], and is administered by [[English Heritage]]. Listed buildings in danger of decay are included on English Heritage's [[Heritage at Risk Register]]. There are three types of listed status: Grade I, for buildings \"of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\"; Grade II*, for \"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\"; and Grade II, for buildings that are \"nationally important and of special interest\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Listed buildings |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/protecting/heritage-protection/what-can-we-protect/listed-buildings/ |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=30 May 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710155806/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/protecting/heritage-protection/what-can-we-protect/listed-buildings/ |archivedate=10 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMany of the museums have been accredited by the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]], which sets national standards for museums in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |title=Accreditation Scheme |url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/raising_standards/accreditation |publisher=The [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA) |accessdate=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722053349/http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/raising_standards/accreditation |archivedate=22 July 2010 }}</ref> Several are [[art gallery|art galleries]] providing space for the [[art exhibition|exhibition of art]], or are [[Philatelic Museum|philatelic]], [[Regimental museum|regimental]], [[Science museum|science]], [[Aviation museum|aviation]], [[Transport museum|transport]], [[Railway museum|railway]], [[Toy museum|toy]], religious or sports museums, but the majority are [[local museum]]s.
