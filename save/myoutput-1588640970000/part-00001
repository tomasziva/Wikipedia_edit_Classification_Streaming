After clearing 1 building of opposition, he moved his men toward a second house from which heavy machine-gun fire came. He courageously exposed himself to hostile bullets and, firing his submachinegun as he went, advanced steadily toward the enemy position until close enough to hurl grenades through a window, killing 3 Germans and wrecking their gun. His progress was stopped by heavy rifle and machinegun fire from another house. Sgt. Deleau dashed through the door with his gun blazing. Within, he captured 10 Germans. The squad then took up a position for the night and awaited daylight to resume the attack. At dawn of 2 February Sgt. Deleau pressed forward with his unit, killing 2 snipers as he advanced to a point where machinegun fire from a house barred the way. Despite vicious small-arms fire, Sgt. Deleau ran across an open area to reach the rear of the building, where he destroyed 1 machinegun and killed its 2 operators with a grenade. He worked to the front of the structure and located a second machinegun. Finding it impossible to toss a grenade into the house from his protected position, he fearlessly moved away from the building and was about to hurl his explosive when he was instantly killed by a burst from the gun he sought to knock out. With magnificent courage and daring aggressiveness, Sgt. Deleau cleared 4 well-defended houses of Germans, inflicted severe losses on the enemy and at the sacrifice of his own life aided his battalion to reach its objective with a minimum of casualties.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|World War II}}\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II#D|List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite web |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |url=http://www.worldwariihistory.info/Medal-of-Honor/France.html |title=World War II History Info - France}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Find a Grave|8498244|work=Claim to Fame: Medal of Honor recipients|accessdate=2008-07-02}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deleau, Emile}}\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:1945 deaths]]\n[[Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients]]\n[[Category:American army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:United States Army soldiers]]\n[[Category:People from Belmont County, Ohio]]\n[[Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|name= Emile Deleau Jr.\n|birth_date= {{Birth date|1923|6|28}}\n|death_date= {{Death date and age|1945|2|2|1923|6|28}}\n|birth_place= [[Lansing, Ohio]]\n|death_place= [[Oberhoffen-sur-Moder|Oberhoffen]], [[France]]\n|placeofburial=\n|placeofburial_label= Place of burial\n|image= \n|caption=\n|nickname=\n|allegiance= [[United States|United States of America]]\n|branch= [[United States Army]]\n|serviceyears= 1943 - 1945\n|rank= [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]]\n|commands=\n|unit= [[142nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|142nd Infantry Regiment]]\n|battles= [[World War II]]\n|awards= [[Medal of Honor]]\n|laterwork=\n}}\n'''Emile Deleau Jr.''' (June 28, 1923 \u2013 February 2, 1945) was an American soldier who received the [[Medal of Honor]] for actions in France during [[World War II]].
