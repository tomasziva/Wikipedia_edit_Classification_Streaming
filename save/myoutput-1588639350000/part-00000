Farmers Loan and Trust]]'' in 1894, this law helped them to be fully equipped to fight the power of the railroads.<ref name=hendrickson125/>\n\nIn April 1893, the legislature passed a law requiring that communities which issued bonds should also have a plan to collect sufficient taxes to pay the interest. Hogg's final campaign promise was fulfilled when the legislature passed the Perpetuities and Corporation Land Law, which required private corporations to sell all land they had held for speculative purposes within 15&nbsp;years<ref name=hendrickson125/> The law was full of loopholes and did not have the effect that Hogg wanted.<ref name=hendrickson126/>\n\nIn 1894, Texas filed a lawsuit against [[John D.

Hogg and his attorney general argued that the companies were engaged in rebates, [[price fixing]], consolidation, and other tactics prohibited by the state's 1889 antitrust act. The investigation resulted in a number of indictments, including one for Rockefeller. Hogg requested that Rockefeller be [[extradition|extradited]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], but the New York governor refused, as Rockefeller had not fled from Texas. Rockefeller was never tried, but other employees of the company were found guilty.<ref name=hendrickson127>Hendrickson (1995), p. 127.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nHogg's term as governor ended in 1895, the same year his wife died. Although he was not wealthy when he left office, through his connections he became involved in land and oil deals and amassed a large fortune.<ref name=hendrickson130/>\n\nHe spoke on behalf of [[William Jennings Bryan]] in [[Tammany Hall]] in 1896 and 1900. Hogg also became interested in the idea of what became the [[Panama Canal]]; having done well as an oil investor, Hogg had interest for a shipping route to open between Texas and [[South America]], as well as between Texas and [[Asia]]. On April 19, 1900, he gave a speech in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], where he said the now legendary words: \"Let us have Texas, the Empire State, (be) governed by the people, not Texas, the truckpatch, ruled by corporate [[lobbyist]]s\".\n\n[[Image:Jim Hogg Road, I-20, TX IMG 6598.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Jim Hogg Road exit in [[Smith County, Texas|Wood County]] off [[Interstate 20]] northwest of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], [[Texas]]]]\n[[File:HoggMS1.jpg|thumb|Hogg Middle School in [[Norhill, Houston]]]]\nJim Hogg's popularity extended beyond Texas, particularly in New York. The \"Man in the Street\" column in the edition of September 6, 1903 of ''[[The New York Times]]'' related the following anecdote regarding him:\n\n{{quote|Ex-Gov. Hogg of Texas, who has a reputation for liking to play a practical joke every time he gets a chance, says he has been cured of the habit.  The last time he was in New York the joke he tried to perpetrate was turned back at him in great style.  It happened that he wanted a shoe shine.  The bootblack, a small-sized [[Italian American|Italian]], began to chatter at him after he had taken his seat in the high chair.  Not being in a conversational frame of mind, the portly Governor thought it would be a good plan to feign that he was deaf and dumb.  So he responded by signs to everything the bootblack said.\n\nThis proceeding naturally caused the desired silence on the part of the Italian, and the Governor was wrapped in his own thoughts, when suddenly a little newsboy ran up and asked him if he wanted a paper.  Before he could reply the bootblack turned to the boy and said:\n\n:\"You nota talka to him.  He deaf.\"\n\n''The newsboy looked him over, says the Governor, and then remarked in a loud voice:\n\n:\"Well, say, he's a fat old hog, ain't he?\"\n\nThe Governor, who weighs 300 pounds or more, relishes telling the story, but he adds feelingly that he kept up his bluff after hearing the brutal comment of the newsboy.|Man in the Street|New York Times, 1903}}\n\nIn January 1905, Hogg was injured in a railroad accident while on a business trip. He never completely recovered and died in his sleep on March 3, 1906, at the age of 54. He is buried in [[Oakwood Cemetery (Austin, TX)|Oakwood Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>Hendrickson (1995), p. 131.</ref>\n\n[[Jim Hogg County, Texas|Jim Hogg County]] southeast of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] is named after him.\n\nIn addition James S.

Hogg requested that Rockefeller be [[extradition|extradited]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], but the New York governor refused, as Rockefeller had not fled from Texas. Rockefeller was never tried, but other employees of the company were found guilty.<ref name=hendrickson127>Hendrickson (1995), p. 127.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nHogg's term as governor ended in 1895, the same year his wife died. Although he was not wealthy when he left office, through his connections he became involved in land and oil deals and amassed a large fortune.<ref name=hendrickson130/>\n\nHe spoke on behalf of [[William Jennings Bryan]] in [[Tammany Hall]] in 1896 and 1900. Hogg also became interested in the idea of what became the [[Panama Canal]]; having done well as an oil investor, Hogg had interest for a shipping route to open between Texas and [[South America]], as well as between Texas and [[Asia]]. On April 19, 1900, he gave a speech in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], where he said the now legendary words: \"Let us have Texas, the Empire State, (be) governed by the people, not Texas, the truckpatch, ruled by corporate [[lobbyist]]s\".\n\n[[Image:Jim Hogg Road, I-20, TX IMG 6598.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Jim Hogg Road exit in [[Smith County, Texas|Wood County]] off [[Interstate 20]] northwest of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], [[Texas]]]]\n[[File:HoggMS1.jpg|thumb|Hogg Middle School in [[Norhill, Houston]]]]\nJim Hogg's popularity extended beyond Texas, particularly in New York. The \"Man in the Street\" column in the edition of September 6, 1903 of ''[[The New York Times]]'' related the following anecdote regarding him:\n\n{{quote|Ex-Gov. Hogg of Texas, who has a reputation for liking to play a practical joke every time he gets a chance, says he has been cured of the habit.  The last time he was in New York the joke he tried to perpetrate was turned back at him in great style.  It happened that he wanted a shoe shine.  The bootblack, a small-sized [[Italian American|Italian]], began to chatter at him after he had taken his seat in the high chair.  Not being in a conversational frame of mind, the portly Governor thought it would be a good plan to feign that he was deaf and dumb.  So he responded by signs to everything the bootblack said.\n\nThis proceeding naturally caused the desired silence on the part of the Italian, and the Governor was wrapped in his own thoughts, when suddenly a little newsboy ran up and asked him if he wanted a paper.  Before he could reply the bootblack turned to the boy and said:\n\n:\"You nota talka to him.  He deaf.\"\n\n''The newsboy looked him over, says the Governor, and then remarked in a loud voice:\n\n:\"Well, say, he's a fat old hog, ain't he?\"\n\nThe Governor, who weighs 300 pounds or more, relishes telling the story, but he adds feelingly that he kept up his bluff after hearing the brutal comment of the newsboy.|Man in the Street|New York Times, 1903}}\n\nIn January 1905, Hogg was injured in a railroad accident while on a business trip. He never completely recovered and died in his sleep on March 3, 1906, at the age of 54. He is buried in [[Oakwood Cemetery (Austin, TX)|Oakwood Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>Hendrickson (1995), p. 131.</ref>\n\n[[Jim Hogg County, Texas|Jim Hogg County]] southeast of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] is named after him.\n\nIn addition James S. Hogg Middle School in [[Norhill, Houston]], of the [[Houston Independent School District]], is named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonisd.org/Page/32483|title=School Histories Middle Schools|publisher=[[Houston Independent School District]]|accessdate=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n==Burial==\nIn 1906, Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg asked that a [[pecan]] tree be planted at his grave instead of a traditional headstone, requesting that the seeds be distributed throughout the state to make Texas a \"Land of Trees\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpga.org|title=Texas Pecan Growers official site}}</ref> His wish was carried out and this brought more attention to pecan trees. In 1919, the 36th Texas Legislature made the pecan tree the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Texas]] where the town of [[San Saba, Texas|San Saba]] claims to be \"The Pecan Capital of the World\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sansabatexas.com|title=Town website for San Saba, Texas|publisher=Town of San Saba Texas}}</ref> Several other American towns and regions host annual events celebrating the pecan harvest.\n\n==Removal of statue==\nIn the early morning of August 22, 2017, the University of Texas removed three Confederate monuments and a [[Statue of Jim Hogg|statue of Hogg]]. The university president said the removal was because of the violent protests at the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite news |title=College in Texas Removes Confederate Monuments |date=August 22, 2017 |author=Jonah Engel Bromwich |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/08/20/ut-austin-removing-confederate-statues-middle-night/|title=UT-Austin removes Confederate statues in the middle of the night|author=Matthew Watkins|date=August 22, 2017|publisher=Texas Tribune}}</ref>  However, in December 2018, the statue will be reinstalled in another part of campus, unlike the other removed statues, who were all officials in the Confederacy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Texas}}\n*[[Sid McMath]], a distant cousin of Hogg's who served as [[Governor of Arkansas]] (1949\u20131953) and who has been historically compared with him.\n*''[[The Hogg Family and Houston]]'', a book about the family\n*[http://www.houstonisd.org/domain/38862 James S.
