First, he seized (Heb. t\u0101pa\u015b, \u201clay hold of\u201d) her and then lay down (\u0161\u0101kab) with her, '''a clear case of violent, coercive behavior'''.\"<ref>New American Commentary, Merrill, E.

The Hebrew word for violated is \u05e2\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4/anah, which means to be bowed down, afflicted.  Every other time this word is used to describe two people interacting, it is always describing a man forcing a woman to have sex against her will (i.e., rape):\n\n* Later, if you no longer want her, you are to let her go free. Since you '''forced''' her to have intercourse with you (Hebrew: anah), you cannot treat her as a slave and sell her.

But in [[Leviticus 19]]:20-22, the master who rapes a slave girl who had been previously betrothed to another man, is forgiven of the sin by simply giving up one of his animals to the priests. Some inerrantist Christian scholars agree it is reasonable to view this as \"rape\" and not merely consensual fornication:\n\n\"It is worth noting that only the man was considered blameworthy, not the female slave. Being a slave, '''the woman may have felt she had little recourse in resisting a male who was a free man''' and thus more powerful both in the social and economic spheres.\"<ref>New American Commentary, Rooker, M. F. (2001, c2000).

This resulted from loopholes in laws that allow for marriage below the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]], thus circumventing [[statutory rape]] laws.\n\n==== Missouri ====\n{{See also|Ages of consent in the United States#Missouri}}\nThe age of consent in Missouri is 17. According to a March 2018 article in the ''[[Journal Star (Peoria)]]'', more than 300 men aged 21 or older married with 15-year-old girls in the state of Missouri between 1999 and 2015. For the men who had premarital sex with the girls they later married, this would constitute [[statutory rape]] according to Missouri law, which defines statutory rape as \"anyone 21 or older having sex with someone younger than 17 outside of marriage\". However, sex is legal within marriage, even with a minor, and Missouri allowed marriage from the age of 15 until August 2018, when a law passed establishing a minimum age of 16 and forbidding marriages between someone under 18 and someone over 21.<ref>https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article214840670.html</ref> This created a loophole by which statutory rape could be covered up if the marriage is concluded before the authorities found out sexual intercourse has taken place (especially if it resulted in a pregnancy). This allowed for the suspect to be exempt from prosecution (for example, imprisonment and having to register as a sex offender). Social pressure could be put on the alleged victim to agree to marry her statutory rapist to make him avoid punishment. Moreover, because of Missouri's age loophole, a number of out-of-state couples travelled to Missouri to marry.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/20180318/hundreds-of-missouris-15-year-old-brides-may-have-married-their-rapists |title=Hundreds of Missouri\u2019s 15-year-old brides may have married their rapists |author=Eric Adler |work=[[Journal Star (Peoria)]] |date=18 March 2018 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Florida ====\n{{See also|Ages of consent in the United States#Florida}}\nThe age of consent in Florida is 18. However, until March 2018, the state of Florida allowed marriage without any minimum age for a girl if she was pregnant and a judge approved of the marriage. In this manner, the man who impregnated her could avoid being prosecuted for statutory rape. The current law requires anyone seeking marriage to be at least 18 years old, or 17 with the other partner not being more than two years older and the minor having received parental consent; pregnancy is no longer a factor.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/10/forced-marry-her-rapist-11-woman-finally-changes-florida-marriage-law/413284002/ |title=Forced to marry her rapist at 11, woman finally changes Florida marriage law |author=Brendan Farrington |work=USA Today |date=10 March 2018 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Family law}}\n\n== Laws by country ==\n''Note: The table can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the [[File:Sort both.gif]] icons.''\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+ '''Marry-your-rapist laws by country or territory'''\n!

But in [[Leviticus 19]]:20-22, the master who rapes a slave girl who had been previously betrothed to another man, is forgiven of the sin by simply giving up one of his animals to the priests. Some inerrantist Christian scholars agree it is reasonable to view this as \"rape\" and not merely consensual fornication:\n\n\"It is worth noting that only the man was considered blameworthy, not the female slave. Being a slave, '''the woman may have felt she had little recourse in resisting a male who was a free man''' and thus more powerful both in the social and economic spheres.\"<ref>New American Commentary, Rooker, M. F. (2001, c2000).

This section encompassed a certain legal code that was meant to protect the \"virginity\" of women. It was not until 1924 when legislation was passed which stated that rapists were legally able to be exempt from sexual assault charges through a loophole. In cases of rape and to serve as a punishment for the perpetrator, the victim was required to enter into a marriage with their rapist.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mujica|first=Jaris|date=November 2011|title=Violaciones sexuales en el Per\u00fa 2000-2009: un informe sobre el estado de la situaci\u00f3n|url=|journal=UNFPA|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The notion that marriage could possibly restore a raped woman's honor has been linked to the countries historical, patriarchal, and gender norms. In 1991, this law was modified to absolve co-conspirators in a gang rape case if one of them marries the victim.

This resulted from loopholes in laws that allow for marriage below the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]], thus circumventing [[statutory rape]] laws.\n\n==== Missouri ====\n{{See also|Ages of consent in the United States#Missouri}}\nThe age of consent in Missouri is 17. According to a March 2018 article in the ''[[Journal Star (Peoria)]]'', more than 300 men aged 21 or older married with 15-year-old girls in the state of Missouri between 1999 and 2015. For the men who had premarital sex with the girls they later married, this would constitute [[statutory rape]] according to Missouri law, which defines statutory rape as \"anyone 21 or older having sex with someone younger than 17 outside of marriage\". However, sex is legal within marriage, even with a minor, and Missouri allowed marriage from the age of 15 until August 2018, when a law passed establishing a minimum age of 16 and forbidding marriages between someone under 18 and someone over 21.<ref>https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article214840670.html</ref> This created a loophole by which statutory rape could be covered up if the marriage is concluded before the authorities found out sexual intercourse has taken place (especially if it resulted in a pregnancy). This allowed for the suspect to be exempt from prosecution (for example, imprisonment and having to register as a sex offender). Social pressure could be put on the alleged victim to agree to marry her statutory rapist to make him avoid punishment. Moreover, because of Missouri's age loophole, a number of out-of-state couples travelled to Missouri to marry.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/20180318/hundreds-of-missouris-15-year-old-brides-may-have-married-their-rapists |title=Hundreds of Missouri\u2019s 15-year-old brides may have married their rapists |author=Eric Adler |work=[[Journal Star (Peoria)]] |date=18 March 2018 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Florida ====\n{{See also|Ages of consent in the United States#Florida}}\nThe age of consent in Florida is 18.
