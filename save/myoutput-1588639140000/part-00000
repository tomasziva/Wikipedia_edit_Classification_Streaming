Previously the portfolio was held by the Minister of Employment and Social Development. The board of directors and president are appointed by the Government of Canada.\n\nAs Canada's national housing agency, CMHC contributes to the stability of the housing market and financial system, provides support to Canadians in housing need, and offers objective housing research and advice to Canadian governments, consumers and the housing industry.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CMHC headquarters Building A.jpg|thumb|CMHC headquarters, at [[Montreal Road]] and the [[Aviation Parkway (Ottawa)|Aviation Parkway]], [[Ottawa]]]]\nNear the end of [[World War II]], the Canadian government began to worry about the demobilization of thousands of soldiers in Europe, and their re-entrance to Canadian society.\n\nWith so many people coming back to Canada, a number of problems could arise, one being that there may not be enough housing existing to accommodate the soldiers and their families.\n\nAs such, on 1 January 1946 Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation was created (changed to \"Canada\" Mortgage and Housing Corporation in 1979) to house returning war veterans and to lead Canada's housing programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/index.cfm|title=History of CMHC {{!}} CHMC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909232847/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/index.cfm|archive-date=9 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCMHC's basic functions were to administer the ''National Housing Act'' and the ''Home Improvement Loans Guarantee Act'' and provide discounting facilities for loan and mortgage companies. The capital of the Corporation was set at $25 million (a substantial amount for the times), and a reserve fund of $5 million authorized to be accumulated from profits. This requirement and capital structure are still in effect today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/|title=History of CMHC {{!}} CHMC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910174447/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/|archive-date=10 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of the 1940s, the Government of Canada embarked on a program of much-needed social and rental housing, creating a federal-provincial public housing program for low-income families, with costs and subsidies shared 75% by the federal government and 25% by the province.\n\nIn 1947, CMHC took over the assets of Wartime Housing Ltd., another federal Crown corporation that had built thousands of rental housing units for war workers and veterans during the 6 years it was in operation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jill|first=Wade|date=1984-01-01|title=Wartime Housing Limited, 1941-1947 : an overview and evaluation of Canada's first national housing corporation|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0096317|doi=10.14288/1.0096317}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Ajax, Ontario, was constructed and operated by Wartime Housing Limited (1941 to 1949) in order to provide much-needed housing for munitions workers and returning veterans. In 1948, CMHC was given responsibility for Ajax. Its biggest challenges in establishing Ajax as a functioning municipality were reimbursing Pickering Township and Ontario County for municipal services provided to Ajax and establishing an official plan for the growing community acceptable to relevant government agencies. After considerable controversy regarding land and water control, CMHC submitted a successful application to the Ontario Municipal Board in May 1950 making Ajax an improvement district. This was the first step toward municipal status<!-- What does this mean?

Regent Park in Toronto is the first urban renewal project, where 42 acres (17&nbsp;ha) were cleared to build the 1056-unit, low-rent housing development in 1950. [[Habitations Jeanne-Mance]] in Montreal is another example. For further examples, see [[List of public housing projects in Canada]].\n\nIn 1951, CMHC started implementing the first of many federal-provincial public housing projects with 140 subsidized rent-to-income units in St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\nIn 1954, the federal government expanded the ''National Housing Act'' to allow chartered banks to enter the NHA lending field. CMHC introduced mortgage loan insurance, taking on mortgage risks with a 25% down payment, making home ownership more accessible to Canadians.\n\nThe banks thereafter began to issue mortgage loans with CMHC underwriting. If the individual receiving the loan went bankrupt then the bank who gave the loan would not lose money, but instead would be reimbursed by the government. As part of CMHC lending and insurance mechanisms, low-risk borrowers would have to pay insurance premiums if they wanted to borrow with small down payments.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CMHC built the first co-operative housing and, for the first time in Canadian history, multi-unit apartment buildings were beginning to outpace housing starts for single-family homes.\n\nThrough ongoing research with the building industry, CMHC raised Canadian housing standards to be among the best in the world. The construction of Habitat for Expo 67 in Montr\u00e9al led to many advances in materials and construction.\n\nIn 1967, CMHC published Canadian Wood Frame House Construction which became an on-site resource for small builders and trades. Preservation of historic neighbourhoods and downtown living became a priority and, in 1973, CMHC oversaw the transformation of Vancouver's Granville Island, a run-down industrial area, into a thriving centre for culture, recreation and tourism.\n\nIn 1974, CMHC introduced the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RRAP) to repair substandard homes to a minimum level of health and safety and to improve the accessibility of housing for disabled persons.\n\nDuring that decade, CMHC also turned its attention to Aboriginal and rural housing, introducing the Winter Warmth Assistance Program in 1971, the first of its kind to provide funds to Aboriginals for urgent repairs to housing in rural areas.\n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government withdrew from the financing of public housing projects. CMHC no longer directed funds to municipalities for the building of housing projects. Some government housing funds and mortgage guarantees since then have been provided for individual projects.\n\nThe 1990s introduced a new era of science and technology, including the development of FlexHousing\u2122, barrier-free housing, and Healthy Housing\u2122, a concept of energy efficiency and resource conservation in home construction.\n\nHowever, despite these advances, affordability remained a concern, particularly in the early 1990s as a result of the ongoing recession, layoffs and socio-economic uncertainty.\n\nCMHC created the Canadian Centre for Public-Private Partnerships in Housing in 1991, aimed at fostering public/private cooperation in housing projects.\n\nIn 1996, CMHC introduced \"emili\", an automated insurance underwriting system that moves application approval times from days to seconds\u2014making it easier for Canadian homebuyers to obtain mortgage loan insurance.\n\nIn 1999, the ''National Housing Act'' and the ''Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act'' were modified, allowing for the introduction of a 5% down payment\u2014a change launched as a pilot in 1992, extended and finalized in 1999\u2014removing a significant barrier for first-time home buyers. CMHC also expanded its activities internationally and launched the Canadian Housing Export Centre (later renamed CMHC International) to share Canada's housing expertise with the world.\n\nHousing affordability received a boost in 2001 through CMHC's introduction of Canada Mortgage Bonds, aimed at ensuring the supply of low-cost mortgage funding and keeping interest low.\n\nIn 2002, CMHC was recognized for its innovative work, receiving the Conference Board of Canada's National Award in Governance in the Public Sector, presented to boards of directors that have demonstrated excellence in governance and have implemented successful innovations in their governance practices.\n\nHomelessness, assisted housing and Aboriginal housing gained more prominence in the first half of the decade. In 2003, the federal-provincial affordable housing program began, with $1 billion in federal expenditure to improve affordable housing supply by an estimated 23,500 units.\n\nIn 2005, CMHC introduced a 10 per cent \"green refund\" on mortgage loan insurance premiums for homeowners who buy or build an energy-efficient home, or who make energy-saving renovations to their existing homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/moloin/moloin_008.cfm|title=CMHC \u2014 Energy-efficient Housing Made More Affordable with Mortgage Loan Insurance {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref>\n\nCMHC also introduced two on-reserve loan insurance products during the first half of the decade, enabling Band Councils or Aboriginal persons to access CMHC-insured financing for the construction, purchase or renovation of single-family homes or multiple residential properties, and an insurance pilot designed to increase market housing on-reserve.\n\n==Mortgage loan insurance==\nCMHC's mortgage loan insurance products facilitate access to a range of housing options for Canadians and promote and contribute to the stability of the financial system. CMHC's commercial operations contribute to improving the Government of Canada's fiscal position through its net income and income taxes paid.\n\nMortgage loan insurance is mandatory for federally regulated lenders in Canada when the buyer of a home has less than a 20 per cent down payment.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_004.cfm|title=Mortgage Loan Insurance {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020041015/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_004.cfm|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> This insurance protects the mortgage lender against loss if a borrower defaults, and allows qualified borrowers to access homeownership at interest rates comparable to those offered to buyers with larger down payments.\n\nAs a public mortgage insurer, CMHC has a mandate to provide service in all parts of the country and for a range of housing forms.<ref name=\":0\" /> A significant portion of CMHC's mortgage loan insurance business is in markets or for housing options that are not served or less served by private mortgage insurers. In addition to being the primary insurer for housing in small and rural communities, CMHC is the only insurer of mortgages for multi-unit residential properties, including large rental buildings, student housing and nursing and retirement homes.\n\n==Affordable housing==\nCMHC, on behalf of the Government of Canada, invests approximately $2 billion annually to help reduce the number of Canadians in housing need. This includes significant funding for social housing. Ongoing subsidies are provided under 25- to 50-year operating agreements with housing groups who provide affordable housing to those in need. Approximately 80 per cent of the existing social housing portfolio is administered by provinces and territories under long-term agreements with CMHC. The remaining 20 per cent is administered by CMHC and includes the on-reserve portfolio and certain federally funded housing units off-reserve, such as housing cooperatives.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_005.cfm|title=Affordable Housing {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020041700/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_005.cfm|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlso as part of the $2 billion annual investment, CMHC provides funding to provinces and territories under the Investment in Affordable Housing (IAH).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCMHC also supports affordable housing through low-cost loans to federally assisted social housing sponsors seeking to finance new projects on-reserve or to renew existing financing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCMHC's Affordable Housing Centre works with the private, public and non-profit sectors to help develop affordable housing that does not require ongoing federal assistance.\n\n==First-time home buyer incentive program==\n\nIn the [[2019 Canadian federal budget|2019 federal budget]], the Canadian government introduced the first-time home buyer incentive program (or FTHBI).<ref>[https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/nhs/canada-first-time-home-buyer-incentive First Time Home Buyer Incentive Program]</ref> The program, run via the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, is a form of [[equity sharing]] intended to help first time buyers with their down payments. The FTHBI allows eligible first-time home buyers to have 5% to 10% of their home down payment subsidized by the government as shared equity. Note that the program is unaffiliated with the Home Buyer Plan<ref>[https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/what-home-buyers-plan.html Home Buyers Plan]</ref> which allows buyers withdraw from their RRSP to increase their down payment. The program launched on September 2, 2019, but only covers purchases closing after November 1, 2019. The buyers must repay the government aid over a period of 15 years.\n\n'''FTHBI Eligibility:'''\nThis program can only be used for down payments below 15% (LTV > 85%). Eligible buyers must have a gross household income not exceeding $120,000.<ref>[https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/media-newsroom/news-releases/2019/federal-government-makes-easier-for-middle-class-canadians-buy-first-home-toronto Quick facts about the FTHBI]</ref> These, along with various other restrictions, limit the effective maximum price of an FTHBI-eligible property to $565,000.<ref>[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/6-things-to-know-about-trudeau-s-first-time-home-buyer-incentive-1.1309143 6 things to know about FTHBI]</ref>  This is far below the median property prices in population centers such as Toronto and Vancouver, leading to concerns regarding the efficacy of the program in these areas. During the federal election campaign of 2019, the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] promised to expand this program to better help buyers in Toronto and Vancouver.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/first-time-homebuyers-liberal-announcement-1.5280751 Expansion of FTHBI by Liberals]</ref>\n\nUnder the FTHBI, a \"first time home buyer\" is anyone meeting the following criteria:\n* Either Canadian or permanent resident of Canada\n* At least 18 years old\n* The property should be used a principle residence within 9 months after the purchase of the property\n* Not owning any property anywhere in the world\n* The spouse or common-law partner of the buyer should not have owned a home during the period he/she was in the relationship with the buyer.\n\n==First Nations housing==\nThrough CMHC the Government of Canada provides funding each year to address housing needs in First Nation communities. CMHC's funding supports the construction of new rental housing, the renovation of existing homes, ongoing subsidies for existing rental social housing and an investment in capacity building for First Nations people living on-reserve.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_002.cfm|title=First Nation Housing {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020041807/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_002.cfm|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCMHC's On-Reserve Non-Profit Housing Program assists First Nations in the construction, purchase and rehabilitation, and administration of suitable, adequate and affordable rental housing in First Nations communities.

Previously the portfolio was held by the Minister of Employment and Social Development. The board of directors and president are appointed by the Government of Canada.\n\nAs Canada's national housing agency, CMHC contributes to the stability of the housing market and financial system, provides support to Canadians in housing need, and offers objective housing research and advice to Canadian governments, consumers and the housing industry.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CMHC headquarters Building A.jpg|thumb|CMHC headquarters, at [[Montreal Road]] and the [[Aviation Parkway (Ottawa)|Aviation Parkway]], [[Ottawa]]]]\nNear the end of [[World War II]], the Canadian government began to worry about the demobilization of thousands of soldiers in Europe, and their re-entrance to Canadian society.\n\nWith so many people coming back to Canada, a number of problems could arise, one being that there may not be enough housing existing to accommodate the soldiers and their families.\n\nAs such, on 1 January 1946 Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation was created (changed to \"Canada\" Mortgage and Housing Corporation in 1979) to house returning war veterans and to lead Canada's housing programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/index.cfm|title=History of CMHC {{!}} CHMC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909232847/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/index.cfm|archive-date=9 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCMHC's basic functions were to administer the ''National Housing Act'' and the ''Home Improvement Loans Guarantee Act'' and provide discounting facilities for loan and mortgage companies. The capital of the Corporation was set at $25 million (a substantial amount for the times), and a reserve fund of $5 million authorized to be accumulated from profits. This requirement and capital structure are still in effect today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/|title=History of CMHC {{!}} CHMC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910174447/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/|archive-date=10 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of the 1940s, the Government of Canada embarked on a program of much-needed social and rental housing, creating a federal-provincial public housing program for low-income families, with costs and subsidies shared 75% by the federal government and 25% by the province.\n\nIn 1947, CMHC took over the assets of Wartime Housing Ltd., another federal Crown corporation that had built thousands of rental housing units for war workers and veterans during the 6 years it was in operation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jill|first=Wade|date=1984-01-01|title=Wartime Housing Limited, 1941-1947 : an overview and evaluation of Canada's first national housing corporation|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0096317|doi=10.14288/1.0096317}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Ajax, Ontario, was constructed and operated by Wartime Housing Limited (1941 to 1949) in order to provide much-needed housing for munitions workers and returning veterans. In 1948, CMHC was given responsibility for Ajax. Its biggest challenges in establishing Ajax as a functioning municipality were reimbursing Pickering Township and Ontario County for municipal services provided to Ajax and establishing an official plan for the growing community acceptable to relevant government agencies. After considerable controversy regarding land and water control, CMHC submitted a successful application to the Ontario Municipal Board in May 1950 making Ajax an improvement district. This was the first step toward municipal status<!-- What does this mean?

Regent Park in Toronto is the first urban renewal project, where 42 acres (17&nbsp;ha) were cleared to build the 1056-unit, low-rent housing development in 1950. [[Habitations Jeanne-Mance]] in Montreal is another example. For further examples, see [[List of public housing projects in Canada]].\n\nIn 1951, CMHC started implementing the first of many federal-provincial public housing projects with 140 subsidized rent-to-income units in St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\nIn 1954, the federal government expanded the ''National Housing Act'' to allow chartered banks to enter the NHA lending field. CMHC introduced mortgage loan insurance, taking on mortgage risks with a 25% down payment, making home ownership more accessible to Canadians.\n\nThe banks thereafter began to issue mortgage loans with CMHC underwriting. If the individual receiving the loan went bankrupt then the bank who gave the loan would not lose money, but instead would be reimbursed by the government. As part of CMHC lending and insurance mechanisms, low-risk borrowers would have to pay insurance premiums if they wanted to borrow with small down payments.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CMHC built the first co-operative housing and, for the first time in Canadian history, multi-unit apartment buildings were beginning to outpace housing starts for single-family homes.\n\nThrough ongoing research with the building industry, CMHC raised Canadian housing standards to be among the best in the world. The construction of Habitat for Expo 67 in Montr\u00e9al led to many advances in materials and construction.\n\nIn 1967, CMHC published Canadian Wood Frame House Construction which became an on-site resource for small builders and trades. Preservation of historic neighbourhoods and downtown living became a priority and, in 1973, CMHC oversaw the transformation of Vancouver's Granville Island, a run-down industrial area, into a thriving centre for culture, recreation and tourism.\n\nIn 1974, CMHC introduced the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RRAP) to repair substandard homes to a minimum level of health and safety and to improve the accessibility of housing for disabled persons.\n\nDuring that decade, CMHC also turned its attention to Aboriginal and rural housing, introducing the Winter Warmth Assistance Program in 1971, the first of its kind to provide funds to Aboriginals for urgent repairs to housing in rural areas.\n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government withdrew from the financing of public housing projects. CMHC no longer directed funds to municipalities for the building of housing projects. Some government housing funds and mortgage guarantees since then have been provided for individual projects.\n\nThe 1990s introduced a new era of science and technology, including the development of FlexHousing\u2122, barrier-free housing, and Healthy Housing\u2122, a concept of energy efficiency and resource conservation in home construction.\n\nHowever, despite these advances, affordability remained a concern, particularly in the early 1990s as a result of the ongoing recession, layoffs and socio-economic uncertainty.\n\nCMHC created the Canadian Centre for Public-Private Partnerships in Housing in 1991, aimed at fostering public/private cooperation in housing projects.\n\nIn 1996, CMHC introduced \"emili\", an automated insurance underwriting system that moves application approval times from days to seconds\u2014making it easier for Canadian homebuyers to obtain mortgage loan insurance.\n\nIn 1999, the ''National Housing Act'' and the ''Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act'' were modified, allowing for the introduction of a 5% down payment\u2014a change launched as a pilot in 1992, extended and finalized in 1999\u2014removing a significant barrier for first-time home buyers. CMHC also expanded its activities internationally and launched the Canadian Housing Export Centre (later renamed CMHC International) to share Canada's housing expertise with the world.\n\nHousing affordability received a boost in 2001 through CMHC's introduction of Canada Mortgage Bonds, aimed at ensuring the supply of low-cost mortgage funding and keeping interest low.\n\nIn 2002, CMHC was recognized for its innovative work, receiving the Conference Board of Canada's National Award in Governance in the Public Sector, presented to boards of directors that have demonstrated excellence in governance and have implemented successful innovations in their governance practices.\n\nHomelessness, assisted housing and Aboriginal housing gained more prominence in the first half of the decade. In 2003, the federal-provincial affordable housing program began, with $1 billion in federal expenditure to improve affordable housing supply by an estimated 23,500 units.\n\nIn 2005, CMHC introduced a 10 per cent \"green refund\" on mortgage loan insurance premiums for homeowners who buy or build an energy-efficient home, or who make energy-saving renovations to their existing homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/moloin/moloin_008.cfm|title=CMHC \u2014 Energy-efficient Housing Made More Affordable with Mortgage Loan Insurance {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref>\n\nCMHC also introduced two on-reserve loan insurance products during the first half of the decade, enabling Band Councils or Aboriginal persons to access CMHC-insured financing for the construction, purchase or renovation of single-family homes or multiple residential properties, and an insurance pilot designed to increase market housing on-reserve.\n\n==Mortgage loan insurance==\nCMHC's mortgage loan insurance products facilitate access to a range of housing options for Canadians and promote and contribute to the stability of the financial system. CMHC's commercial operations contribute to improving the Government of Canada's fiscal position through its net income and income taxes paid.\n\nMortgage loan insurance is mandatory for federally regulated lenders in Canada when the buyer of a home has less than a 20 per cent down payment.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_004.cfm|title=Mortgage Loan Insurance {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020041015/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_004.cfm|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> This insurance protects the mortgage lender against loss if a borrower defaults, and allows qualified borrowers to access homeownership at interest rates comparable to those offered to buyers with larger down payments.\n\nAs a public mortgage insurer, CMHC has a mandate to provide service in all parts of the country and for a range of housing forms.<ref name=\":0\" /> A significant portion of CMHC's mortgage loan insurance business is in markets or for housing options that are not served or less served by private mortgage insurers. In addition to being the primary insurer for housing in small and rural communities, CMHC is the only insurer of mortgages for multi-unit residential properties, including large rental buildings, student housing and nursing and retirement homes.\n\n==Affordable housing==\nCMHC, on behalf of the Government of Canada, invests approximately $2 billion annually to help reduce the number of Canadians in housing need. This includes significant funding for social housing. Ongoing subsidies are provided under 25- to 50-year operating agreements with housing groups who provide affordable housing to those in need. Approximately 80 per cent of the existing social housing portfolio is administered by provinces and territories under long-term agreements with CMHC. The remaining 20 per cent is administered by CMHC and includes the on-reserve portfolio and certain federally funded housing units off-reserve, such as housing cooperatives.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_005.cfm|title=Affordable Housing {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020041700/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_005.cfm|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlso as part of the $2 billion annual investment, CMHC provides funding to provinces and territories under the Investment in Affordable Housing (IAH).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCMHC also supports affordable housing through low-cost loans to federally assisted social housing sponsors seeking to finance new projects on-reserve or to renew existing financing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCMHC's Affordable Housing Centre works with the private, public and non-profit sectors to help develop affordable housing that does not require ongoing federal assistance.\n\n==First-time home buyer incentive program==\n\nIn the [[2019 Canadian federal budget|2019 federal budget]], the Canadian government introduced the first-time home buyer incentive program (or FTHBI).<ref>[https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/nhs/canada-first-time-home-buyer-incentive First Time Home Buyer Incentive Program]</ref> The program, run via the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, is a form of [[equity sharing]] intended to help first time buyers with their down payments. The FTHBI allows eligible first-time home buyers to have 5% to 10% of their home down payment subsidized by the government as shared equity. Note that the program is unaffiliated with the Home Buyer Plan<ref>[https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/what-home-buyers-plan.html Home Buyers Plan]</ref> which allows buyers withdraw from their RRSP to increase their down payment. The program launched on September 2, 2019, but only covers purchases closing after November 1, 2019. The buyers must repay the government aid over a period of 15 years.\n\n'''FTHBI Eligibility:'''\nThis program can only be used for down payments below 15% (LTV > 85%). Eligible buyers must have a gross household income not exceeding $120,000.<ref>[https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/media-newsroom/news-releases/2019/federal-government-makes-easier-for-middle-class-canadians-buy-first-home-toronto Quick facts about the FTHBI]</ref> These, along with various other restrictions, limit the effective maximum price of an FTHBI-eligible property to $565,000.<ref>[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/6-things-to-know-about-trudeau-s-first-time-home-buyer-incentive-1.1309143 6 things to know about FTHBI]</ref>  This is far below the median property prices in population centers such as Toronto and Vancouver, leading to concerns regarding the efficacy of the program in these areas. During the federal election campaign of 2019, the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] promised to expand this program to better help buyers in Toronto and Vancouver.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/first-time-homebuyers-liberal-announcement-1.5280751 Expansion of FTHBI by Liberals]</ref>\n\nUnder the FTHBI, a \"first time home buyer\" is anyone meeting the following criteria:\n* Either Canadian or permanent resident of Canada\n* At least 18 years old\n* The property should be used a principle residence within 9 months after the purchase of the property\n* Not owning any property anywhere in the world\n* The spouse or common-law partner of the buyer should not have owned a home during the period he/she was in the relationship with the buyer.\n\n==First Nations housing==\nThrough CMHC the Government of Canada provides funding each year to address housing needs in First Nation communities. CMHC's funding supports the construction of new rental housing, the renovation of existing homes, ongoing subsidies for existing rental social housing and an investment in capacity building for First Nations people living on-reserve.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_002.cfm|title=First Nation Housing {{!}} CMHC|website=CMHC|access-date=2016-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020041807/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/whwedo/whwedo_002.cfm|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCMHC's On-Reserve Non-Profit Housing Program assists First Nations in the construction, purchase and rehabilitation, and administration of suitable, adequate and affordable rental housing in First Nations communities.
