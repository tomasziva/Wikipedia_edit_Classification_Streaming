They are the principal deterrent force against any aggression that could be shown against the sovereign state of Ukraine. All military and security forces, including the Armed Forces, are under the command of the [[President of Ukraine]], and subject to oversight by a permanent [[Verkhovna Rada]] parliamentary commission.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine are composed of the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces]], the [[Ukrainian Navy]], the [[Ukrainian Air Force]], and the [[Ukrainian Airmobile Forces]]. Ukraine's naval forces maintain their own small [[Ukrainian Naval Infantry]] force as well as their own [[Ukrainian Naval Aviation]] force. The [[Ukrainian Sea Guard]] is the coast guard service of Ukraine, however, it is part of the [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine]] and is not subordinate to the Navy. As a result of the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine]] from 2014, the president commissioned governors of [[oblasts of Ukraine]] to create volunteer [[Territorial Defense Battalion of Ukraine|units]] under the government program \"Territorial Defense\". Initially these units received minimal funding coming from regional budgets and mostly relied on donations. In November 2014 most of the territorial battalions were integrated into Ukraine's Ground forces.\n\nThe [[National Guard of Ukraine]] serves as the main reserve component of Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nDue to the ongoing hostilities with Russia, Ukraine has greatly increased the size of its military forces to 204,000 soldiers (+46,000 civil servants) in 2014, not counting paramilitary forces such as the border guards (53,000), the newly formed National Guard of Ukraine (60,000) or the security service.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-plans-to-double-military-budget-against-fighting-in-east/a-18125986 |title = Ukraine plans to double military budget against fighting in east |date=12 December 2014|work = [[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date = 9 February 2016|via = |archive-date = 9 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160209210320/http://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-plans-to-double-military-budget-against-fighting-in-east/a-18125986}}</ref> The size Ukraine's armed forces came close to France, which maintained a 229,000 man force, as the largest in Europe when excluding Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=france|publisher=Global Fire Power|title=France|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229115238/http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=france|archive-date=2014-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> It was reported that Ukraine's military swelled to 280,000 personnel.

Like other Soviet republics, it did not possess its own separate military command, as all military formations were uniformly subordinated to the central command of the [[Armed Forces of the USSR]]. Administratively, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] was divided into three Soviet military districts (the [[Carpathian Military District]], [[Kiev]] [[Kiev Military District|Military District]], and [[Odesa]] [[Odessa Military District|Military District]]). Three Soviet air commands and most of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] naval bases were located on the coast of Ukraine.\n\nWhen the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] took place in 1991 (see [[Novo-Ogaryovo]] process), the newly-independent state of Ukraine inherited one of the most powerful force groupings in Europe. According to an associate of the [[Conflict Studies Research Centre]], James Sherr: \"This grouping, its inventory of equipment and its officer corps was designed for one purpose: to wage combined arms, coalition, offensive (and nuclear) warfare against NATO on an external front\".<ref>James Sherr, 'Ukraine's Defense Reform: An Update', [[Conflict Studies Research Centre]], 2002</ref> At that time, the former Soviet armed forces in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] included a rocket army ([[43rd Rocket Army]]), four air-force armies, an air-defense army ([[8th Air Defence Army]]), three regular armies, two tank armies, the [[32nd Army Corps (Soviet Union)|32nd Army Corps]], and the [[Black Sea Fleet]].<ref>[http://vijsko.milua.org/i4.htm \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0417\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0421\u0438\u043b \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f (Status of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the time of creation)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531092727/http://vijsko.milua.org/i4.htm |date=2012-05-31 }}.

Among these were the definition, agreement, and ratification of the 1990 [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE) which not only established the maximum level of armament for each republic of the former USSR, but also a special ceiling for the so-called CFE \"Flank Region\". Included in this region were Ukraine's [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] and [[Zaporizhia Oblast]]s, and the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]]. Another key event in the development of the Ukrainian military was the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|1992 Tashkent Treaty]], which laid out aspirations for a [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] military.

veterans with a range of benefits. Ukrainians who served in WWII, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], or as [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidators]] at the [[Chernobyl disaster]] are eligible for benefits such as monthly allowances, discounts on medical and pharmacy services, free use of public transportation, additional vacation days from work, retention priority in work layoffs, easier access to loans and associated approval processes, preference when applying for security related positions, priority when applying to vocational schools or trade schools, and electricity, gas, and housing subsidies. Veterans are also eligible to stay at military sanatoriums, space permitting. Since gaining independence, Ukraine has deployed troops to Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, gaining a new generation of veterans separate from those who have served in the Soviet forces. Most recently, the government passed a law extending veteran benefits to Ukrainian troops responding to the [[War in Donbass]]. Moreover, veterans from other nations who move to or reside in Ukraine may be eligible for some of the listed benefits, this provision was likely made to ensure WWII, Chernobyl, and Afghanistan veterans from other Soviet states who moved to Ukraine received similar benefits, however as Ukraine has participated in numerous NATO-led conflicts since its independence, it is unclear if NATO veterans would be extended these benefits.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timlawyer.com.ua/lgoti-voenoslugashim-uchastnikam-ato/|title=Benefits for the servicemen of the ATO|publisher=\u0425\u0430\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0422\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0432|date=2014-09-08|access-date=2014-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009145108/http://timlawyer.com.ua/lgoti-voenoslugashim-uchastnikam-ato|archive-date=2014-10-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVeteran groups are not as developed as in the United States which has numerous well known national organizations such as the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. World War II veterans, and even persons who have lived through the war are generally treated with the highest respect. Other veterans are not as well known. Ukrainian veterans from the Soviet War of Afghanistan are strikingly similar to the Vietnam veterans of the United States. The Soviet Union generally kept the public in the dark through the war, unlike in Vietnam where coverage was very high, Afghanistan is often labeled as a mistake by the Soviet Union and its successor states, the lack of media coverage and censorship through the war also ensured that many still remain unaware of their nations involvement in the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=61&print=yes|title=Afghanistan Veteran Once Removed|website=vvaw.org|publisher=Vietnam Veterans Against the War|access-date=2016-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003643/http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=61&print=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite Ukraine having the 3rd largest contingent of troops in Iraq in 2004, few also realize that their nation has many veterans of the Iraq war.\n\nDue to the ongoing conflict with pro-Russian separatists, another generation of veterans appeared in Ukraine. These veterans would be eligible for the same benefits as all others. However, as there was no official declaration of war it was difficult to determine the cut-off date for veteran benefits, leaving many that participated at the beginning of the conflict without benefits. At first, Ukraine only gave benefits posthumously to family members as there was no legal framework to account for the veterans, moreover, members of territorial defense battalions were not eligible for benefits at all. In August, a law was passed granting all service members participating in Ukraine's Anti-Terror Operation the status of veterans, five months after first hostilities broke out in Crimea, the territorial defense battalions were integrated into the National Guard making them part of Ukraine's forces, thus allowing their volunteers to receive veteran status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://censor.net.ua/news/305860/status_uchastnika_boevyh_deyistviyi_boyitsy_ato_poka_poluchayut_tolko_posmertno|publisher=censor|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0439\u0446\u044b \u0410\u0422\u041e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010004717/http://censor.net.ua/news/305860/status_uchastnika_boevyh_deyistviyi_boyitsy_ato_poka_poluchayut_tolko_posmertno|archive-date=2014-10-10|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.zn.ua/internal/uchastnik-boevyh-deystviy-nerealnaya-mechta-uchastnika-ato-_.html|publisher=Gazaeta|title=\u0423\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439. \u041d\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0410\u0422\u041e|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111113053/http://gazeta.zn.ua/internal/uchastnik-boevyh-deystviy-nerealnaya-mechta-uchastnika-ato-_.html|archive-date=2015-01-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVeterans of the so-called \"ATO\"-operations in Donbas are eligible for receiving apartments (if staying in active duty) or a land plot for building purposes of 1000 sqm. in the district of their registration.\n\nOn 22 November 2018 the [[Ministry for Veterans Affairs]] of Ukraine was officially established.<ref name=\"UGF10145168MVA\">[https://www.unian.info/m/politics/10348734-ukraine-parliament-appoints-markarova-friz-ministers.html Ukraine parliament appoints Markarova, Friz ministers], [[UNIAN]] (22 November 2018)</ref>\n\n== Military industrial complex ==\n{{Main|Ukroboronprom}}\n\nUkraine received about 30% of the [[Soviet military]] industry, which included between 50 and 60 percent of all Ukrainian [[Company|enterprises]], employing 40% of its working population.

They are the principal deterrent force against any aggression that could be shown against the sovereign state of Ukraine. All military and security forces, including the Armed Forces, are under the command of the [[President of Ukraine]], and subject to oversight by a permanent [[Verkhovna Rada]] parliamentary commission.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine are composed of the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces]], the [[Ukrainian Navy]], the [[Ukrainian Air Force]], and the [[Ukrainian Airmobile Forces]]. Ukraine's naval forces maintain their own small [[Ukrainian Naval Infantry]] force as well as their own [[Ukrainian Naval Aviation]] force. The [[Ukrainian Sea Guard]] is the coast guard service of Ukraine, however, it is part of the [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine]] and is not subordinate to the Navy. As a result of the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine]] from 2014, the president commissioned governors of [[oblasts of Ukraine]] to create volunteer [[Territorial Defense Battalion of Ukraine|units]] under the government program \"Territorial Defense\". Initially these units received minimal funding coming from regional budgets and mostly relied on donations. In November 2014 most of the territorial battalions were integrated into Ukraine's Ground forces.\n\nThe [[National Guard of Ukraine]] serves as the main reserve component of Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nDue to the ongoing hostilities with Russia, Ukraine has greatly increased the size of its military forces to 204,000 soldiers (+46,000 civil servants) in 2014, not counting paramilitary forces such as the border guards (53,000), the newly formed National Guard of Ukraine (60,000) or the security service.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-plans-to-double-military-budget-against-fighting-in-east/a-18125986 |title = Ukraine plans to double military budget against fighting in east |date=12 December 2014|work = [[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date = 9 February 2016|via = |archive-date = 9 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160209210320/http://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-plans-to-double-military-budget-against-fighting-in-east/a-18125986}}</ref> The size Ukraine's armed forces came close to France, which maintained a 229,000 man force, as the largest in Europe when excluding Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=france|publisher=Global Fire Power|title=France|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229115238/http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=france|archive-date=2014-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> It was reported that Ukraine's military swelled to 280,000 personnel.

Like other Soviet republics, it did not possess its own separate military command, as all military formations were uniformly subordinated to the central command of the [[Armed Forces of the USSR]]. Administratively, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] was divided into three Soviet military districts (the [[Carpathian Military District]], [[Kiev]] [[Kiev Military District|Military District]], and [[Odesa]] [[Odessa Military District|Military District]]). Three Soviet air commands and most of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] naval bases were located on the coast of Ukraine.\n\nWhen the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] took place in 1991 (see [[Novo-Ogaryovo]] process), the newly-independent state of Ukraine inherited one of the most powerful force groupings in Europe. According to an associate of the [[Conflict Studies Research Centre]], James Sherr: \"This grouping, its inventory of equipment and its officer corps was designed for one purpose: to wage combined arms, coalition, offensive (and nuclear) warfare against NATO on an external front\".<ref>James Sherr, 'Ukraine's Defense Reform: An Update', [[Conflict Studies Research Centre]], 2002</ref> At that time, the former Soviet armed forces in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] included a rocket army ([[43rd Rocket Army]]), four air-force armies, an air-defense army ([[8th Air Defence Army]]), three regular armies, two tank armies, the [[32nd Army Corps (Soviet Union)|32nd Army Corps]], and the [[Black Sea Fleet]].<ref>[http://vijsko.milua.org/i4.htm \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0417\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0421\u0438\u043b \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f (Status of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the time of creation)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531092727/http://vijsko.milua.org/i4.htm |date=2012-05-31 }}.

Along with their equipment and personnel, Ukraine's armed forces inherited the battle honors and lineage of the Soviet forces stationed in Ukraine.

Among these were the definition, agreement, and ratification of the 1990 [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE) which not only established the maximum level of armament for each republic of the former USSR, but also a special ceiling for the so-called CFE \"Flank Region\". Included in this region were Ukraine's [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] and [[Zaporizhia Oblast]]s, and the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]]. Another key event in the development of the Ukrainian military was the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|1992 Tashkent Treaty]], which laid out aspirations for a [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] military.

Under former President Yushchenko, Ukraine pursued a policy of independence from Russian dominance, and thus tried to fully integrate with the West, specifically NATO.\n\nUntil the Euromaidan crisis of 2014, Ukraine retained tight military relations with [[Russia]], inherited from their common Soviet history. Common uses for naval bases in the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]] and joint [[air defense]] efforts were the most intense cooperative efforts. This cooperation was a permanent irritant in bilateral relations, but Ukraine appeared economically dependent on Moscow, and thus unable to break such ties quickly.

veterans with a range of benefits. Ukrainians who served in WWII, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], or as [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidators]] at the [[Chernobyl disaster]] are eligible for benefits such as monthly allowances, discounts on medical and pharmacy services, free use of public transportation, additional vacation days from work, retention priority in work layoffs, easier access to loans and associated approval processes, preference when applying for security related positions, priority when applying to vocational schools or trade schools, and electricity, gas, and housing subsidies. Veterans are also eligible to stay at military sanatoriums, space permitting. Since gaining independence, Ukraine has deployed troops to Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, gaining a new generation of veterans separate from those who have served in the Soviet forces. Most recently, the government passed a law extending veteran benefits to Ukrainian troops responding to the [[War in Donbass]]. Moreover, veterans from other nations who move to or reside in Ukraine may be eligible for some of the listed benefits, this provision was likely made to ensure WWII, Chernobyl, and Afghanistan veterans from other Soviet states who moved to Ukraine received similar benefits, however as Ukraine has participated in numerous NATO-led conflicts since its independence, it is unclear if NATO veterans would be extended these benefits.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timlawyer.com.ua/lgoti-voenoslugashim-uchastnikam-ato/|title=Benefits for the servicemen of the ATO|publisher=\u0425\u0430\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0422\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0432|date=2014-09-08|access-date=2014-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009145108/http://timlawyer.com.ua/lgoti-voenoslugashim-uchastnikam-ato|archive-date=2014-10-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVeteran groups are not as developed as in the United States which has numerous well known national organizations such as the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. World War II veterans, and even persons who have lived through the war are generally treated with the highest respect. Other veterans are not as well known. Ukrainian veterans from the Soviet War of Afghanistan are strikingly similar to the Vietnam veterans of the United States. The Soviet Union generally kept the public in the dark through the war, unlike in Vietnam where coverage was very high, Afghanistan is often labeled as a mistake by the Soviet Union and its successor states, the lack of media coverage and censorship through the war also ensured that many still remain unaware of their nations involvement in the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=61&print=yes|title=Afghanistan Veteran Once Removed|website=vvaw.org|publisher=Vietnam Veterans Against the War|access-date=2016-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003643/http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=61&print=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite Ukraine having the 3rd largest contingent of troops in Iraq in 2004, few also realize that their nation has many veterans of the Iraq war.\n\nDue to the ongoing conflict with pro-Russian separatists, another generation of veterans appeared in Ukraine. These veterans would be eligible for the same benefits as all others. However, as there was no official declaration of war it was difficult to determine the cut-off date for veteran benefits, leaving many that participated at the beginning of the conflict without benefits. At first, Ukraine only gave benefits posthumously to family members as there was no legal framework to account for the veterans, moreover, members of territorial defense battalions were not eligible for benefits at all. In August, a law was passed granting all service members participating in Ukraine's Anti-Terror Operation the status of veterans, five months after first hostilities broke out in Crimea, the territorial defense battalions were integrated into the National Guard making them part of Ukraine's forces, thus allowing their volunteers to receive veteran status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://censor.net.ua/news/305860/status_uchastnika_boevyh_deyistviyi_boyitsy_ato_poka_poluchayut_tolko_posmertno|publisher=censor|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0439\u0446\u044b \u0410\u0422\u041e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010004717/http://censor.net.ua/news/305860/status_uchastnika_boevyh_deyistviyi_boyitsy_ato_poka_poluchayut_tolko_posmertno|archive-date=2014-10-10|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.zn.ua/internal/uchastnik-boevyh-deystviy-nerealnaya-mechta-uchastnika-ato-_.html|publisher=Gazaeta|title=\u0423\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439. \u041d\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0410\u0422\u041e|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111113053/http://gazeta.zn.ua/internal/uchastnik-boevyh-deystviy-nerealnaya-mechta-uchastnika-ato-_.html|archive-date=2015-01-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nVeterans of the so-called \"ATO\"-operations in Donbas are eligible for receiving apartments (if staying in active duty) or a land plot for building purposes of 1000 sqm. in the district of their registration.\n\nOn 22 November 2018 the [[Ministry for Veterans Affairs]] of Ukraine was officially established.<ref name=\"UGF10145168MVA\">[https://www.unian.info/m/politics/10348734-ukraine-parliament-appoints-markarova-friz-ministers.html Ukraine parliament appoints Markarova, Friz ministers], [[UNIAN]] (22 November 2018)</ref>\n\n== Military industrial complex ==\n{{Main|Ukroboronprom}}\n\nUkraine received about 30% of the [[Soviet military]] industry, which included between 50 and 60 percent of all Ukrainian [[Company|enterprises]], employing 40% of its working population.
