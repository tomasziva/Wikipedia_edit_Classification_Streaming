Because of this, some folk song fans criticized them for watering down their beliefs and commercializing their singing style. But the Weavers felt it was worth it to get their songs before the public, and to avoid the explicit type of commitment which had led to the demise of the Almanacs. The new approach proved a success, leading to many bookings and increased demand for the group's recordings.\n\nThe successful concerts and hit recordings of the Weavers helped introduce to new audiences such folk revival standards as \"[[On Top of Old Smoky]]\"<ref name=pc1/> (with guest vocalist [[Terry Gilkyson]]), \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", \"[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine (song)|Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]\", \"The Wreck of the John B\" (aka \"[[The John B.

Right-wing and anti-Communist groups protested at their performances and harassed promoters. As a result, the group's economic viability diminished rapidly and in 1952 it disbanded.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After this, Pete Seeger continued his solo career, although as with all of them, he continued to suffer from the effects of blacklisting.\n\n===Reformed===\nIn December 1955, the group reunited to play a sold-out concert at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The concert was a huge success. A recording of the concert, [[The Weavers at Carnegie Hall]], was issued by the independent [[Vanguard Records]], and this led to their signing by that record label. By the late 1950s, folk music was surging in popularity and McCarthyism was fading. Yet it was not until the height of the 1960s that Seeger was able to end his blacklisting by appearing on the nationally broadcast CBS-TV variety show, ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', in 1967.<ref>Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, by David Bianculli, Touchstone, 2009.</ref>\n\nAfter the April 1957 LP release of the Carnegie Hall concert, the Weavers launched a month-long concert tour. That August, the group reassembled for a series of recording sessions for Vanguard. As Seeger's college concert bookings grew, the singer felt restricted by his obligations to the group. Vanguard booked the Weavers for a January 15, 1958, session to record a [[rock-and-roll]] single. The results were embarrassing and fueled Seeger's frustration. The following month Gilbert, Hays, and Hellerman overruled Seeger about recording a cigarette ad for a tobacco company. Seeger, opposed to the dangers of tobacco and discouraged by the group's apparent sell-out to commercial interests, decided to resign. Honoring his commitment to record the jingle, he left the group on March 3, 1958.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nSeeger recommended [[Erik Darling]] of [[The Tarriers]] as his replacement.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Darling remained with the group until June 1962, leaving to pursue a solo career and eventually to form the folk-jazz trio [[The Rooftop Singers]]. [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], who replaced Darling, stayed with the group nine months, giving his notice just before the Weavers celebrated the group's fifteenth anniversary with two nights of concerts at Carnegie Hall in March 1963.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Folksinger [[Bernie Krause]], later a pioneer in bringing the [[Moog synthesizer]] to popular music, was the last performer to occupy \"the Seeger chair.\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The group disbanded in 1964, but Gilbert, Hellerman, and Hays occasionally reunited with Seeger during the next 16 years. In 1980, Lee Hays, ill and using a wheelchair, wistfully approached the original Weavers for one last get-together. Hays' informal picnic prompted a professional reunion, and a triumphant return to Carnegie Hall on November 28, 1980, which was to be the band's last full performance. They appeared one final time in June 1981 at the [[Clearwater Festival]], in an informal \"rehearsal.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blau|first1=Eleanor|title=WEAVERS TO BE REUNITED AT HUDSON RIVER REVIVAL|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/arts/weavers-to-be-reunited-at-hudson-river-revival.html|accessdate=25 April 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=June 19, 1981}}</ref>\n\n==Music style==\nIn a 1968 interview, in response to claims that record companies found the Weavers difficult to classify, Seeger told the ''[[Pop Chronicles]]'' music documentary to \"leave that up to the anthropologists, the folklorists. ...For you and me, the important thing is a song, a good song, a true song. ...Call it anything you want.\"<ref name=pc1/><ref>{{Gilliland |https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153027/http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/o-s|O-S interview index}}</ref> \n\nA [[Documentary film|documentary]] film, ''[[The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time!]]'' (1982), was released after the death of Hays, and chronicled the history of the group, and the events leading up to the reunion.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars out of a possible four in his ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review and named it one of his Top 10 films for 1982.\n\n==After disbanding==\nFollowing the dissolution of the band, Ronnie Gilbert toured America as a soloist and Fred Hellerman worked as a recording engineer and producer. The group was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001.\n\nIn February 2006, The Weavers received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Represented by members Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, they struck a chord with the crowd as their struggles with political witch hunts during the 1950s were recounted. \"If you can exist, and stay the course \u2013 not a course of blind obstinacy and faulty conception \u2013 but one of decency and good sense, you can outlast your enemies with your honor and integrity intact,\" Hellerman said. Some commentators see the reference to \"blind obstinacy\" as a veiled criticism of those who believed blindly in all the actions of the communist party.\n\nLee Hays died in 1981, aged 67, and his biography, ''Lonesome Traveler'' by Doris Willens, was published in 1988.<ref>Willens, D.

Seeger was found guilty of contempt and placed under restrictions by the court pending appeal, but in 1961 his conviction was overturned on technical grounds.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LnORWrmvlloC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lee+Hays&ei=5yZhS4zOEZDMywSsx8UW&client=firefox-a&cd=7#v=onepage&q=Committee&f=false ''\"Sing out, warning! sing out, love!\": the writings of Lee Hays]'', by Lee Hays and Steven Koppelman (Amherst and Boston: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2003), p. 116.</ref> Because Seeger was among those listed in the entertainment industry [[blacklist]] publication, [[Red Channels]], all of the Weavers were placed under FBI surveillance and not allowed to perform on television or radio during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era.

Right-wing and anti-Communist groups protested at their performances and harassed promoters. As a result, the group's economic viability diminished rapidly and in 1952 it disbanded.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After this, Pete Seeger continued his solo career, although as with all of them, he continued to suffer from the effects of blacklisting.\n\n===Reformed===\nIn December 1955, the group reunited to play a sold-out concert at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The concert was a huge success. A recording of the concert, [[The Weavers at Carnegie Hall]], was issued by the independent [[Vanguard Records]], and this led to their signing by that record label. By the late 1950s, folk music was surging in popularity and McCarthyism was fading. Yet it was not until the height of the 1960s that Seeger was able to end his blacklisting by appearing on the nationally broadcast CBS-TV variety show, ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', in 1967.<ref>Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, by David Bianculli, Touchstone, 2009.</ref>\n\nAfter the April 1957 LP release of the Carnegie Hall concert, the Weavers launched a month-long concert tour. That August, the group reassembled for a series of recording sessions for Vanguard. As Seeger's college concert bookings grew, the singer felt restricted by his obligations to the group. Vanguard booked the Weavers for a January 15, 1958, session to record a [[rock-and-roll]] single. The results were embarrassing and fueled Seeger's frustration. The following month Gilbert, Hays, and Hellerman overruled Seeger about recording a cigarette ad for a tobacco company. Seeger, opposed to the dangers of tobacco and discouraged by the group's apparent sell-out to commercial interests, decided to resign. Honoring his commitment to record the jingle, he left the group on March 3, 1958.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nSeeger recommended [[Erik Darling]] of [[The Tarriers]] as his replacement.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Darling remained with the group until June 1962, leaving to pursue a solo career and eventually to form the folk-jazz trio [[The Rooftop Singers]]. [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], who replaced Darling, stayed with the group nine months, giving his notice just before the Weavers celebrated the group's fifteenth anniversary with two nights of concerts at Carnegie Hall in March 1963.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Folksinger [[Bernie Krause]], later a pioneer in bringing the [[Moog synthesizer]] to popular music, was the last performer to occupy \"the Seeger chair.\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The group disbanded in 1964, but Gilbert, Hellerman, and Hays occasionally reunited with Seeger during the next 16 years. In 1980, Lee Hays, ill and using a wheelchair, wistfully approached the original Weavers for one last get-together. Hays' informal picnic prompted a professional reunion, and a triumphant return to Carnegie Hall on November 28, 1980, which was to be the band's last full performance. They appeared one final time in June 1981 at the [[Clearwater Festival]], in an informal \"rehearsal.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blau|first1=Eleanor|title=WEAVERS TO BE REUNITED AT HUDSON RIVER REVIVAL|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/arts/weavers-to-be-reunited-at-hudson-river-revival.html|accessdate=25 April 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=June 19, 1981}}</ref>\n\n==Music style==\nIn a 1968 interview, in response to claims that record companies found the Weavers difficult to classify, Seeger told the ''[[Pop Chronicles]]'' music documentary to \"leave that up to the anthropologists, the folklorists. ...For you and me, the important thing is a song, a good song, a true song. ...Call it anything you want.\"<ref name=pc1/><ref>{{Gilliland |https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153027/http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/o-s|O-S interview index}}</ref> \n\nA [[Documentary film|documentary]] film, ''[[The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time!]]'' (1982), was released after the death of Hays, and chronicled the history of the group, and the events leading up to the reunion.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars out of a possible four in his ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review and named it one of his Top 10 films for 1982.\n\n==After disbanding==\nFollowing the dissolution of the band, Ronnie Gilbert toured America as a soloist and Fred Hellerman worked as a recording engineer and producer. The group was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001.\n\nIn February 2006, The Weavers received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Represented by members Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, they struck a chord with the crowd as their struggles with political witch hunts during the 1950s were recounted. \"If you can exist, and stay the course \u2013 not a course of blind obstinacy and faulty conception \u2013 but one of decency and good sense, you can outlast your enemies with your honor and integrity intact,\" Hellerman said. Some commentators see the reference to \"blind obstinacy\" as a veiled criticism of those who believed blindly in all the actions of the communist party.\n\nLee Hays died in 1981, aged 67, and his biography, ''Lonesome Traveler'' by Doris Willens, was published in 1988.<ref>Willens, D.
