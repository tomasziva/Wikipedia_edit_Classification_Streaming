At the same time, viruses have co-evolved evasion machinery to address the many ways that host organisms attempt to eradicate them. DNA and RNA viruses use complex methods to evade immune cell detection through disruption of the Interferon Signaling Pathway, remodeling of cellular architecture, targeted gene silencing, and recognition protein cleavage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyman|first=Harvard|date=September 2003|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell: A Problems Approach.

By utilizing architectural rearrangement of the membrane, viruses have developed a method to evade cytoplasm localized pattern recognition proteins such as RIG-I. In order to evade pattern recognition, other viruses such as Enterovirus have evolved multi-functional proteins that not only help in viral protein processing but also cleave cytoplasmic recognition proteins MDA5 and RIG-I, further demonstrating the extent to which viruses can reduce Interferon Signaling through various pathways.
