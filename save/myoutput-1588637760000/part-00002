These three broad categories are each divided further to reflect more specific types of violence:\n* physical\n* sexual\n* psychological\n* emotional\n\nAlternatively, violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915221238/http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-15 }}</ref>\n\n=== Self-directed violence ===\nSelf-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and [[Self-harm|self-abuse]]. The former includes [[suicidal thoughts]], [[attempted suicide]]s \u2013 also called ''[[para suicide]]'' or ''deliberate self-injury'' in some countries \u2013 and completed suicides.

Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups. Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain \u2013 such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J137v04n02_03|title=Poverty as a Form of Violence|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=4|issue=2\u20133|pages=45\u201359|year=2001|last1=Allen|first1=Josephine A.

Victims can have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits, the cost of which quickly add up. Since the victims of youth-on-youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them, including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills. Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain. \"Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 |accessdate=November 24, 2018 }}</ref> Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). \"Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems.

By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they've experienced, negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated. As an initial step, the youths need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently. Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced. \u201cNeuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves\u201d.<ref name=\"The Body Keeps The Score\">{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 |accessdate=December 2, 2018 }}</ref> \n \nSome of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and other actions that enable youths to release their pent up emotions.

Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort. Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance. In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, it has been recommended that schools offer mentoring programs where students can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them. Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session.

School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research.

Its causes are complex and occur at different levels. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or [[social ecological model]] is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:\n\nThe first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), [[Genetics of aggression|genetics]], [[brain lesion theory|brain lesions]], [[personality disorders]], [[substance abuse]], and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.<ref name=Patrick>{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = C.

In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person's risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In [[elder abuse]], important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.\n\nThe third level explores the community context\u2014i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.\n\nFinally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, [[income inequality]], the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.\n\n=== Child-rearing ===\nWhile studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373\u20131377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}</ref> Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of [[corporal punishment]] of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies.

[[Neuroscientist|Neurobiologist]] Jan Vodka emphasizes that, for those purposes, \"violent behavior is defined as overt and intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person.\"<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127111237/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/307.pdf The Neurobiology of Violence, An Update], Journal of Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 11:3, Summer 1999. As Mexican Biologist and Scientologist Adri Rodriguez says, Violence is a recurring motif in today's society.</ref>\n\nBased on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans.

For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as \"violent\", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.<ref>{{cite book | last = Rowan | first = John | year = 1978 | title = The Structured Crowd | publisher = Davis-Poynter. | title-link = The Structured Crowd }}</ref>\n\nThe \"violent male ape\" image is often brought up in discussions of human violence.

Ury, editor of a book called \"We Must Fight! From the Battlefield to the Schoolyard\u2014A New Perspective on Violent Conflict and Its Prevention\" criticizes the \"killer ape\" myth in his book which brings together discussions from two Harvard Law School symposiums.

The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to \"do justice\", i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.<ref>M. Moore \"Public Health and Criminal Justice Approaches to Prevention.\"1992. In Vol. 16 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, edited by M. Tonry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref>\n\nThe criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes \u2013 through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3938be88dc32dacf1e139dc19639d332fd956bc| journal = Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 82\u201394 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x| pmid = 15152429 }}</ref>\n\nIn recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and [[problem-oriented policing]] aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it \u2013 and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.<ref>Bratton W (with Knobler P). Turnaround: how America's top cop reversed the crime epidemic. New York: Random House, 1998</ref> Juvenile justice systems \u2013 an important component of criminal justice systems \u2013 are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the \"Blueprints for violence prevention\" programme at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].<ref>Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence [http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints \"Blueprints for violence prevention/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103080341/http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/ |date=2012-01-03 }}</ref>\n\n=== Public health ===\nThe public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.<ref name=\"who.int\" /> Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely \"criminal\" or \"medical\" problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the [[Social ecological model]].\n\nFrom a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:\n* Primary prevention \u2013 approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.\n* Secondary prevention \u2013 approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.\n* Tertiary prevention \u2013 approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.\n\nA public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible \"symptoms\". This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.\n\nThe public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:\n# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.\n# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.\n# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.\n# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.\n\nIn many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.<ref>Gordon JE, \"The epidemiology of accidents,\" ''American Journal of Public Health'', 1949; 504\u201315.</ref> In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to \"extending life\" or to a \"complete state of well-being\". He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Abad Gomez H | year = 1962 | title = Violence requires epidemiological studies | url = | journal = Tribuna Medica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1\u201312 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dahlberg L. |author2=Mercy J. | year = 2009 | title = History of violence as a public health issue | url = | journal = Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 167\u2013172 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.2.mhst1-0902|pmid=23190546 }}</ref> This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.\n\nThe global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25<ref>[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf \"WHA49.25 Prevention of violence: a public health priority\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }}</ref> which declared violence \"a leading worldwide public health problem\" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).<ref name=\"who.int\" />\n\nThe case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3938be88dc32dacf1e139dc19639d332fd956bc| journal = Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82\u201388 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x| pmid = 15152429 }}</ref> First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places \u2013 which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries \u2013 than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse \u2013 which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.\n\n=== Human rights ===\n[[File:Abdulredha Buhmaid on floor.jpeg|thumb|[[Bahrain]]'s pro-democracy protesters killed by military, February 2011]]\nThe [[human rights]] approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, [[autonomy]] and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to [[privacy]]; and the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]. These human rights are enshrined in [[international human rights law|international and regional treaties]] and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.\n\n=== Geographical context ===\nViolence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, \"appears whenever power is in jeopardy\" and \"in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles\".<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\">Hyndman, J. (2009) Violence in Gregory, D., Johnston, R., Pratt, G., Watts, M. and Whatmore, S. eds. Dictionary of Human Geography, Wiley-Blackwell, NJ: 798-799.</ref> Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories \u2013 direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that \"geography came late to theorizing violence\"<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.<ref>Bowlby, S. (2001) Social Geography, in Smelser, N. and Baltes, P. eds. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Oxford, Elsevier, 14293-14299.</ref>\nAlong with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.\n\nDerek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection ''Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence'', which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.<ref>Gregory, Derek and Pred, Alan'', 2006 Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence''. London: Routledge.</ref> Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When \"modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law\",<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s concepts of [[state of exception]] and ''[[homo sacer]]'' are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this \"in limbo\" reality is designed to be in place \"until further notice\u2026the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself\".<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\">Agamben, G. (1998) ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press, Stanford.</ref> For Agamben, the physical space of the camp \"is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space\".<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\" /> At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by \"juridical procedures and deployments of power\"<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\" /> that \"no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime\";<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\" /> in other words, people become only ''homo sacer''. [[Guantanamo Bay]] could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.\n\nIn the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]] resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\">Ringer, G. (2002) \"Killing Fields\", in Christensen, K. and Levinson, D. eds. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York: 368-370.</ref> About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at [[Choeung Ek]], which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the [[Killing Fields]].<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made ''homo sacer'' in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields\u2014manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law\u2014featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's \"ideological intent\u2026to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative\",<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> he \"dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area\".<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When \"symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind\u2026were purged or torn down\",<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> cultural violence (defined as when \"any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence\"<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" />) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.\n\nHuman geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, [[Adriana Cavarero]] notes that, \"as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language\".<ref name=\"Cavarero, A. 2009\">Cavarero, A. (2009) ''Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence'', Columbia University Press, New York.</ref> Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as \"horrorism\"; that is, \"as though ideally all the\u2026victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name\".<ref name=\"Cavarero, A. 2009\" /> With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}\n\n== Epidemiology ==\n[[File:No Violence Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign that calls to stop violence]]\nAs of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095\u2013128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=SY|last11=Alvarado|first11=M|last12=Anderson|first12=HR|last13=Anderson|first13=LM|last14=Andrews|first14=KG|last15=Atkinson|first15=C|last16=Baddour|first16=LM|last17=Barker-Collo|first17=S|last18=Bartels|first18=DH|last19=Bell|first19=ML|last20=Benjamin|first20=EJ|last21=Bennett|first21=D|last22=Bhalla|first22=K|last23=Bikbov|first23=B|last24=Bin Abdulhak|first24=A|last25=Birbeck|first25=G|last26=Blyth|first26=F|last27=Bolliger|first27=I|last28=Boufous|first28=S|last29=Bucello|first29=C|last30=Burch|first30=M|last2=Naghavi|display-authors=29|url=http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30050819/ortblad-globalandregional-2012.pdf|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819}}</ref> [[Suicide]] accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.<ref name=Loz2012 /> Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.<ref name=Loz2012 />\n\nBy way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).<ref>[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html \"Global Burden of Disease, Disease and injury regional estimates\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.</ref>\n\nFor every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries.

This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence.

A few centuries ago, for example, [[genocide]] was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it. [[Cannibalism]] and [[slavery]] have been greatly reduced in the last thousand years, and [[capital punishment]] is now banned in many countries. According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century.<ref name=Pinker>{{cite book |author=Steven Pinker |title=The Better Angels of Our Nature |isbn=978-0-670-02295-3 |year=2011 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/betterangelsofou00pink |author-link=Steven Pinker }}</ref> However, Pinker's analyses have met with much criticism, mainly concerning the statistical question of how to measure violence and whether it is in fact declining.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |title=Book Review |author=R Epstein |magazine=Scientific American |date=October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914140139/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |archivedate=2016-09-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"Laws\">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |title=Against Pinker's Violence |first=Ben |last=Laws |journal=[[Ctheory]] |date=21 March 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052358/http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |archivedate=12 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |title=The Big Kill \u2013 By John Arquilla |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107171044/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |archivedate=2013-01-07 }}</ref>\n\n== Society and culture ==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20285 quot;Stop Violencequot; sculpture in Petah Tikva.JPG|thumb|right|A sculpture in [[Petah Tikva, Israel]] of a padlock on the warped barrel of a [[semi-automatic pistol]], with the inscription \"stop violence!\" in ({{lang-he|!\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea}})]]\n\nBeyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences. Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm \"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study\"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170920185014/https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm |date=2017-09-20 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</ref> The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.\n\n=== Economic effects ===\nIn countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded. Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.\n\nAdditionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy. Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions. One of the possible proves might be the study of [[Baten]] and Gust that used \u201c[[regicide]]\u201d as [[measurement unit]] to approximate the influence of interpersonal violence and depict the influence of high [[interpersonal violence]] on [[economic development]] and level of [[investment]]s.

But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a \u201ckilling fields\u201d perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others. In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the\nblood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).<ref name=Fretheim>{{cite journal |journal=Word & World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119093532/http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aestheticization of violence]]\n* [[Aggression]]\n* [[Corporal punishment]]\n* [[Fight-or-flight response]]\n* [[Hunting]]\n* [[Legislative violence]]\n* [[Martial arts]]\n* [[Parasitism]]\n* [[Predation]]\n* [[Resentment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Barzilai, Gad (2003).

Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups. Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain \u2013 such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation.

Victims can have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits, the cost of which quickly add up. Since the victims of youth-on-youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them, including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills. Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain. \"Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 |accessdate=November 24, 2018 }}</ref> Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). \"Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems. They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder\".<ref name=\"The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018\" />\n\nIt is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short- and long-term negative effects (e.g., poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety). By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they've experienced, negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated. As an initial step, the youths need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently. Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced. \u201cNeuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves\u201d.<ref name=\"The Body Keeps The Score\">{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 |accessdate=December 2, 2018 }}</ref> \n \nSome of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and other actions that enable youths to release their pent up emotions.

Another way to help trauma victims of youth violence is through the arts. This can be accomplished by giving them the opportunity to engage in drawing, painting, music, and singing which will give them an outlet to express themselves and their emotions in a positive way.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fabian |first1=Renee |title=Healing Invisible Wounds: Art Therapy and PTSD |url=https://www.healthline.com/health/art-therapy-for-ptsd |website=Healthline |accessdate=December 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nYouth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people.<ref name=\"The Body Keeps The Score\"/> This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences. Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort. Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance. In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, it has been recommended that schools offer mentoring programs where students can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them. Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session. Many children have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence. This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House\".<ref>{{cite web |title=WCL: Stop the Violence Resources for Illinois |url=https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |website=ABC 7 Windy City Live |publisher=ABC 7 Windy City Live |accessdate=19 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119233208/https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |archive-date=19 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence.

Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.\n\nMany strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.g. stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups. Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ploeg Jenny |author2=Fear Jana |author3=Hutchison Brian |author4=MacMillan Harriet |author5=Bolan Gale | year = 2009 | title = A Systematic Review of Interventions for Elder Abuse | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/792751c8e0953c82a111266c43ddc76236025b17| journal = Journal of Elder Abuse & Neglect | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 187\u2013210 | doi=10.1080/08946560902997181|pmid=19827325 }}</ref><ref>Pillemer K et al. \"Interventions to prevent elder mistreatment\".

Its causes are complex and occur at different levels. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or [[social ecological model]] is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:\n\nThe first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), [[Genetics of aggression|genetics]], [[brain lesion theory|brain lesions]], [[personality disorders]], [[substance abuse]], and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.<ref name=Patrick>{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = C.

In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person's risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In [[elder abuse]], important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.\n\nThe third level explores the community context\u2014i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.\n\nFinally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, [[income inequality]], the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.\n\n=== Child-rearing ===\nWhile studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373\u20131377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}</ref> Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of [[corporal punishment]] of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies.

[[Neuroscientist|Neurobiologist]] Jan Vodka emphasizes that, for those purposes, \"violent behavior is defined as overt and intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person.\"<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127111237/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/307.pdf The Neurobiology of Violence, An Update], Journal of Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 11:3, Summer 1999. As Mexican Biologist and Scientologist Adri Rodriguez says, Violence is a recurring motif in today's society.</ref>\n\nBased on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans. Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.<ref>Heather Whipps,[http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html Peace or War?

For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as \"violent\", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.<ref>{{cite book | last = Rowan | first = John | year = 1978 | title = The Structured Crowd | publisher = Davis-Poynter. | title-link = The Structured Crowd }}</ref>\n\nThe \"violent male ape\" image is often brought up in discussions of human violence. Dale Peterson and [[Richard Wrangham]]in \"Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence\" write that violence is inherent in humans, though not inevitable.\nHowever, William L. Ury, editor of a book called \"We Must Fight! From the Battlefield to the Schoolyard\u2014A New Perspective on Violent Conflict and Its Prevention\" criticizes the \"killer ape\" myth in his book which brings together discussions from two Harvard Law School symposiums.

The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to \"do justice\", i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.<ref>M. Moore \"Public Health and Criminal Justice Approaches to Prevention.\"1992. In Vol. 16 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, edited by M. Tonry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref>\n\nThe criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes \u2013 through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3938be88dc32dacf1e139dc19639d332fd956bc| journal = Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 82\u201394 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x| pmid = 15152429 }}</ref>\n\nIn recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and [[problem-oriented policing]] aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it \u2013 and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.<ref>Bratton W (with Knobler P). Turnaround: how America's top cop reversed the crime epidemic. New York: Random House, 1998</ref> Juvenile justice systems \u2013 an important component of criminal justice systems \u2013 are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the \"Blueprints for violence prevention\" programme at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].<ref>Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence [http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints \"Blueprints for violence prevention/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103080341/http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/ |date=2012-01-03 }}</ref>\n\n=== Public health ===\nThe public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.<ref name=\"who.int\" /> Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely \"criminal\" or \"medical\" problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the [[Social ecological model]].\n\nFrom a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:\n* Primary prevention \u2013 approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.\n* Secondary prevention \u2013 approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.\n* Tertiary prevention \u2013 approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.\n\nA public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible \"symptoms\". This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.\n\nThe public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:\n# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.\n# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.\n# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.\n# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.\n\nIn many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.<ref>Gordon JE, \"The epidemiology of accidents,\" ''American Journal of Public Health'', 1949; 504\u201315.</ref> In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to \"extending life\" or to a \"complete state of well-being\". He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Abad Gomez H | year = 1962 | title = Violence requires epidemiological studies | url = | journal = Tribuna Medica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1\u201312 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dahlberg L. |author2=Mercy J. | year = 2009 | title = History of violence as a public health issue | url = | journal = Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 167\u2013172 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.2.mhst1-0902|pmid=23190546 }}</ref> This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.\n\nThe global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25<ref>[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf \"WHA49.25 Prevention of violence: a public health priority\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }}</ref> which declared violence \"a leading worldwide public health problem\" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).<ref name=\"who.int\" />\n\nThe case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3938be88dc32dacf1e139dc19639d332fd956bc| journal = Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82\u201388 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x| pmid = 15152429 }}</ref> First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places \u2013 which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries \u2013 than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse \u2013 which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.\n\n=== Human rights ===\n[[File:Abdulredha Buhmaid on floor.jpeg|thumb|[[Bahrain]]'s pro-democracy protesters killed by military, February 2011]]\nThe [[human rights]] approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, [[autonomy]] and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to [[privacy]]; and the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]. These human rights are enshrined in [[international human rights law|international and regional treaties]] and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.\n\n=== Geographical context ===\nViolence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, \"appears whenever power is in jeopardy\" and \"in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles\".<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\">Hyndman, J. (2009) Violence in Gregory, D., Johnston, R., Pratt, G., Watts, M. and Whatmore, S. eds. Dictionary of Human Geography, Wiley-Blackwell, NJ: 798-799.</ref> Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories \u2013 direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that \"geography came late to theorizing violence\"<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.<ref>Bowlby, S. (2001) Social Geography, in Smelser, N. and Baltes, P. eds. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Oxford, Elsevier, 14293-14299.</ref>\nAlong with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.\n\nDerek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection ''Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence'', which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.<ref>Gregory, Derek and Pred, Alan'', 2006 Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence''. London: Routledge.</ref> Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When \"modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law\",<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" /> Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s concepts of [[state of exception]] and ''[[homo sacer]]'' are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this \"in limbo\" reality is designed to be in place \"until further notice\u2026the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself\".<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\">Agamben, G. (1998) ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press, Stanford.</ref> For Agamben, the physical space of the camp \"is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space\".<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\" /> At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by \"juridical procedures and deployments of power\"<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\" /> that \"no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime\";<ref name=\"Agamben, G. 1998\" /> in other words, people become only ''homo sacer''. [[Guantanamo Bay]] could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.\n\nIn the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]] resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\">Ringer, G. (2002) \"Killing Fields\", in Christensen, K. and Levinson, D. eds. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York: 368-370.</ref> About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at [[Choeung Ek]], which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the [[Killing Fields]].<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made ''homo sacer'' in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields\u2014manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law\u2014featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's \"ideological intent\u2026to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative\",<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> he \"dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area\".<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When \"symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind\u2026were purged or torn down\",<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> cultural violence (defined as when \"any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence\"<ref name=\"Hyndman, J. 2009\" />) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s<ref name=\"Ringer, G. 2002\" /> continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.\n\nHuman geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, [[Adriana Cavarero]] notes that, \"as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language\".<ref name=\"Cavarero, A. 2009\">Cavarero, A. (2009) ''Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence'', Columbia University Press, New York.</ref> Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as \"horrorism\"; that is, \"as though ideally all the\u2026victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name\".<ref name=\"Cavarero, A. 2009\" /> With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}\n\n== Epidemiology ==\n[[File:No Violence Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign that calls to stop violence]]\nAs of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095\u2013128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=SY|last11=Alvarado|first11=M|last12=Anderson|first12=HR|last13=Anderson|first13=LM|last14=Andrews|first14=KG|last15=Atkinson|first15=C|last16=Baddour|first16=LM|last17=Barker-Collo|first17=S|last18=Bartels|first18=DH|last19=Bell|first19=ML|last20=Benjamin|first20=EJ|last21=Bennett|first21=D|last22=Bhalla|first22=K|last23=Bikbov|first23=B|last24=Bin Abdulhak|first24=A|last25=Birbeck|first25=G|last26=Blyth|first26=F|last27=Bolliger|first27=I|last28=Boufous|first28=S|last29=Bucello|first29=C|last30=Burch|first30=M|last2=Naghavi|display-authors=29|url=http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30050819/ortblad-globalandregional-2012.pdf|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819}}</ref> [[Suicide]] accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.<ref name=Loz2012 /> Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.<ref name=Loz2012 />\n\nBy way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).<ref>[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html \"Global Burden of Disease, Disease and injury regional estimates\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.</ref>\n\nFor every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries.

This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people.

Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.\n\nAdditionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy.

But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a \u201ckilling fields\u201d perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others. In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the\nblood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).<ref name=Fretheim>{{cite journal |journal=Word & World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119093532/http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aestheticization of violence]]\n* [[Aggression]]\n* [[Corporal punishment]]\n* [[Fight-or-flight response]]\n* [[Hunting]]\n* [[Legislative violence]]\n* [[Martial arts]]\n* [[Parasitism]]\n* [[Predation]]\n* [[Resentment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Barzilai, Gad (2003).
