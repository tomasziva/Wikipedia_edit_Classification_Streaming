These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\n\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]), a large development south of [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] on the [[Railway Lands]], a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; [[John Andrews (architect)|John Andrews Architects]]; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).<ref name=\"skyscraper\" /><ref name=\"emporis\" /><ref name=\"CNTower\" />\n\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably [[First Canadian Place]]. The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nAt the time, most data communications took place over [[Microwave#Communication|point-to-point microwave]] links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\n\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite web| author=[[The Hahn Company|TrizecHahn]]| title=A Brief Overview of the CN Tower| url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/cntower/cntower_overview.html| publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]| accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (later renamed SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe CN Tower was built by Canada Cement Company<ref name=\"Canada Cement Company\">title=Canada Cement Building| url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Canada_Cement_Building,_Montreal_04.jpg | access date=August 22, 2019</ref> (also known as the Cement Foundation Company of Canada at the time),<ref>Barr, Elinar, Jan. 1, 2015, p. 173 | title=Swedes in Canada: Invisible Immigrants |\npublisher=[[University of Toronto Press]], Canada, {{ISBN|978-1442613744}},  576 pages| accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> a subsidiary of Sweden's [[Skanska]], a global project-development and construction group.\n\n [[File:Ripleys Aquarium Toronto map.png|thumb|left|Map showing the location of the CN Tower and nearby buildings and structures]]\nConstruction began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, {{convert|56000|t|ST LT|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[soil|earth]] and [[shale]] were removed to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the centre, and a base incorporating {{convert|7000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete with {{convert|450|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[rebar]] and {{convert|36|t|ST LT|abbr=on}} of [[wire rope|steel cable]] had been built to a thickness of {{convert|6.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nTo create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised [[Slip forming|slipform]] at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured Monday to Friday (and not continuously) by a small team of people until February 22, 1974, at which time it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built [[Inco Superstack]] in Sudbury, which was built using similar methods.\n\nThe tower contains {{convert|40500|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive [[plumb bob]]s hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only {{convert|29|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CNTower\" /><ref name=\"ieee\" />\n\n[[File:CN Tower40 construction skycrane March 1975 01c.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skycrane \"Olga\" lifting antenna segment]]\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]] helicopter became available when the [[United States Army]] sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\n\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino Tower]], and bringing the total mass to {{convert|118000|t|ST LT|abbr=on}}.\n\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Fulford| first=Robert| date=March 13, 1996| title=Accidental city: the transformation of Toronto| publisher=MacFarlane, Walter & Ross| page=32| isbn=978-0395773079}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Phases of construction ====\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"135px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:CN Tower footings 1973.jpg|Constructing the base, July 1973\nFile:Cntower1974.jpg|Brackets being raised, August 1974\nFile:CN Tower50 construction skycrane March 1975 01d.jpg|Helicopter lifting part of antenna, March 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction (April 1975).jpg|Main pod construction, April 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction.jpg|Nearing completion, December 1975\nFile:CN Tower 1976.jpg|Two months after opening, August 1976\n</gallery>\n\n==== Architects ====\n*[[WZMH Architects]]\n*[[John Andrews (architect)|John Hamilton Andrews]]\n*Webb Zerafa\n*Menkes Housden with the help of E.R.

[[Canadian National Railway]] sold the tower prior to taking the company private in 1995, when it decided to divest all operations not directly related to its core freight shipping businesses.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the CN Tower was practically the only development along Front Street West; it was still possible to see Lake Ontario from the foot of the CN Tower due to the expansive parking lots and lack of development in the area at the time. As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] (north building) in 1984 and SkyDome in 1989 (renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005), the former [[Railway Lands]] were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the [[SkyWalk]] in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] railway and subway station,  and, in turn, to the city's [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a [[Manhattanization|boom]] in [[condominium]] construction in the first quarter of the 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the [[Ripley's Aquarium of Canada|Ripley's Aquarium]] by the base of the tower.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n== Events ==\n[[File:2015 Toronto Pan American Games-Laslovarga.jpeg|thumb|right|Fireworks display on the CN Tower during [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|the opening ceremony]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].]]\n*While still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world's tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.<ref name=records/>\n*When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at {{convert|447|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at {{convert|346|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at {{convert|342|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/> One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Information |url=https://www.cntower.ca/site_Files/Content/PDF/Press_Kit/CN_Tower_General_Information_2013_Revised.pdf |publisher=CN Tower |date=2013}}</ref>\n*Stuntman [[Dar Robinson]] jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980.

The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the [[Stairs|stairwells]] and power and plumbing connections. The tower's six [[elevator]]s are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a {{convert|102|m|ft|1|adj=on}} tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace, which are both located at an elevation of {{convert|342|m|ft|0}}, the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as \"Indoor Observation Level\") located at {{convert|346|m|ft|0}}, and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as \"Space Deck\") at {{convert|446.5|m|ft|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |title=CN Tower |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |work=SkyscraperPage.com |publisher=Skyscraper Source Media |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406071501/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> just below the metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].

These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\n\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]), a large development south of [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] on the [[Railway Lands]], a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; [[John Andrews (architect)|John Andrews Architects]]; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).<ref name=\"skyscraper\" /><ref name=\"emporis\" /><ref name=\"CNTower\" />\n\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably [[First Canadian Place]]. The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nAt the time, most data communications took place over [[Microwave#Communication|point-to-point microwave]] links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\n\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite web| author=[[The Hahn Company|TrizecHahn]]| title=A Brief Overview of the CN Tower| url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/cntower/cntower_overview.html| publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]| accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (later renamed SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.<ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe CN Tower was built by Canada Cement Company<ref name=\"Canada Cement Company\">title=Canada Cement Building| url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Canada_Cement_Building,_Montreal_04.jpg | access date=August 22, 2019</ref> (also known as the Cement Foundation Company of Canada at the time),<ref>Barr, Elinar, Jan. 1, 2015, p. 173 | title=Swedes in Canada: Invisible Immigrants |\npublisher=[[University of Toronto Press]], Canada, {{ISBN|978-1442613744}},  576 pages| accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> a subsidiary of Sweden's [[Skanska]], a global project-development and construction group.\n\n [[File:Ripleys Aquarium Toronto map.png|thumb|left|Map showing the location of the CN Tower and nearby buildings and structures]]\nConstruction began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, {{convert|56000|t|ST LT|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[soil|earth]] and [[shale]] were removed to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the centre, and a base incorporating {{convert|7000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete with {{convert|450|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[rebar]] and {{convert|36|t|ST LT|abbr=on}} of [[wire rope|steel cable]] had been built to a thickness of {{convert|6.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nTo create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised [[Slip forming|slipform]] at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured Monday to Friday (and not continuously) by a small team of people until February 22, 1974, at which time it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built [[Inco Superstack]] in Sudbury, which was built using similar methods.\n\nThe tower contains {{convert|40500|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive [[plumb bob]]s hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only {{convert|29|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CNTower\" /><ref name=\"ieee\" />\n\n[[File:CN Tower40 construction skycrane March 1975 01c.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skycrane \"Olga\" lifting antenna segment]]\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.<ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]] helicopter became available when the [[United States Army]] sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\n\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino Tower]], and bringing the total mass to {{convert|118000|t|ST LT|abbr=on}}.\n\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Fulford| first=Robert| date=March 13, 1996| title=Accidental city: the transformation of Toronto| publisher=MacFarlane, Walter & Ross| page=32| isbn=978-0395773079}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Phases of construction ====\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"135px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:CN Tower footings 1973.jpg|Constructing the base, July 1973\nFile:Cntower1974.jpg|Brackets being raised, August 1974\nFile:CN Tower50 construction skycrane March 1975 01d.jpg|Helicopter lifting part of antenna, March 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction (April 1975).jpg|Main pod construction, April 1975\nFile:CN Tower under construction.jpg|Nearing completion, December 1975\nFile:CN Tower 1976.jpg|Two months after opening, August 1976\n</gallery>\n\n==== Architects ====\n*[[WZMH Architects]]\n*[[John Andrews (architect)|John Hamilton Andrews]]\n*Webb Zerafa\n*Menkes Housden with the help of E.R.

As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] (north building) in 1984 and SkyDome in 1989 (renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005), the former [[Railway Lands]] were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the [[SkyWalk]] in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] railway and subway station,  and, in turn, to the city's [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a [[Manhattanization|boom]] in [[condominium]] construction in the first quarter of the 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the [[Ripley's Aquarium of Canada|Ripley's Aquarium]] by the base of the tower.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"CNTower\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/>\n\n== Events ==\n[[File:2015 Toronto Pan American Games-Laslovarga.jpeg|thumb|right|Fireworks display on the CN Tower during [[2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony|the opening ceremony]] of the [[2015 Pan American Games]].]]\n*While still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world's tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.<ref name=records/>\n*When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at {{convert|447|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at {{convert|346|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at {{convert|342|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"great\"/><ref name=\"ieee\"/> One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Information |url=https://www.cntower.ca/site_Files/Content/PDF/Press_Kit/CN_Tower_General_Information_2013_Revised.pdf |publisher=CN Tower |date=2013}}</ref>\n*Stuntman [[Dar Robinson]] jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980.

The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the [[Stairs|stairwells]] and power and plumbing connections. The tower's six [[elevator]]s are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a {{convert|102|m|ft|1|adj=on}} tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace, which are both located at an elevation of {{convert|342|m|ft|0}}, the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as \"Indoor Observation Level\") located at {{convert|346|m|ft|0}}, and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as \"Space Deck\") at {{convert|446.5|m|ft|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |title=CN Tower |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |work=SkyscraperPage.com |publisher=Skyscraper Source Media |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406071501/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21 |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> just below the metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The hexagonal shape is visible between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large [[tripod]].\n\nThe main deck level is seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas \u2014 at {{convert|338|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} \u2014 is a large white donut-shaped [[radome]] containing the structure's [[UHF]] transmitters.
