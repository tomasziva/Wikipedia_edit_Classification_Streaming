The breeding season of the gray fox varies geographically; in [[Michigan]], the gray fox mates in early March, in [[Alabama]], breeding peaks occur in February. The gestation period lasts approximately 53 days. Litter size ranges from 1 to 7, with a mean of 3.8 young per female. The sexual maturity of females is around 10 months of age. Kits begin to hunt with their parents at the age of 3 months. By the time that they are four months old, the kits will have developed their permanent dentition and can now easily forage on their own. The family group remains together until the autumn, when the young males reach sexual maturity, then they disperse.<ref name=\"Fritzell\" /> Out of a study of nine juvenile gray foxes, only the males dispersed up to 84&nbsp;km. The juvenile females stayed within proximity of the den within 3&nbsp;km and always returned.<ref>Sheldon, 1953</ref> On the other hand, adult gray foxes showed no signs of dispersion for either gender.<ref>Follmann, 1973</ref>\n\nThe annual reproductive cycle of males has been described through epididymal smears and become fertile earlier and remain fertile longer than the fertility of females.<ref name=\"Fritzell\" />\n\nDens are used at any time during the year but mostly during whelping season. Dens are built in brushy or wooded regions and are less obvious than the dens of the [[red fox]]. Logs, trees, rocks, burrows, or abandoned dwellings serve as suitable den sites.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Diet ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = greyfox.jpg\n| width1 = 225\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = A gray fox at night\n| image2 = Adult Male & Female Grey Fox.jpg\n| width2 = 170\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Adult male and female gray fox\n| footer = \n}}\n\nThe gray fox is an [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], solitary hunter. It frequently preys on the [[eastern cottontail]] (''Sylvilagus floridanus'') in the eastern U.S., though it will readily catch [[vole]]s, [[shrew]]s, and [[bird]]s.

Its strong, hooked claws allow it to scramble up trees to escape many predators, such as the [[domestic dog]] or the [[coyote]],<ref name=Fedriani/> or to reach tree-bound or arboreal food sources. It can climb branchless, vertical trunks to heights of 18 meters and jump from branch to branch.<ref>Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio; Hoffman, Michael; and MacDonald David W.

The gray fox is primarily [[nocturnal]] or [[crepuscular]] and makes its den in hollow trees, stumps or appropriated burrows during the day. Such gray fox tree dens may be located 30&nbsp;ft above the ground.<ref name=a122/> Prior to European colonization of North America, the red fox was found primarily in boreal forest and the gray fox in deciduous forest.

The breeding season of the gray fox varies geographically; in [[Michigan]], the gray fox mates in early March, in [[Alabama]], breeding peaks occur in February. The gestation period lasts approximately 53 days. Litter size ranges from 1 to 7, with a mean of 3.8 young per female. The sexual maturity of females is around 10 months of age. Kits begin to hunt with their parents at the age of 3 months. By the time that they are four months old, the kits will have developed their permanent dentition and can now easily forage on their own. The family group remains together until the autumn, when the young males reach sexual maturity, then they disperse.<ref name=\"Fritzell\" /> Out of a study of nine juvenile gray foxes, only the males dispersed up to 84&nbsp;km. The juvenile females stayed within proximity of the den within 3&nbsp;km and always returned.<ref>Sheldon, 1953</ref> On the other hand, adult gray foxes showed no signs of dispersion for either gender.<ref>Follmann, 1973</ref>\n\nThe annual reproductive cycle of males has been described through epididymal smears and become fertile earlier and remain fertile longer than the fertility of females.<ref name=\"Fritzell\" />\n\nDens are used at any time during the year but mostly during whelping season. Dens are built in brushy or wooded regions and are less obvious than the dens of the [[red fox]]. Logs, trees, rocks, burrows, or abandoned dwellings serve as suitable den sites.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Diet ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = greyfox.jpg\n| width1 = 225\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = A gray fox at night\n| image2 = Adult Male & Female Grey Fox.jpg\n| width2 = 170\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Adult male and female gray fox\n| footer = \n}}\n\nThe gray fox is an [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], solitary hunter. It frequently preys on the [[eastern cottontail]] (''Sylvilagus floridanus'') in the eastern U.S., though it will readily catch [[vole]]s, [[shrew]]s, and [[bird]]s. In California, the gray fox primarily eats rodents, followed by [[lagomorph]]s, e.g. [[jackrabbit]], [[brush rabbit]], etc.<ref name=Fedriani/> In some parts of the Western United States (such as in the Zion National Park in Utah), the gray fox is primarily insectivorous and herbivorous.<ref name=a124>Alderton, p. 124.</ref> Fruit is an important component of the diet of the gray fox and they seek whatever [[fruit]]s are readily available, generally eating more vegetable matter than does the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'').<ref name=CWC/>\n\n== Subspecies ==\n[[File:Virginianusskull.jpg|upright|thumb|Gray fox skull]]\n<!--[[File:Crab-eating Fox (Cerdocyon thous).jpg|upright|thumb|''Urocyon cinereoargenteus'' from, Panama]] -->\nThere are 16 subspecies recognized for the gray fox.<ref name=Fritzell/>\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus borealis'' (New England)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus californicus'' (southern California)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus cinereoargenteus'' (eastern United States)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus costaricensis'' (Costa Rica)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus floridanus'' (Gulf states)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus fraterculus'' (Yucat\u00e1n)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus furvus'' (Panama)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus guatemalae'' (southernmost Mexico south to Nicaragua)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus madrensis'' (southern Sonora, south-west Chihuahua, and north-west Durango)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus nigrirostris'' (south-west Mexico)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus ocythous'' (Central Plains states)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus orinomus'' (southern Mexico, Isthmus of Tehuantepec)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus peninsularis'' (Baja California)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus scottii'' (south-western United States and northern Mexico)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus townsendi'' (northern California and Oregon)\n*''Urocyon cinereoargenteus venezuelae'' (Colombia and Venezuela)\n\n==Parasites==\nParasites of gray fox include trematode ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mills J.
