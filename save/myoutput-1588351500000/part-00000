However, [[People of the Book|Christians and Jews]] were subject to a special tax called [[jizya]], to the state, in which they accepted cultural inferiority and legal and social rights lesser to that of the Muslim colonizers, but in return provided internal autonomy in practicing their religion and offered some level of protection by the Muslim rulers. \n\nUnder the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, al-Andalus was a beacon of learning, and the city of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], the largest in Europe, became one of the leading cultural and economic centres throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]], Europe, and the Islamic world.

After the fall of the Umayyad caliphate, al-Andalus was fragmented into minor states and principalities. Attacks from the Christians intensified, led by the Castilians under [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]]. The Almoravid empire intervened and repelled the Christian attacks on the region, deposing the weak Andalusi Muslim princes, and included al-Andalus under direct [[Berber people|Berber]] rule. In the next century and a half, al-Andalus became a province of the Berber Muslim empires of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and [[Almohads]], both based in [[Marrakesh]].\n\nUltimately, the Christian kingdoms in the north of the Iberian Peninsula overpowered the Muslim states to the south. In 1085, Alfonso VI captured [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], starting a gradual decline of Muslim power. With the fall of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, most of the south quickly fell under Christian rule and the [[Emirate of Granada]] became a tributary state of the [[Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Castile]]<!--'Kingdom of Castile' nomenclature refers to another era--> two years later. In 1249, the Portuguese Reconquista culminated with the conquest of the [[Algarve]] by [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], leaving Granada as the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula.

After a decisive victory over King [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] on July 19, 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by Arab governor [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] of [[Ifriqiya]], brought most of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] under Muslim rule in a seven-year campaign. They crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and occupied Visigothic [[Septimania]] in southern France.\n\nMost of the Iberian peninsula became part of the expanding [[Umayyad|Umayyad Empire]], under the name of ''al-Andalus''. It was organized as a province subordinate to [[Ifriqiya]], so, for the first few decades, the [[List of Umayyad Governors of Al-Andalus|governors of al-Andalus]] were appointed by the emir of [[Kairouan]], rather than the Caliph in Damascus. The regional capital was set at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and the first influx of Muslim settlers was widely distributed.\n\nThe small army Tariq led in the initial conquest consisted mostly of Berbers, while Musa's largely Arab force of over 12,000 soldiers was accompanied by a group of [[Mawla|''maw\u0101l\u012b'']] (Arabic, \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a), that is, non-Arab Muslims, who were clients of the Arabs.

However, after crushing Odo's Berber ally [[Uthman ibn Naissa]] on the eastern Pyrenees, [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] led an expedition north across the western Pyrenees and defeated the Aquitanian duke, who in turn appealed to the [[Franks|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] for assistance, offering to place himself under Carolingian sovereignty. At the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, the al-Andalus raiding army was defeated by Charles Martel. In 734, the Andalusi launched raids to the east, capturing [[Avignon]] and [[Arles]] and overran much of [[Provence]]. In 737, they traveled up the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] valley, reaching as far north as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Charles Martel of the Franks, with the assistance of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], invaded Burgundy and Provence and expelled the raiders by 739.\n\n[[File:Mezquita-Catedral de Cordoba 01.JPG|thumb|upright|Interior of the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba]] formerly the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba. The original mosque (742), since much enlarged, was built on the site of the Visigothic Christian 'Saint Vincent basilica' (600).]]\n\nRelations between Arabs and [[Berber people|Berbers]] in al-Andalus had been tense in the years after the conquest. Berbers heavily outnumbered the Arabs in the province, had done the bulk of the fighting, and were assigned the harsher duties (e.g. garrisoning the more troubled areas). Although some Arab governors had cultivated their Berber lieutenants, others had grievously mistreated them. Mutinies by Berber soldiers were frequent; e.g., in 729, the Berber commander Munnus had revolted and managed to carve out a rebel state in [[Cerdanya]] for a while.\n\nIn 740, a [[Berber Revolt]] erupted in the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa). To put down the rebellion, the Umayyad Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] dispatched a large Arab army, composed of regiments (''[[Jund]]s'') of [[Bilad Ash-Sham]],<ref>Specifically, 27,000 Arab troops were composed of 6,000 men from each of the four main ''junds'' of [[Jund Dimashq|Jund Dimashq (Damascus)]], [[Jund Hims|Jund Hims (Homs)]], [[Jund al-Urdunn|Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan)]], and [[Jund Filastin|Jund Filastin (Filastin)]], plus 3,000 from [[Jund Qinnasrin]]. An additional 3,000 were picked up in [[Egypt]]. See R. Dozy (1913) ''Spanish Islam: A History of the Muslims in Spain'' (translated by Francis Griffin Stokes from Dozy's original (1861) French ''Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne'', with consultation of the 1874 German version and the 1877 Spanish version) Chatto & Windus, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AtQ7yAftTdQC&pg=PA133 page 133]</ref> to North Africa. But the great Umayyad army was crushed by the Berber rebels at the [[Battle of Bagdoura]] (in Morocco). Heartened by the victories of their North African brethren, the Berbers of al-Andalus quickly raised their own revolt. Berber garrisons in the north of the Iberian Peninsula mutinied, deposed their Arab commanders, and organized a large rebel army to march against the strongholds of Toledo, Cordoba, and Algeciras.\n\nIn 741, Balj b.

However, a quarrel immediately erupted between the Syrian commanders and the Andalusi, the so-called \"original Arabs\" of the earlier contingents. The Syrians defeated them at the hard-fought Battle of Aqua Portora in August 742 but were too few to impose themselves on the province.\n\nThe quarrel was settled in 743 when [[Abu l-Hattar al Husam ibn Darar al-Kalbi|Ab\u016b l-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r al-\u1e24us\u0101m]], the new governor of al-Andalus, assigned the Syrians to regimental fiefs across al-Andalus<ref name=\"Makki1992\">{{cite book|author=Mahmoud Makki|editor=Salma Khadra Jayyusi |editor2=Manuela Mar\u00edn|title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbfORLWv1HkC&pg=PA12|year=1992|publisher=Brill|isbn=90-04-09599-3|pages=12\u201313|chapter=The Political History of Al-Andalus}}</ref>{{Snd}} the Damascus jund was established in Elvira ([[Granada]]), the Jordan jund in Rayyu ([[M\u00e1laga]] and [[Archidona]]), the Jund Filastin in [[Medina-Sidonia]] and [[Jerez]], the Emesa (Hims) jund in [[Seville]] and [[Niebla, Spain|Niebla]], and the Qinnasrin jund in [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]].

After the rebellious Berber garrisons evacuated the northern frontier fortresses, the Christian king [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] set about immediately seizing the empty forts for himself, quickly adding the northwestern provinces of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n]] to his fledgling kingdom. The Asturians evacuated the Christian populations from the towns and villages of the Galician-Leonese lowlands, creating an empty buffer zone in the [[Douro River]] valley (the \"[[Desert of the Duero]]\"). This newly emptied frontier remained roughly in place for the next few centuries as the boundary between the Christian north and the Islamic south. Between this frontier and its heartland in the south, the al-Andalus state had three large [[March (territory)|march territories]] (''[[thughur]]''): the [[Lower March]] (capital initially at [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], later [[Badajoz]]), the Middle March (centered at Toledo), and the [[Upper March]] (centered at [[Zaragoza]]).\n\nThese disturbances and disorders also allowed the Franks, now under the leadership of [[Pepin the Short]], to invade the strategic strip of [[Septimania]] in 752, hoping to deprive al-Andalus of an easy launching pad for raids into [[Francia]]. After a lengthy siege, the last Arab stronghold, the citadel of [[Narbonne]], finally [[Siege of Narbonne (752\u2013759)|fell to the Franks in 759]]. Al-Andalus was sealed off at the Pyrenees.<ref>[[Franco Cardini]], ''Europe and Islam '', Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe third consequence of the Berber revolt was the collapse of the authority of the [[Damascus]] Caliphate over the western provinces. With the Umayyad Caliphs distracted by the challenge of the [[Abbasid]]s in the east, the western provinces of the Maghreb and al-Andalus spun out of their control. From around 745, the [[Fihrids]], an illustrious local Arab clan descended from [[Uqba ibn Nafi|Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri]], seized power in the western provinces and ruled them almost as a private family empire of their own{{Snd}} [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri]] in Ifriqiya and [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri]] in al-Andalus. The Fihrids welcomed the fall of the Umayyads in the east, in 750, and sought to reach an understanding with the Abbasids, hoping they might be allowed to continue their autonomous existence.  But when the Abbasids rejected the offer and demanded submission, the Fihrids declared independence and, probably out of spite, invited the deposed remnants of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in their dominions. It was a fateful decision that they soon regretted, for the Umayyads, the sons and grandsons of caliphs, had a more legitimate claim to rule than the Fihrids themselves. Rebellious-minded local lords, disenchanted with the autocratic rule of the Fihrids, conspired with the arriving Umayyad exiles.\n\n=== Umayyad Emirate and Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba ===\n{{main|Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba}}\nIn 756, the exiled Umayyad prince [[Abd al-Rahman I]] (nicknamed ''al-D\u0101khil'', the 'Immigrant') ousted Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri to establish himself as the [[Emir]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He refused to submit to the Abbasid caliph, as Abbasid forces had killed most of his family. Over a thirty-year reign, he established a tenuous rule over much of al-Andalus, overcoming partisans of both the al-Fihri family and of the Abbasid caliph.<ref>Collins, Roger. ''The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710\u2013797'', pp. 113\u2013140 & 168\u2013182.</ref>\n\nFor the next century and a half, his descendants continued as emirs of C\u00f3rdoba with nominal control over the rest of al-Andalus and sometimes parts of western [[North Africa]], but with real control, particularly over the marches along the Christian border, vacillating depending on the competence of the individual emir. Indeed, the power of emir [[Abdallah ibn Muhammad]] (circa 900) did not extend beyond C\u00f3rdoba itself. But his grandson [[Abd-al-Rahman III]], who succeeded him in 912, not only rapidly restored Umayyad power throughout al-Andalus but extended it into western North Africa as well. In 929 he proclaimed himself [[Caliph of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliph]], elevating the emirate to a position competing in prestige not only with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph in [[Baghdad]] but also the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph in [[Tunis]], with whom he was competing for control of North Africa.\n\n[[File:Al Andalus & Christian Kingdoms.png|thumb|left|The Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 10th century]][[File:Hisham II of C\u00f3rdoba Dinar 94227.jpg|thumb|Gold dinar minted in C\u00f3rdoba during the reign of [[Hisham II]]]]\n\nThe period of the Caliphate is seen as the [[Islamic Golden Age|golden age]] of al-Andalus.

In 1212, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. The Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Abu Ya'qub Yusuf II]] rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but now weakened, were quickly conquered by Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of [[Murcia]] (1243) and the [[Algarve]] (1249), only the [[Emirate of Granada]] remained as a Muslim state in Iberia, tributary of Castile until 1492. Most of its tribute was paid in gold that was carried to Iberia from present-day [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] through the merchant routes of the [[Sahara]].\n\nThe last Muslim threat to the Christian kingdoms was the rise of the [[Marinids]] in Morocco during the 14th century. They took Granada into their sphere of influence and occupied some of its cities, like [[Algeciras]]. However, they were unable to take [[Tarifa]], which held out until the arrival of the Castilian Army led by [[Alfonso XI]].

Eventually, the Muladies, and later the Berber tribes, adopted an Arabic identity like the majority of subject people in [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[North Africa]].

These advances were in part facilitated by technological innovations in irrigation systems. State organized, large-scale irrigation projects provided water to city baths, mosques, gardens, residential homes, and governing palaces, such as the al-Hambra and its gardens in Granada. Collective, peasant-built irrigation infrastructure also played an important role, especially in agriculture. Many of these irrigation techniques, especially those utilized by peasants, were brought to al-Andalus by migrating [[Berbers|Berber]] and Arab tribes. Although some irrigation projects built on existing Roman infrastructure, most of al-Andalus's irrigation systems were new projects built separate from old Roman aqueducts.

Later, ''al-Mustansir'' ([[Al-Hakam II]]) went yet further, building a university and libraries in C\u00f3rdoba. C\u00f3rdoba became one of the world's leading centres of medicine and philosophical debate.\n\n[[File:AverroesColor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Averroes]], founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, was influential in the rise of [[Secularism|secular thought]] in [[Western Europe]]. Detail from ''Triunfo de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' by [[Andrea Bonaiuto]], 14th century]]\n\nWhen Al-Hakam's son [[Hisham II]] took over, real power was ceded to the ''hajib'', [[al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]]. Al-Mansur was a distinctly religious man and disapproved of the sciences of [[astronomy]], [[logic]], and especially of [[astrology]], so much so that many books on these subjects, which had been preserved and collected at great expense by [[Al-Hakam II]], were [[Book burning|burned publicly]]. With Al-Mansur's death in 1002, interest in philosophy revived. Numerous scholars emerged, including [[Abu Uthman Ibn Fathun]], whose masterwork was the philosophical treatise \"[[Tree of Wisdom]]\". [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]] (died 1008) was an outstanding scholar in astronomy and astrology; he was an intrepid traveller who journeyed all over the Islamic world and beyond and kept in touch with the [[Brethren of Purity]]. He is said to have brought the 51 \"[[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]]\" to ''al-Andalus'' and added the compendium to this work, although it is quite possible that it was added later by another scholar with the name al-Majriti. Another book attributed to al-Majriti is the ''[[Ghayat al-Hakim]]'', \"The Aim of the Sage\", which explored a synthesis of [[Platonism]] with [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermetic philosophy]]. Its use of incantations led the book to be widely dismissed in later years, although the [[Sufi]] communities continued to study it.\n\nA prominent follower of al-Majriti was the philosopher and geometer [[Abu al-Hakam al-Kirmani]] who was followed, in turn, by Abu Bakr Ibn al-Sayigh, usually known in the Arab world as [[Ibn Bajjah]], \"[[Avempace]]\".\n\nThe al-Andalus philosopher [[Averroes]] (1126\u20131198) was the founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, and his works and commentaries influenced medieval thought in Western Europe{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Another influential al-Andalus philosopher was [[Ibn Tufail]].\n\n====Jewish philosophy and culture====\n{{Main|Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain}}\n[[File:Located in central Spain, 70 km south of Madrid. It is the capital of the province of Toledo.jpg|thumb|Jewish Street Sign in [[Toledo, Spain]]]]\n\nAs [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Jewish thought in Babylonia]] declined, the tolerance of ''al-Andalus'' made it the new centre of Jewish intellectual endeavours. Poets and commentators like [[Judah Halevi]] (1086\u20131145) and [[Dunash ben Labrat]] (920\u2013990) contributed to the cultural life of ''al-Andalus'', but the area was even more important to the development of Jewish philosophy. A stream of Jewish philosophers, cross-fertilizing with Muslim philosophers (see [[joint Jewish and Islamic philosophies]]), culminated with the widely celebrated Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131205), though he did not actually do any of his work in ''al-Andalus'', his family having fled persecution by the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]] when he was 13.\n\n====Homosexuality====\nThe [[Encyclopedia of Homosexuality]] states that \"Al-Andalus had many links to Hellenistic culture, and except for the Almoravid and Almohadic periods (1086\u20131212), it was hedonistic and tolerant of homosexuality, indeed one of the times in world history in which sensuality of all sorts has been most openly enjoyed. Important rulers such as Abd al-Rahman III, al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and al-Mu-tamid openly chose boys as sexual partners, and kept catamites. Homosexual prostitution was widespread, and its customers came from higher levels of society than those of heterosexual prostitutes.\" The poetry of writers such as [[Abu Nuwas]] and anthologies of poetry such as the [[R\u0101y\u0101t al-mubarriz\u012bn wa-gh\u0101y\u0101t al-mumayyaz\u012bn]] are known in part for their homoerotic and \"abundant pederastic poetry\". Such themes were also found in the Sephardic Jewish poetry of the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dynes |first1=Wayne R. |title=Encyclopedia of Homosexuality |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317368120 |pages=1237 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g7TOCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT487&dq=al-Andalus+homosexual#v=onepage&q=al-Andalus%20homosexual&f=false |accessdate=10 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the book ''Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia'' Daniel Eisenberg describes [[homosexuality]] as \"a key symbolic issue throughout the Middle Ages in Iberia\", stating that \"in al-Andalus homosexual pleasures were much indulged in by the intellectual and political elite. Evidence includes the behaviour of rulers, such as Abd al-Rahmn III, Al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and Al Mu'tamid, who openly kept male harems; the memoirs of [[Abdallah ibn Buluggin]], last Zirid king of Granada, makes references to male prostitutes, who charged higher fees and had a higher class of clientele than did their female counter-parts: the repeated criticisms of Christians; and especially the abundant poetry. Both [[pederasty]] and love between adult males are found. Although homosexual practices were never officially condoned, prohibitions against them were rarely enforced, and usually there was not even a pretense of doing so.\" Male homosexual relations allowed nonprocreative sexual practices and were not seen as a form of identity. Very little is known about the homosexual behaviour of women.<ref name=\"GerliArmistead2003\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Eisenberg |editor1=E. Michael Gerli |editor2=Samuel G.

However, [[People of the Book|Christians and Jews]] were subject to a higher tax called [[jizya]], to the state, in which they accepted cultural inferiority and legal and social rights lesser to that of the Muslim colonizers, but in return provided internal autonomy in practicing their religion and offered some level of protection by the Muslim rulers. \n\nUnder the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, al-Andalus was a beacon of learning, and the city of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], the largest in Europe, became one of the leading cultural and economic centres throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]], Europe, and the Islamic world.

After the fall of the Umayyad caliphate, al-Andalus was fragmented into minor states and principalities. Attacks from the Christians intensified, led by the Castilians under [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]]. The Almoravid empire intervened and repelled the Christian attacks on the region, deposing the weak Andalusi Muslim princes, and included al-Andalus under direct [[Berber people|Berber]] rule. In the next century and a half, al-Andalus became a province of the Berber Muslim empires of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and [[Almohads]], both based in [[Marrakesh]].\n\nUltimately, the Christian kingdoms in the north of the Iberian Peninsula overpowered the Muslim states to the south. In 1085, Alfonso VI captured [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], starting a gradual decline of Muslim power. With the fall of C\u00f3rdoba in 1236, most of the south quickly fell under Christian rule and the [[Emirate of Granada]] became a tributary state of the [[Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Castile]]<!--'Kingdom of Castile' nomenclature refers to another era--> two years later. In 1249, the Portuguese Reconquista culminated with the conquest of the [[Algarve]] by [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], leaving Granada as the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula.

Moreover, the existence of this name in various parts of central and northern Spain proves that ''Al-Andalus'' cannot be derived from this [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]].

After a decisive victory over King [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] on July 19, 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by Arab governor [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] of [[Ifriqiya]], brought most of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] under Muslim rule in a seven-year campaign. They crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and occupied Visigothic [[Septimania]] in southern France.\n\nMost of the Iberian peninsula became part of the expanding [[Umayyad|Umayyad Empire]], under the name of ''al-Andalus''. It was organized as a province subordinate to [[Ifriqiya]], so, for the first few decades, the [[List of Umayyad Governors of Al-Andalus|governors of al-Andalus]] were appointed by the emir of [[Kairouan]], rather than the Caliph in Damascus. The regional capital was set at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and the first influx of Muslim settlers was widely distributed.\n\nThe small army Tariq led in the initial conquest consisted mostly of Berbers, while Musa's largely Arab force of over 12,000 soldiers was accompanied by a group of [[Mawla|''maw\u0101l\u012b'']] (Arabic, \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a), that is, non-Arab Muslims, who were clients of the Arabs.

However, after crushing Odo's Berber ally [[Uthman ibn Naissa]] on the eastern Pyrenees, [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] led an expedition north across the western Pyrenees and defeated the Aquitanian duke, who in turn appealed to the [[Franks|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] for assistance, offering to place himself under Carolingian sovereignty. At the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, the al-Andalus raiding army was defeated by Charles Martel. In 734, the Andalusi launched raids to the east, capturing [[Avignon]] and [[Arles]] and overran much of [[Provence]]. In 737, they traveled up the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] valley, reaching as far north as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Charles Martel of the Franks, with the assistance of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], invaded Burgundy and Provence and expelled the raiders by 739.\n\n[[File:Mezquita-Catedral de Cordoba 01.JPG|thumb|upright|Interior of the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba]] formerly the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba.

Berbers heavily outnumbered the Arabs in the province, had done the bulk of the fighting, and were assigned the harsher duties (e.g. garrisoning the more troubled areas). Although some Arab governors had cultivated their Berber lieutenants, others had grievously mistreated them. Mutinies by Berber soldiers were frequent; e.g., in 729, the Berber commander Munnus had revolted and managed to carve out a rebel state in [[Cerdanya]] for a while.\n\nIn 740, a [[Berber Revolt]] erupted in the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa). To put down the rebellion, the Umayyad Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] dispatched a large Arab army, composed of regiments (''[[Jund]]s'') of [[Bilad Ash-Sham]],<ref>Specifically, 27,000 Arab troops were composed of 6,000 men from each of the four main ''junds'' of [[Jund Dimashq|Jund Dimashq (Damascus)]], [[Jund Hims|Jund Hims (Homs)]], [[Jund al-Urdunn|Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan)]], and [[Jund Filastin|Jund Filastin (Filastin)]], plus 3,000 from [[Jund Qinnasrin]]. An additional 3,000 were picked up in [[Egypt]]. See R.

But the great Umayyad army was crushed by the Berber rebels at the [[Battle of Bagdoura]] (in Morocco). Heartened by the victories of their North African brethren, the Berbers of al-Andalus quickly raised their own revolt. Berber garrisons in the north of the Iberian Peninsula mutinied, deposed their Arab commanders, and organized a large rebel army to march against the strongholds of Toledo, Cordoba, and Algeciras.\n\nIn 741, Balj b.

However, at the same time, unwilling to be governed, the Syrian ''junds'' carried on an existence of autonomous feudal anarchy, severely destabilizing the authority of the governor of al-Andalus.\n\n[[File:Abdul al Rahman I.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of [[Abd al-Rahman I]]]]\n\nA second significant consequence of the revolt was the expansion of the [[Kingdom of the Asturias]], hitherto confined to enclaves in the Cantabrian highlands. After the rebellious Berber garrisons evacuated the northern frontier fortresses, the Christian king [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] set about immediately seizing the empty forts for himself, quickly adding the northwestern provinces of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n]] to his fledgling kingdom. The Asturians evacuated the Christian populations from the towns and villages of the Galician-Leonese lowlands, creating an empty buffer zone in the [[Douro River]] valley (the \"[[Desert of the Duero]]\"). This newly emptied frontier remained roughly in place for the next few centuries as the boundary between the Christian north and the Islamic south. Between this frontier and its heartland in the south, the al-Andalus state had three large [[March (territory)|march territories]] (''[[thughur]]''): the [[Lower March]] (capital initially at [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], later [[Badajoz]]), the Middle March (centered at Toledo), and the [[Upper March]] (centered at [[Zaragoza]]).\n\nThese disturbances and disorders also allowed the Franks, now under the leadership of [[Pepin the Short]], to invade the strategic strip of [[Septimania]] in 752, hoping to deprive al-Andalus of an easy launching pad for raids into [[Francia]]. After a lengthy siege, the last Arab stronghold, the citadel of [[Narbonne]], finally [[Siege of Narbonne (752\u2013759)|fell to the Franks in 759]]. Al-Andalus was sealed off at the Pyrenees.<ref>[[Franco Cardini]], ''Europe and Islam '', Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe third consequence of the Berber revolt was the collapse of the authority of the [[Damascus]] Caliphate over the western provinces. With the Umayyad Caliphs distracted by the challenge of the [[Abbasid]]s in the east, the western provinces of the Maghreb and al-Andalus spun out of their control. From around 745, the [[Fihrids]], an illustrious local Arab clan descended from [[Uqba ibn Nafi|Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri]], seized power in the western provinces and ruled them almost as a private family empire of their own{{Snd}} [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri]] in Ifriqiya and [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri]] in al-Andalus. The Fihrids welcomed the fall of the Umayyads in the east, in 750, and sought to reach an understanding with the Abbasids, hoping they might be allowed to continue their autonomous existence.  But when the Abbasids rejected the offer and demanded submission, the Fihrids declared independence and, probably out of spite, invited the deposed remnants of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in their dominions. It was a fateful decision that they soon regretted, for the Umayyads, the sons and grandsons of caliphs, had a more legitimate claim to rule than the Fihrids themselves. Rebellious-minded local lords, disenchanted with the autocratic rule of the Fihrids, conspired with the arriving Umayyad exiles.\n\n=== Umayyad Emirate and Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba ===\n{{main|Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba}}\nIn 756, the exiled Umayyad prince [[Abd al-Rahman I]] (nicknamed ''al-D\u0101khil'', the 'Immigrant') ousted Y\u016bsuf al-Fihri to establish himself as the [[Emir]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He refused to submit to the Abbasid caliph, as Abbasid forces had killed most of his family. Over a thirty-year reign, he established a tenuous rule over much of al-Andalus, overcoming partisans of both the al-Fihri family and of the Abbasid caliph.<ref>Collins, Roger. ''The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710\u2013797'', pp. 113\u2013140 & 168\u2013182.</ref>\n\nFor the next century and a half, his descendants continued as emirs of C\u00f3rdoba with nominal control over the rest of al-Andalus and sometimes parts of western [[North Africa]], but with real control, particularly over the marches along the Christian border, vacillating depending on the competence of the individual emir. Indeed, the power of emir [[Abdallah ibn Muhammad]] (circa 900) did not extend beyond C\u00f3rdoba itself. But his grandson [[Abd-al-Rahman III]], who succeeded him in 912, not only rapidly restored Umayyad power throughout al-Andalus but extended it into western North Africa as well. In 929 he proclaimed himself [[Caliph of C\u00f3rdoba|Caliph]], elevating the emirate to a position competing in prestige not only with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph in [[Baghdad]] but also the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph in [[Tunis]], with whom he was competing for control of North Africa.\n\n[[File:Al Andalus & Christian Kingdoms.png|thumb|left|The Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 10th century]][[File:Hisham II of C\u00f3rdoba Dinar 94227.jpg|thumb|Gold dinar minted in C\u00f3rdoba during the reign of [[Hisham II]]]]\n\nThe period of the Caliphate is seen as the [[Islamic Golden Age|golden age]] of al-Andalus.

In 1212, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. The Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Abu Ya'qub Yusuf II]] rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but now weakened, were quickly conquered by Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of [[Murcia]] (1243) and the [[Algarve]] (1249), only the [[Emirate of Granada]] remained as a Muslim state in Iberia, tributary of Castile until 1492. Most of its tribute was paid in gold that was carried to Iberia from present-day [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] through the merchant routes of the [[Sahara]].\n\nThe last Muslim threat to the Christian kingdoms was the rise of the [[Marinids]] in Morocco during the 14th century.

In the 10th century a massive conversion of Christians took place, and ''[[muladi]]es'' (Muslims of native [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin), formed the majority of Muslims. The Muladies had spoken in a [[Romance languages|Romance]] dialect of Latin called [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] while increasingly adopting the Arabic language, which eventually evolved into the [[Andalusi Arabic]] in which Muslims, Jews, and Christians became monolingual in the last surviving Muslim state in the Iberian Peninsula, the [[Emirate of Granada]] (1230\u20131492). Eventually, the Muladies, and later the Berber tribes, adopted an Arabic identity like the majority of subject people in [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[North Africa]]. Muladies, together with other Muslims, comprised eighty percent of the population of al-Andalus by 1100.{{sfn|Glick|1999|loc=Chapter 5: Ethnic Relations}}<ref>\"The rate of conversion is slow until the tenth century (less than one-quarter of the eventual total number of converts had been converted); the explosive period coincides closely with the reign of 'Abd al-Rahmdn III (912\u2013961); the process is completed (eighty percent converted) by around 1100. The curve, moreover, makes possible a reasonable estimate of the religious distribution of the population. Assuming that there were seven million Hispano-Romans in the peninsula in 711 and that the numbers of this segment of the population remained level through the eleventh century (with population growth balancing out Christian migration to the north), then by 912 there would have been approximately 2.8 million indigenous Muslims (muwallad\u00fbn) plus Arabs and Berbers. At this point Christians still vastly outnumbered Muslims.

State organized, large-scale irrigation projects provided water to city baths, mosques, gardens, residential homes, and governing palaces, such as the al-Hambra and its gardens in Granada. Collective, peasant-built irrigation infrastructure also played an important role, especially in agriculture. Many of these irrigation techniques, especially those utilized by peasants, were brought to al-Andalus by migrating [[Berbers|Berber]] and Arab tribes. Although some irrigation projects built on existing Roman infrastructure, most of al-Andalus's irrigation systems were new projects built separate from old Roman aqueducts.

The site integrates natural qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and is a testament to Moorish culture in Al-Andalus and to the skills of the Muslim artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.\n\nThe decoration within the palace comes from the last great period of Al-Andalus art in Granada, with little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary [[Abbasid architecture]].<ref name=EB1911 /> Artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed over the course of the Nasrid Dynasty using elements created and developed during the centuries of Muslim rule on the Peninsula, including the Caliphate [[horseshoe arch]], the Almohad sebka (a grid of [[rhombuses]]), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of these, as well as innovations such as stilted arches and [[muqarnas]] (stalactite ceiling decorations). Columns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with [[arabesques]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]]. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Muhammed V, and [[Ismail I, Sultan of Granada]].\n[[File:Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba (Spain).jpg|thumb|A section of the hypostyle hall in the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]]\nIn Cordoba, the Umayyads sponsored the construction of the [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque of Cordoba]] (now a Catholic church); its key features included an arcaded hypostyle hall with 856 columns, a horseshoe-arch mihrab facing Mecca, a vaulted dome, the Court of Oranges (containing fountains and imported citrus trees) and a minaret (later converted into a bell-tower).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/early-europe-and-colonial-americas/ap-art-islamic-world-medieval/a/the-great-mosque-of-cordoba|title=The Great Mosque of Cordoba|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> The Umayyads reconstructed the [[Roman bridge of C\u00f3rdoba|Roman-era bridge]] over the Guadalquivir River in Cordoba, while the Almohads later added the [[Calahorra Tower]] to the bridge.\n\nIn Seville, Moorish rulers built the main section of the [[Giralda]] (later expanded as a bell-tower for the Seville Cathedral) as a massive minaret (resembling that of the [[Koutoubia Mosque]] in Morocco) for the Great Mosque of Seville, which also contained a ''Patio de los Naranjos'' (Court of Oranges).

Later, ''al-Mustansir'' ([[Al-Hakam II]]) went yet further, building a university and libraries in C\u00f3rdoba. C\u00f3rdoba became one of the world's leading centres of medicine and philosophical debate.\n\n[[File:AverroesColor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Averroes]], founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, was influential in the rise of [[Secularism|secular thought]] in [[Western Europe]]. Detail from ''Triunfo de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' by [[Andrea Bonaiuto]], 14th century]]\n\nWhen Al-Hakam's son [[Hisham II]] took over, real power was ceded to the ''hajib'', [[al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]]. Al-Mansur was a distinctly religious man and disapproved of the sciences of [[astronomy]], [[logic]], and especially of [[astrology]], so much so that many books on these subjects, which had been preserved and collected at great expense by [[Al-Hakam II]], were [[Book burning|burned publicly]]. With Al-Mansur's death in 1002, interest in philosophy revived. Numerous scholars emerged, including [[Abu Uthman Ibn Fathun]], whose masterwork was the philosophical treatise \"[[Tree of Wisdom]]\". [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]] (died 1008) was an outstanding scholar in astronomy and astrology; he was an intrepid traveller who journeyed all over the Islamic world and beyond and kept in touch with the [[Brethren of Purity]]. He is said to have brought the 51 \"[[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]]\" to ''al-Andalus'' and added the compendium to this work, although it is quite possible that it was added later by another scholar with the name al-Majriti. Another book attributed to al-Majriti is the ''[[Ghayat al-Hakim]]'', \"The Aim of the Sage\", which explored a synthesis of [[Platonism]] with [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermetic philosophy]]. Its use of incantations led the book to be widely dismissed in later years, although the [[Sufi]] communities continued to study it.\n\nA prominent follower of al-Majriti was the philosopher and geometer [[Abu al-Hakam al-Kirmani]] who was followed, in turn, by Abu Bakr Ibn al-Sayigh, usually known in the Arab world as [[Ibn Bajjah]], \"[[Avempace]]\".\n\nThe al-Andalus philosopher [[Averroes]] (1126\u20131198) was the founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, and his works and commentaries influenced medieval thought in Western Europe{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Another influential al-Andalus philosopher was [[Ibn Tufail]].\n\n====Jewish philosophy and culture====\n{{Main|Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain}}\n[[File:Located in central Spain, 70 km south of Madrid. It is the capital of the province of Toledo.jpg|thumb|Jewish Street Sign in [[Toledo, Spain]]]]\n\nAs [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Jewish thought in Babylonia]] declined, the tolerance of ''al-Andalus'' made it the new centre of Jewish intellectual endeavours. Poets and commentators like [[Judah Halevi]] (1086\u20131145) and [[Dunash ben Labrat]] (920\u2013990) contributed to the cultural life of ''al-Andalus'', but the area was even more important to the development of Jewish philosophy. A stream of Jewish philosophers, cross-fertilizing with Muslim philosophers (see [[joint Jewish and Islamic philosophies]]), culminated with the widely celebrated Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131205), though he did not actually do any of his work in ''al-Andalus'', his family having fled persecution by the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]] when he was 13.\n\n====Homosexuality====\nThe [[Encyclopedia of Homosexuality]] states that \"Al-Andalus had many links to Hellenistic culture, and except for the Almoravid and Almohadic periods (1086\u20131212), it was hedonistic and tolerant of homosexuality, indeed one of the times in world history in which sensuality of all sorts has been most openly enjoyed. Important rulers such as Abd al-Rahman III, al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and al-Mu-tamid openly chose boys as sexual partners, and kept catamites. Homosexual prostitution was widespread, and its customers came from higher levels of society than those of heterosexual prostitutes.\" The poetry of writers such as [[Abu Nuwas]] and anthologies of poetry such as the [[R\u0101y\u0101t al-mubarriz\u012bn wa-gh\u0101y\u0101t al-mumayyaz\u012bn]] are known in part for their homoerotic and \"abundant pederastic poetry\". Such themes were also found in the Sephardic Jewish poetry of the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dynes |first1=Wayne R. |title=Encyclopedia of Homosexuality |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317368120 |pages=1237 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g7TOCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT487&dq=al-Andalus+homosexual#v=onepage&q=al-Andalus%20homosexual&f=false |accessdate=10 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the book ''Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia'' Daniel Eisenberg describes [[homosexuality]] as \"a key symbolic issue throughout the Middle Ages in Iberia\", stating that \"in al-Andalus homosexual pleasures were much indulged in by the intellectual and political elite. Evidence includes the behaviour of rulers, such as Abd al-Rahmn III, Al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and Al Mu'tamid, who openly kept male harems; the memoirs of [[Abdallah ibn Buluggin]], last Zirid king of Granada, makes references to male prostitutes, who charged higher fees and had a higher class of clientele than did their female counter-parts: the repeated criticisms of Christians; and especially the abundant poetry. Both [[pederasty]] and love between adult males are found. Although homosexual practices were never officially condoned, prohibitions against them were rarely enforced, and usually there was not even a pretense of doing so.\" Male homosexual relations allowed nonprocreative sexual practices and were not seen as a form of identity.
