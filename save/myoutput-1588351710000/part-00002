The population is 12,024 according to the 2010 Census. It is a community about 17 miles southwest of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which is a 40-minute drive to Boston's financial district. Attractions include the Hinkley Pond and the Peak House.\n\n==History==\nThe territory that Medfield now occupies was, at the time of colonization, [[Neponset people|Neponset]] land. After the English took the Native Americans' land by force and spread a variety of diseases to the people, it was apparently sold by the Neponset leader [[Chickatabot]] to [[William Pynchon]] in the late 1620s. In 1633, however, Chickatabot died in a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] that decimated nearby Neponset, [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] and [[Pequot]] communities. Because Chickatabot and Pynchon's deal left no written deed, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] ordered \"those Indians who were present when Chickatabot sold lands to Mr. Pynchon, or who know where they were, to set out the bounds thereof\". Fifty years later, Chickatabot's grandson [[Josias Wampatuck]] brought a [[Aboriginal land claim|land claim]] against Medfield and the other towns created within the borders of the Chickatabot purchase, for which he received payment. Of those lands, Dedham was the first town formed.<ref>Tilden, W. S. (1887).

Quotation from the General Court, qtd. by Tilden.</ref>\n\n[[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] was incorporated in 1636, and Medfield (New Dedham) was first settled in 1649, principally by people who relocated from the former town. The first 13 house lots were laid out on June 19, 1650. In May 1651, the town was incorporated by an act of the General Court as the 43rd town in Massachusetts.<ref>Tilden, W. S.

The population is 12,024 according to the 2010 Census. It is a community about 17 miles southwest of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which is a 40-minute drive to Boston's financial district. Attractions include the Hinkley Pond and the Peak House.\n\n==History==\nThe territory that Medfield now occupies was, at the time of colonization, [[Neponset people|Neponset]] land. After the English took the Native Americans' land by force and spread a variety of diseases to the people, it was apparently sold by the Neponset leader [[Chickatabot]] to [[William Pynchon]] in the late 1620s. In 1633, however, Chickatabot died in a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] that decimated nearby Neponset, [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] and [[Pequot]] communities. Because Chickatabot and Pynchon's deal left no written deed, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] ordered \"those Indians who were present when Chickatabot sold lands to Mr. Pynchon, or who know where they were, to set out the bounds thereof\". Fifty years later, Chickatabot's grandson [[Josias Wampatuck]] brought a [[Aboriginal land claim|land claim]] against Medfield and the other towns created within the borders of the Chickatabot purchase, for which he received payment. Of those lands, Dedham was the first town formed.<ref>Tilden, W. S. (1887).
