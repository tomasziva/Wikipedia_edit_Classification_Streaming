There are five references to Lilith in the Babylonian Talmud in [[Gemara]] on three separate Tractates of the Mishnah:\n* \"Rab Judah citing [[Samuel]] ruled: If an abortion had the likeness of Lilith its [[mother]] is unclean by reason of the [[birth]], for it is a child but it has wings.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Nidda 24b)<ref>Tractate Niddah in the Mishnah is the only tractate from the Order of Tohorot which has Talmud on it. The Jerusalem Talmud is incomplete here, but the Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Niddah (2a\u201376b) is complete.</ref>\n* \"[Expounding upon the curses of womanhood] In a [[Baraitha]] it was taught: She grows long hair like Lilith, sits when making water like a beast, and serves as a bolster for her husband.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Eruvin 100b)\n* \"For gira he should take an arrow of Lilith and place it point upwards and pour water on it and drink it. Alternatively he can take water of which a dog has drunk at night, but he must take care that it has not been exposed.\" (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Gittin 69b). In this particular case, the \"arrow of Lilith\" is most probably a scrap of [[meteorite]] or a [[fulgurite]], colloquially known as \"petrified lightning\" and treated as antipyretic medicine.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*\"Rabbah said: I saw how Hormin the son of Lilith was running on the parapet of the wall of Mahuza, and a rider, galloping below on horseback could not overtake him. Once they saddled for him two mules which stood on two bridges of the Rognag; and he jumped from one to the other, backward and forward, holding in his hands two cups of wine, pouring alternately from one to the other, and not a drop fell to the ground.\" (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Bava Bathra 73a-b). Hormin who is mentioned here as the son of Lilith is most probably a result of a scribal error of the word \"Hormiz\" attested in some of the Talmudic manuscripts. The word itself in turn seems to a distortion of [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]], the [[Avesta|Zendavestan]] deity of light and goodness. If so, it is somewhat ironic that Ormuzd becomes here the son of a nocturnal demon.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*\"R. Hanina said: One may not sleep in a house alone [in a lonely house], and whoever sleeps in a house alone is seized by Lilith.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Shabbath 151b)\n\nThe above statement by Hanina may be related to the belief that nocturnal emissions engendered the birth of demons:\n* \"R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar further stated: In all those years [130 years after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden] during which Adam was under the ban he begot [[ghost]]s and male demons and female demons [or night demons], for it is said in Scripture: And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begot a son in own likeness, after his own image, from which it follows that until that time he did not beget after his own image ... When he saw that through him death was ordained as punishment he spent a hundred and thirty years in [[fasting]], severed connection with his wife for a hundred and thirty years, and wore clothes of [[ficus|fig]] on his body for a hundred and thirty years. \u2013 That statement [of R. Jeremiah] was made in reference to the [[semen]] which he emitted accidentally.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Eruvin 18b)\n\nThe [[Midrash Rabba]]h collection contains two references to Lilith. The first one is present in [[Genesis Rabbah]] 22:7 and 18:4: according to [[Hiyya the Great|Rabbi Hiyya]] God proceeded to create a second Eve for Adam, after Lilith had to return to dust.<ref name=aish-lillith>{{cite web|title=Lillith|url=http://www.aish.com/atr/Lillith.html|website=aish.com|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> However, to be exact the said passages do not employ the Heb. word ''lilith'' itself and instead speak of \"the first Eve\" (Heb. ''Chavvah ha-Rishonah'', analogically to the phrase ''Adam ha-Rishon'', i.e. the first Adam). Although in the medieval Hebrew literature and folklore, especially that reflected on the protective amulets of various kinds, ''Chavvah ha-Rishonah'' was identified with Lilith, one should remain careful in transposing this equation to the Late Antiquity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kosior|first=Wojciech|date=2018|title=A Tale of Two Sisters: The Image of Eve in Early Rabbinic Literature and Its Influence on the Portrayal of Lilith in the Alphabet of Ben Sira|url=https://www.academia.edu/36771379|journal=Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies & Gender Issues|volume=|issue=32|pages=112\u2013130|doi=10.2979/nashim.32.1.10|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe second mention of Lilith, this time explicit, is present in [[Numbers Rabbah]] 16:25.

Whether this particular tradition is older is not known. Scholars tend to date the Alphabet between the 8th and 10th centuries CE. The work has been characterized as [[satire|satirical]].\n\nIn the text an [[amulet]] is inscribed with the names of three [[angel]]s ([[Senoy]], [[Sansenoy]], and [[Semangelof]]) and placed around the neck of [[newborn]] [[boy]]s in order to protect them from the [[lilin]] until their [[circumcision]].<ref>Alphabet of Ben Sirah, Question #5 (23a\u2013b)</ref> The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this tradition are, in fact, dated as being much older.<ref>Humm, Alan. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/alphabet.html Lilith in the Alphabet of Ben Sira]</ref> The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to the Alphabet, and is not a new concept, as it can be found in [[Genesis Rabbah]]. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor may be exclusive to the Alphabet.\n\nThe idea in the text that [[Adam]] had a wife prior to [[Eve]] may have developed from an interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]] and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God's creation of Eve from Adam's rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\" The Alphabet text places Lilith's creation after God's words in Genesis 2:18 that \"it is not good for man to be alone\"; in this text God forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam but she and Adam bicker. Lilith claims that since she and Adam were created in the same way they were equal and she refuses to submit to him:\n\n<blockquote>After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, \"It is not good for man to be alone.\" He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, \"I will not lie below,\" and he said, \"I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.\" Lilith responded, \"We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.\" But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.\n\nAdam stood in prayer before his Creator: \"Sovereign of the universe!\" he said, \"the woman you gave me has run away.\" At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels [[Senoy]], [[Sansenoy]], and [[Semangelof]], to bring her back.\n\nSaid the Holy One to Adam, \"If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.\" The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, \"We shall drown you in the sea.\"\n\n\"Leave me!' she said. \"I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.\"\n\nWhen the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: \"Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.\" She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.</blockquote>\n\nThe background and purpose of ''The Alphabet of Ben-Sira'' is unclear. It is a collection of stories about heroes of the [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]], it may have been a collection of [[Folklore|folk-tale]]s, a refutation of [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]], or other separatist movements; its content seems so offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish [[satire]],<ref>Segal, Eliezer. [http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/950206_Lilith.html Looking for Lilith]</ref> although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany. In turn, other scholars argue that the target of the ''Alphabet's'' satire is very difficult to establish exactly because of the variety of the figures and values ridiculed therein: criticism is actually directed against Adam, who turns out to be weak and ineffective in his relations with his wife. Apparently, the first man is not the only male figure who is mocked: even God cannot subjugate Lilith and needs to ask his messengers, who only manage to go as far as negotiating the conditions of the agreement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Filippino Lippi- Adam.JPG|upright=1.3|thumb|right|[[Adam]] clutches a child in the presence of the child-snatcher Lilith. Fresco by [[Filippino Lippi]], basilica of [[Santa Maria Novella]], Florence]]\n\n''The Alphabet of Ben-Sira'' is the earliest surviving source of the story, and the conception that Lilith was Adam's first wife became only widely known with the 17th century ''[[Lexicon Talmudicum]]'' of German scholar [[Johannes Buxtorf]].\n\nIn this folk tradition that arose in the early Middle Ages Lilith, a dominant female demon, became identified with [[Asmodeus]], King of Demons, as his queen.<ref>Schwartz p.7</ref> Asmodeus was already well known by this time because of the legends about him in the Talmud. Thus, the merging of Lilith and Asmodeus was inevitable.<ref>Schwartz p 8</ref> The second myth of Lilith grew to include legends about another world and by some accounts this other world existed side by side with this one, ''Yenne Velt'' is Yiddish for this described \"Other World\". In this case Asmodeus and Lilith were believed to procreate demonic offspring endlessly and spread chaos at every turn.<ref name=\"Schwartz p.8\">Schwartz p.8</ref>\n\nTwo primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately; there is hardly a tale where she encompasses both roles.<ref name=\"Schwartz p.8\"/> But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft. Such stories are commonly found among Jewish folklore.<ref name=\"Schwartz p.8\"/>\n\n==== The influence of the rabbinic traditions ====\nAlthough the image of Lilith of the ''Alphabet of Ben Sira'' is unprecedented, some elements in her portrayal can be traced back to the talmudic and midrashic traditions that arose around [[Eve]]:\n\n# First and foremost, the very introduction of Lilith to the creation story rests on the rabbinic myth, prompted by the two separate creation accounts in Genesis 1:1\u20132:25, that there were two original women. A way of resolving the apparent discrepancy between these two accounts was to assume that there must have been some other first woman, apart from the one later identified with Eve. The Rabbis, noting Adam's exclamation, \"this time (''zot hapa\u2018am'') [this is] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh\" (Genesis 2:23), took it as an intimation that there must already have been a \"first time\". According to Genesis rabah 18:4, Adam was disgusted upon seeing the first woman full of \"discharge and blood\", and God had to provide him with another one. The subsequent creation is performed with adequate precautions: Adam is made to sleep, so as not to witness the process itself ( Sanhedrin 39a), and Eve is adorned with fine jewelry (Genesis rabah 18:1) and brought to Adam by the angels Gabriel and Michael (ibid. 18:3). However, nowhere do the rabbis specify what happened to the first woman, leaving the matter open for further speculation. This is the gap into which the later tradition of Lilith could fit.\n# Second, this new woman is still met with harsh rabbinic allegations. Again playing on the Heb. phrase ''zot hapa\u2018am'', Adam, according to the same midrash, declares: \"it is she [''zot''] who is destined to strike the bell [''zog''] and to speak [in strife] against me, as you read, 'a golden bell [''pa\u2018amon''] and a pomegranate' [Exodus 28:34]  ... it is she who will trouble me [''mefa\u2018amtani''] all night\" (Genesis Rabbah 18:4). The first woman also becomes the object of accusations ascribed to Rabbi Joshua of Siknin, according to whom Eve, despite the divine efforts, turned out to be \"swelled-headed, coquette, eavesdropper, gossip, prone to jealousy, light-fingered and gadabout\" (Genesis Rabbah 18:2). A similar set of charges appears in Genesis Rabbah 17:8, according to which Eve's creation from Adam's rib rather than from the earth makes her inferior to Adam and never satisfied with anything.\n# Third, and despite the terseness of the biblical text in this regard, the erotic iniquities attributed to Eve constitute a separate category of her shortcomings. Told in Genesis 3:16 that \"your desire shall be for your husband\", she is accused by the Rabbis of having an overdeveloped sexual drive (Genesis Rabhah 20:7) and constantly enticing Adam (Genesis Rabbab 23:5). However, in terms of textual popularity and dissemination, the motif of Eve copulating with the primeval serpent takes priority over her other sexual transgressions. Despite the rather unsettling picturesqueness of this account, it is conveyed in numerous places: Genesis Rabbah 18:6, and BT Sotah 9b, Shabbat 145b\u2013146a and 156a, Yevamot 103b and Avodah Zarah 22b.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Kabbalah===\n{{Kabbalah}}\n{{main|Lilith (Lurianic Kabbalah)}}\n[[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic mysticism]] attempted to establish a more exact relationship between Lilith and God. With her major characteristics having been well developed by the end of the Talmudic period, after six centuries had elapsed between the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[incantation]] texts that mention Lilith and the early Spanish Kabbalistic writings in the 13th century, she reappears, and her life history becomes known in greater mythological detail.<ref>Patai pp. 229\u2013230</ref>\n\nHer creation is described in many alternative versions. One mentions her creation as being before Adam's, on the fifth day, because the \"living creatures\" with whose swarms God filled the waters included Lilith. A similar version, related to the earlier Talmudic passages, recounts how Lilith was fashioned with the same substance as Adam was, shortly before. A third alternative version states that God originally created Adam and Lilith in a manner that the female creature was contained in the male. Lilith's soul was lodged in the depths of the Great Abyss. When God called her, she joined Adam. After Adam's body was created a thousand [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s from the Left (evil) side attempted to attach themselves to him. However, God drove them off. Adam was left lying as a body without a soul. Then a cloud descended and God commanded the [[earth]] to produce a living soul. This God [[breath]]ed into Adam, who began to spring to life and his female was attached to his side. God separated the female from Adam's side. The female side was Lilith, whereupon she flew to the Cities of the Sea and attacked [[humankind]]. Yet another version claims that Lilith emerged as a divine entity that was born spontaneously, either out of the Great Supernal Abyss or out of the power of an aspect of God (the [[Gevurah|Gevurah of Din]]). This aspect of God, one of his ten attributes (Sefirot), at its lowest manifestation has an affinity with the realm of evil and it is out of this that Lilith merged with [[Samael]].<ref>Patai p.230</ref>\n\nAn alternative story links Lilith with the creation of luminaries. The \"first light\", which is the light of Mercy (one of the [[Sefirot]]), appeared on the first day of creation when God said \"Let there be light\". This light became hidden and the Holiness became surrounded by a husk of evil. \"A husk (klippa) was created around the [[Human brain|brain]]\" and this husk spread and brought out another husk, which was Lilith.<ref>Patai p. 231</ref>\n\n====Midrash ABKIR====\nThe first medieval source to depict Adam and Lilith in full was the [[Midrash Abkir|Midrash A.B.K.I.R.]] (c. 10th century), which was followed by the Zohar and Kabbalistic writings. Adam is said to be perfect until he recognizes either his sin or Cain's fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world. He then separates from holy Eve, sleeps alone, and fasts for 130 years. During this time Lilith, or maybe a daughter of hers named Pizna, desires his beauty and comes to him against his will. She gives birth to multitudes of [[djinn]]s and demons, the first of them being named Agrimas. However, they are defeated by [[Methuselah]], who slays thousands of them with a holy sword and forces Agrimas to give him the names of the rest, after which he casts them away to the sea and the mountains.<ref>Geoffrey W. Dennis, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic and Mysticism: Second Edition''</ref>\n\n===Treatise on the Left Emanation===\n{{Main|Treatise on the Left Emanation}}\nThe mystical writing of two brothers Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, ''[[Treatise on the Left Emanation]]'', which predates the [[Zohar]] by a few decades, states that [[Samael]] and Lilith are in the shape of an [[androgynous]] being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the Throne of Glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a [[hermaphrodite]]. The two twin androgynous couples resembled each other and both \"were like the image of Above\"; that is, that they are reproduced in a visible form of an androgynous deity.\n\n<blockquote>19. In answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces.<ref>Patai p.231</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother version<ref name=shed>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13523-shedim Jewish Encyclopedia demonology]</ref> that was also current among Kabbalistic circles in the [[Middle Ages]] establishes Lilith as the first of Samael's four wives: Lilith, [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]], [[Eisheth]], and [[Agrat bat Mahlat]]. Each of them are mothers of demons and have their own hosts and unclean spirits in no number.<ref>Patai p. 244</ref> The marriage of [[archangel]] [[Samael]] and Lilith was arranged by [[Tanin'iver|\"Blind Dragon\"]], who is the counterpart of \"the dragon that is in the sea\". Blind Dragon acts as an intermediary between Lilith and Samael:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Dragon rides Lilith the Sinful \u2013 may she be extirpated quickly in our days, Amen! \u2013 And this Blind Dragon brings about the union between Samael and Lilith. And just as the Dragon that is in the sea (Isa. 27:1) has no eyes, likewise Blind Dragon that is above, in the likeness of a spiritual form, is without eyes, that is to say, without colors. ... (Patai 81:458) Samael is called the Slant Serpent, and Lilith is called the Tortuous Serpent.<ref>Humm, Alan. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/lilsam.html Lilith, Samael, & Blind Dragon]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe marriage of Samael and Lilith is known as the \"Angel Satan\" or the \"Other God\", but it was not allowed to last. To prevent Lilith and Samael's demonic children ''Lilin'' from filling the world, God [[Castration|castrated]] Samael. In many 17th century Kabbalistic books, this seems to be a reinterpretation of an old Talmudic myth where God castrated the male [[Leviathan]] and slew the female Leviathan in order to prevent them from mating and thereby destroying the Earth with their offspring.<ref>Patai p. 246</ref> With Lilith being unable to fornicate with Samael anymore, she sought to couple with men who experience nocturnal emissions. A 15th or 16th century Kabbalah text states that God has \"cooled\" the female Leviathan, meaning that he has made Lilith infertile and she is a mere fornication.\n\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of Man - WGA05250.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Fall of Man'' by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] (1592), showing the serpent in the Garden of Eden as a woman.]]\n\nThe ''Treatise on the Left Emanation'' also says that there are two Liliths, the lesser being married to the great demon [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]].\n\n<blockquote>The Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni.

And the Serpent seduced Holy Eve, and enough said for him who understands. And all this ruination came about because Adam the first man coupled with Eve while she was in her menstrual impurity \u2013 this is the filth and the impure seed of the Serpent who mounted Eve before Adam mounted her. Behold, here it is before you: because of the sins of Adam the first man all the things mentioned came into being. For Evil Lilith, when she saw the greatness of his corruption, became strong in her husks, and came to Adam against his will, and became hot from him and bore him many demons and spirits and Lilin. (Patai81:455f)\n</blockquote>\n\n===Zohar===\nReferences to Lilith in the [[Zohar]] include the following:\n\n<blockquote>She wanders about at night, vexing the sons of men and causing them to defile themselves (19b)</blockquote>\n\nThis passage may be related to the mention of Lilith in Talmud Shabbath 151b (see above), and also to Talmud Eruvin 18b where nocturnal emissions are connected with the begettal of demons.\n\nRaphael Patai states that older sources state clearly that after Lilith's Red Sea sojourn (mentioned also in [[Louis Ginzberg]]'s ''Legends of the Jews''), she returned to Adam and begat children from him. In the Zohar, however, Lilith is said to have succeeded in begetting offspring from Adam during their short-lived sexual experience. Lilith leaves Adam in Eden, as she is not a suitable helpmate for him. She returns, later, to force herself upon him. However, before doing so she attaches herself to Cain and bears him numerous spirits and demons.<ref name=\"Patai p232\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Gershom Scholem]], the author of the Zohar, [[Rabbi Moses de Leon]], was aware of the folk tradition of Lilith. He was also aware of another story, possibly older, that may be conflicting.<ref>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, p. 174</ref> According to the Zohar, two female spirits, Lilith and [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]] \u2014 found Adam, desired his beauty which was like that of the sun disk, and lay with him.

The lami\u00e6, the strig\u00e6, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand by the name of vampires; even were it to be owned that these lami\u00e6 and strig\u00e6 have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.\n\nI own that these terms [''lami\u00e6'' and ''strig\u00e6''] are found in the versions of Holy Scripture. For instance, Isaiah, describing the condition to which Babylon was to be reduced after her ruin, says that she shall become the abode of satyrs, lami\u00e6, and strig\u00e6 (in Hebrew, lilith). This last term, according to the Hebrews, signifies the same thing, as the Greeks express by strix and lami\u00e6, which are sorceresses or magicians, who seek to put to death new-born children. Whence it comes that the Jews are accustomed to write in the four corners of the chamber of a woman just delivered, \"Adam, Eve, be gone from hence lilith.\" ... The ancient Greeks knew these dangerous sorceresses by the name of lami\u00e6, and they believed that they devoured children, or sucked away all their blood till they died.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustine|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al.

She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body from the waist up and a serpentine body from the waist down.<ref>Hurwitz p. 43</ref> One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess [[Hecate]]. Another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them.<ref name=\"Hurwitz p.43\">Hurwitz p.43</ref> Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men's blood.<ref>Hurwitz p.78</ref> Her gift was the \"mark of a Sibyl\", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was \"cursed\" to never be able to shut her eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children.

Accompanying his ''Lady Lilith'' painting from 1866, Rossetti wrote a [[sonnet]] entitled ''Lilith'', which was first published in Swinburne's pamphlet-review (1868), ''Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition''.\n\n{{poemquote|Of Adam's first wife, Lilith, it is told\n(The witch he loved before the gift of Eve,)\nThat, ere the snake's, her sweet tongue could deceive,\nAnd her enchanted hair was the first gold.\nAnd still she sits, young while the earth is old,\nAnd, subtly of herself contemplative,\nDraws men to watch the bright web she can weave,\nTill heart and body and life are in its hold.\nThe rose and poppy are her flower; for where\nIs he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent\nAnd soft-shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?\nLo!

MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology are present in the author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing at herself in a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.\n\nAustralian poet and scholar [[Christopher John Brennan]] (1870\u20131932), included a section titled \"Lilith\" in his major work \"Poems: 1913\" (Sydney : G.

Moore]]'s 1940 story ''Fruit of Knowledge'' is written from Lilith's point of view. It is a re-telling of the [[Fall of Man]] as a [[love triangle]] between Lilith, Adam and Eve \u2013 with Eve's eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam's love.\n\nBritish poet [[John Siddique]]'s 2011 collection ''Full Blood'' has a suite of 11 poems called ''The Tree of Life'', which features Lilith as the divine feminine aspect of God.

There are five references to Lilith in the Babylonian Talmud in [[Gemara]] on three separate Tractates of the Mishnah:\n* \"Rab Judah citing [[Samuel]] ruled: If an abortion had the likeness of Lilith its [[mother]] is unclean by reason of the [[birth]], for it is a child but it has wings.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Nidda 24b)<ref>Tractate Niddah in the Mishnah is the only tractate from the Order of Tohorot which has Talmud on it. The Jerusalem Talmud is incomplete here, but the Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Niddah (2a\u201376b) is complete.</ref>\n* \"[Expounding upon the curses of womanhood] In a [[Baraitha]] it was taught: She grows long hair like Lilith, sits when making water like a beast, and serves as a bolster for her husband.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Eruvin 100b)\n* \"For gira he should take an arrow of Lilith and place it point upwards and pour water on it and drink it. Alternatively he can take water of which a dog has drunk at night, but he must take care that it has not been exposed.\" (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Gittin 69b). In this particular case, the \"arrow of Lilith\" is most probably a scrap of [[meteorite]] or a [[fulgurite]], colloquially known as \"petrified lightning\" and treated as antipyretic medicine.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*\"Rabbah said: I saw how Hormin the son of Lilith was running on the parapet of the wall of Mahuza, and a rider, galloping below on horseback could not overtake him. Once they saddled for him two mules which stood on two bridges of the Rognag; and he jumped from one to the other, backward and forward, holding in his hands two cups of wine, pouring alternately from one to the other, and not a drop fell to the ground.\" (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Bava Bathra 73a-b). Hormin who is mentioned here as the son of Lilith is most probably a result of a scribal error of the word \"Hormiz\" attested in some of the Talmudic manuscripts. The word itself in turn seems to a distortion of [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]], the [[Avesta|Zendavestan]] deity of light and goodness. If so, it is somewhat ironic that Ormuzd becomes here the son of a nocturnal demon.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*\"R. Hanina said: One may not sleep in a house alone [in a lonely house], and whoever sleeps in a house alone is seized by Lilith.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Shabbath 151b)\n\nThe above statement by Hanina may be related to the belief that nocturnal emissions engendered the birth of demons:\n* \"R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar further stated: In all those years [130 years after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden] during which Adam was under the ban he begot [[ghost]]s and male demons and female demons [or night demons], for it is said in Scripture: And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years and begot a son in own likeness, after his own image, from which it follows that until that time he did not beget after his own image ... When he saw that through him death was ordained as punishment he spent a hundred and thirty years in [[fasting]], severed connection with his wife for a hundred and thirty years, and wore clothes of [[ficus|fig]] on his body for a hundred and thirty years. \u2013 That statement [of R. Jeremiah] was made in reference to the [[semen]] which he emitted accidentally.\" (Babylonian Talmud on Tractate Eruvin 18b)\n\nThe [[Midrash Rabba]]h collection contains two references to Lilith. The first one is present in [[Genesis Rabbah]] 22:7 and 18:4: according to [[Hiyya the Great|Rabbi Hiyya]] God proceeded to create a second Eve for Adam, after Lilith had to return to dust.<ref name=aish-lillith>{{cite web|title=Lillith|url=http://www.aish.com/atr/Lillith.html|website=aish.com|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> However, to be exact the said passages do not employ the Heb. word ''lilith'' itself and instead speak of \"the first Eve\" (Heb. ''Chavvah ha-Rishonah'', analogically to the phrase ''Adam ha-Rishon'', i.e. the first Adam). Although in the medieval Hebrew literature and folklore, especially that reflected on the protective amulets of various kinds, ''Chavvah ha-Rishonah'' was identified with Lilith, one should remain careful in transposing this equation to the Late Antiquity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kosior|first=Wojciech|date=2018|title=A Tale of Two Sisters: The Image of Eve in Early Rabbinic Literature and Its Influence on the Portrayal of Lilith in the Alphabet of Ben Sira|url=https://www.academia.edu/36771379|journal=Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies & Gender Issues|volume=|issue=32|pages=112\u2013130|doi=10.2979/nashim.32.1.10|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe second mention of Lilith, this time explicit, is present in [[Numbers Rabbah]] 16:25.

Whether this particular tradition is older is not known. Scholars tend to date the Alphabet between the 8th and 10th centuries CE. The work has been characterized as [[satire|satirical]].\n\nIn the text an [[amulet]] is inscribed with the names of three [[angel]]s ([[Senoy]], [[Sansenoy]], and [[Semangelof]]) and placed around the neck of [[newborn]] [[boy]]s in order to protect them from the [[lilin]] until their [[circumcision]].<ref>Alphabet of Ben Sirah, Question #5 (23a\u2013b)</ref> The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this tradition are, in fact, dated as being much older.<ref>Humm, Alan. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/alphabet.html Lilith in the Alphabet of Ben Sira]</ref> The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to the Alphabet, and is not a new concept, as it can be found in [[Genesis Rabbah]]. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor may be exclusive to the Alphabet.\n\nThe idea in the text that [[Adam]] had a wife prior to [[Eve]] may have developed from an interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]] and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God's creation of Eve from Adam's rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\" The Alphabet text places Lilith's creation after God's words in Genesis 2:18 that \"it is not good for man to be alone\"; in this text God forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam but she and Adam bicker. Lilith claims that since she and Adam were created in the same way they were equal and she refuses to submit to him:\n\n<blockquote>After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, \"It is not good for man to be alone.\" He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, \"I will not lie below,\" and he said, \"I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.\" Lilith responded, \"We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.\" But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.\n\nAdam stood in prayer before his Creator: \"Sovereign of the universe!\" he said, \"the woman you gave me has run away.\" At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels [[Senoy]], [[Sansenoy]], and [[Semangelof]], to bring her back.\n\nSaid the Holy One to Adam, \"If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.\" The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, \"We shall drown you in the sea.\"\n\n\"Leave me!' she said. \"I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.\"\n\nWhen the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: \"Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.\" She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.</blockquote>\n\nThe background and purpose of ''The Alphabet of Ben-Sira'' is unclear. It is a collection of stories about heroes of the [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]], it may have been a collection of [[Folklore|folk-tale]]s, a refutation of [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]], or other separatist movements; its content seems so offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish [[satire]],<ref>Segal, Eliezer. [http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/950206_Lilith.html Looking for Lilith]</ref> although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany. In turn, other scholars argue that the target of the ''Alphabet's'' satire is very difficult to establish exactly because of the variety of the figures and values ridiculed therein: criticism is actually directed against Adam, who turns out to be weak and ineffective in his relations with his wife. Apparently, the first man is not the only male figure who is mocked: even God cannot subjugate Lilith and needs to ask his messengers, who only manage to go as far as negotiating the conditions of the agreement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Filippino Lippi- Adam.JPG|upright=1.3|thumb|right|[[Adam]] clutches a child in the presence of the child-snatcher Lilith. Fresco by [[Filippino Lippi]], basilica of [[Santa Maria Novella]], Florence]]\n\n''The Alphabet of Ben-Sira'' is the earliest surviving source of the story, and the conception that Lilith was Adam's first wife became only widely known with the 17th century ''[[Lexicon Talmudicum]]'' of German scholar [[Johannes Buxtorf]].\n\nIn this folk tradition that arose in the early Middle Ages Lilith, a dominant female demon, became identified with [[Asmodeus]], King of Demons, as his queen.<ref>Schwartz p.7</ref> Asmodeus was already well known by this time because of the legends about him in the Talmud. Thus, the merging of Lilith and Asmodeus was inevitable.<ref>Schwartz p 8</ref> The second myth of Lilith grew to include legends about another world and by some accounts this other world existed side by side with this one, ''Yenne Velt'' is Yiddish for this described \"Other World\". In this case Asmodeus and Lilith were believed to procreate demonic offspring endlessly and spread chaos at every turn.<ref name=\"Schwartz p.8\">Schwartz p.8</ref>\n\nTwo primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately; there is hardly a tale where she encompasses both roles.<ref name=\"Schwartz p.8\"/> But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft. Such stories are commonly found among Jewish folklore.<ref name=\"Schwartz p.8\"/>\n\n==== The influence of the rabbinic traditions ====\nAlthough the image of Lilith of the ''Alphabet of Ben Sira'' is unprecedented, some elements in her portrayal can be traced back to the talmudic and midrashic traditions that arose around [[Eve]]:\n\n# First and foremost, the very introduction of Lilith to the creation story rests on the rabbinic myth, prompted by the two separate creation accounts in Genesis 1:1\u20132:25, that there were two original women. A way of resolving the apparent discrepancy between these two accounts was to assume that there must have been some other first woman, apart from the one later identified with Eve. The Rabbis, noting Adam's exclamation, \"this time (''zot hapa\u2018am'') [this is] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh\" (Genesis 2:23), took it as an intimation that there must already have been a \"first time\". According to Genesis rabah 18:4, Adam was disgusted upon seeing the first woman full of \"discharge and blood\", and God had to provide him with another one. The subsequent creation is performed with adequate precautions: Adam is made to sleep, so as not to witness the process itself ( Sanhedrin 39a), and Eve is adorned with fine jewelry (Genesis rabah 18:1) and brought to Adam by the angels Gabriel and Michael (ibid. 18:3). However, nowhere do the rabbis specify what happened to the first woman, leaving the matter open for further speculation. This is the gap into which the later tradition of Lilith could fit.\n# Second, this new woman is still met with harsh rabbinic allegations. Again playing on the Heb. phrase ''zot hapa\u2018am'', Adam, according to the same midrash, declares: \"it is she [''zot''] who is destined to strike the bell [''zog''] and to speak [in strife] against me, as you read, 'a golden bell [''pa\u2018amon''] and a pomegranate' [Exodus 28:34]  ... it is she who will trouble me [''mefa\u2018amtani''] all night\" (Genesis Rabbah 18:4). The first woman also becomes the object of accusations ascribed to Rabbi Joshua of Siknin, according to whom Eve, despite the divine efforts, turned out to be \"swelled-headed, coquette, eavesdropper, gossip, prone to jealousy, light-fingered and gadabout\" (Genesis Rabbah 18:2). A similar set of charges appears in Genesis Rabbah 17:8, according to which Eve's creation from Adam's rib rather than from the earth makes her inferior to Adam and never satisfied with anything.\n# Third, and despite the terseness of the biblical text in this regard, the erotic iniquities attributed to Eve constitute a separate category of her shortcomings. Told in Genesis 3:16 that \"your desire shall be for your husband\", she is accused by the Rabbis of having an overdeveloped sexual drive (Genesis Rabhah 20:7) and constantly enticing Adam (Genesis Rabbab 23:5). However, in terms of textual popularity and dissemination, the motif of Eve copulating with the primeval serpent takes priority over her other sexual transgressions. Despite the rather unsettling picturesqueness of this account, it is conveyed in numerous places: Genesis Rabbah 18:6, and BT Sotah 9b, Shabbat 145b\u2013146a and 156a, Yevamot 103b and Avodah Zarah 22b.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Kabbalah===\n{{Kabbalah}}\n{{main|Lilith (Lurianic Kabbalah)}}\n[[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic mysticism]] attempted to establish a more exact relationship between Lilith and God. With her major characteristics having been well developed by the end of the Talmudic period, after six centuries had elapsed between the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[incantation]] texts that mention Lilith and the early Spanish Kabbalistic writings in the 13th century, she reappears, and her life history becomes known in greater mythological detail.<ref>Patai pp. 229\u2013230</ref>\n\nHer creation is described in many alternative versions. One mentions her creation as being before Adam's, on the fifth day, because the \"living creatures\" with whose swarms God filled the waters included Lilith. A similar version, related to the earlier Talmudic passages, recounts how Lilith was fashioned with the same substance as Adam was, shortly before. A third alternative version states that God originally created Adam and Lilith in a manner that the female creature was contained in the male. Lilith's soul was lodged in the depths of the Great Abyss. When God called her, she joined Adam. After Adam's body was created a thousand [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s from the Left (evil) side attempted to attach themselves to him. However, God drove them off. Adam was left lying as a body without a soul. Then a cloud descended and God commanded the [[earth]] to produce a living soul. This God [[breath]]ed into Adam, who began to spring to life and his female was attached to his side. God separated the female from Adam's side. The female side was Lilith, whereupon she flew to the Cities of the Sea and attacked [[humankind]]. Yet another version claims that Lilith emerged as a divine entity that was born spontaneously, either out of the Great Supernal Abyss or out of the power of an aspect of God (the [[Gevurah|Gevurah of Din]]). This aspect of God, one of his ten attributes (Sefirot), at its lowest manifestation has an affinity with the realm of evil and it is out of this that Lilith merged with [[Samael]].<ref>Patai p.230</ref>\n\nAn alternative story links Lilith with the creation of luminaries. The \"first light\", which is the light of Mercy (one of the [[Sefirot]]), appeared on the first day of creation when God said \"Let there be light\". This light became hidden and the Holiness became surrounded by a husk of evil. \"A husk (klippa) was created around the [[Human brain|brain]]\" and this husk spread and brought out another husk, which was Lilith.<ref>Patai p. 231</ref>\n\n====Midrash ABKIR====\nThe first medieval source to depict Adam and Lilith in full was the [[Midrash Abkir|Midrash A.B.K.I.R.]] (c. 10th century), which was followed by the Zohar and Kabbalistic writings. Adam is said to be perfect until he recognizes either his sin or Cain's fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world. He then separates from holy Eve, sleeps alone, and fasts for 130 years. During this time Lilith, or maybe a daughter of hers named Pizna, desires his beauty and comes to him against his will. She gives birth to multitudes of [[djinn]]s and demons, the first of them being named Agrimas. However, they are defeated by [[Methuselah]], who slays thousands of them with a holy sword and forces Agrimas to give him the names of the rest, after which he casts them away to the sea and the mountains.<ref>Geoffrey W. Dennis, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic and Mysticism: Second Edition''</ref>\n\n===Treatise on the Left Emanation===\n{{Main|Treatise on the Left Emanation}}\nThe mystical writing of two brothers Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, ''[[Treatise on the Left Emanation]]'', which predates the [[Zohar]] by a few decades, states that [[Samael]] and Lilith are in the shape of an [[androgynous]] being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the Throne of Glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a [[hermaphrodite]]. The two twin androgynous couples resembled each other and both \"were like the image of Above\"; that is, that they are reproduced in a visible form of an androgynous deity.\n\n<blockquote>19. In answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces.<ref>Patai p.231</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother version<ref name=shed>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13523-shedim Jewish Encyclopedia demonology]</ref> that was also current among Kabbalistic circles in the [[Middle Ages]] establishes Lilith as the first of Samael's four wives: Lilith, [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]], [[Eisheth]], and [[Agrat bat Mahlat]]. Each of them are mothers of demons and have their own hosts and unclean spirits in no number.<ref>Patai p. 244</ref> The marriage of [[archangel]] [[Samael]] and Lilith was arranged by [[Tanin'iver|\"Blind Dragon\"]], who is the counterpart of \"the dragon that is in the sea\". Blind Dragon acts as an intermediary between Lilith and Samael:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Dragon rides Lilith the Sinful \u2013 may she be extirpated quickly in our days, Amen! \u2013 And this Blind Dragon brings about the union between Samael and Lilith. And just as the Dragon that is in the sea (Isa. 27:1) has no eyes, likewise Blind Dragon that is above, in the likeness of a spiritual form, is without eyes, that is to say, without colors. ... (Patai 81:458) Samael is called the Slant Serpent, and Lilith is called the Tortuous Serpent.<ref>Humm, Alan. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/lilsam.html Lilith, Samael, & Blind Dragon]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe marriage of Samael and Lilith is known as the \"Angel Satan\" or the \"Other God\", but it was not allowed to last. To prevent Lilith and Samael's demonic children ''Lilin'' from filling the world, God [[Castration|castrated]] Samael. In many 17th century Kabbalistic books, this seems to be a reinterpretation of an old Talmudic myth where God castrated the male [[Leviathan]] and slew the female Leviathan in order to prevent them from mating and thereby destroying the Earth with their offspring.<ref>Patai p. 246</ref> With Lilith being unable to fornicate with Samael anymore, she sought to couple with men who experience nocturnal emissions. A 15th or 16th century Kabbalah text states that God has \"cooled\" the female Leviathan, meaning that he has made Lilith infertile and she is a mere fornication.\n\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of Man - WGA05250.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Fall of Man'' by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] (1592), showing the serpent in the Garden of Eden as a woman.]]\n\nThe ''Treatise on the Left Emanation'' also says that there are two Liliths, the lesser being married to the great demon [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]].\n\n<blockquote>The Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni. The name of his mate is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, and their daughter is Lilith.<ref>R. Isaac b. Jacob Ha-Kohen. [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/Lilith/jacob_ha_kohen.html Lilith in Jewish Mysticism: Treatise on the Left Emanation]</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother passage charges Lilith as being a tempting serpent of [[Eve]].\n\n<blockquote>\nAnd the Serpent, the Woman of Harlotry, incited and seduced Eve through the husks of Light which in itself is holiness. And the Serpent seduced Holy Eve, and enough said for him who understands. And all this ruination came about because Adam the first man coupled with Eve while she was in her menstrual impurity \u2013 this is the filth and the impure seed of the Serpent who mounted Eve before Adam mounted her. Behold, here it is before you: because of the sins of Adam the first man all the things mentioned came into being. For Evil Lilith, when she saw the greatness of his corruption, became strong in her husks, and came to Adam against his will, and became hot from him and bore him many demons and spirits and Lilin. (Patai81:455f)\n</blockquote>\n\n===Zohar===\nReferences to Lilith in the [[Zohar]] include the following:\n\n<blockquote>She wanders about at night, vexing the sons of men and causing them to defile themselves (19b)</blockquote>\n\nThis passage may be related to the mention of Lilith in Talmud Shabbath 151b (see above), and also to Talmud Eruvin 18b where nocturnal emissions are connected with the begettal of demons.\n\nRaphael Patai states that older sources state clearly that after Lilith's Red Sea sojourn (mentioned also in [[Louis Ginzberg]]'s ''Legends of the Jews''), she returned to Adam and begat children from him. In the Zohar, however, Lilith is said to have succeeded in begetting offspring from Adam during their short-lived sexual experience. Lilith leaves Adam in Eden, as she is not a suitable helpmate for him. She returns, later, to force herself upon him. However, before doing so she attaches herself to Cain and bears him numerous spirits and demons.<ref name=\"Patai p232\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Gershom Scholem]], the author of the Zohar, [[Rabbi Moses de Leon]], was aware of the folk tradition of Lilith. He was also aware of another story, possibly older, that may be conflicting.<ref>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, p. 174</ref> According to the Zohar, two female spirits, Lilith and [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]] \u2014 found Adam, desired his beauty which was like that of the sun disk, and lay with him. The issue of these unions were demons and spirits called \"the plagues of humankind\".<ref name=\"Patai p232\">Patai p232 \"Or according to the Zohar, two female spirits, Lilith and Naamah \u2014 found him, desired his beauty which was like that of the sun disk, and lay with him.

Wellcome M0008070.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval Hebrew amulet intended to protect a mother and her child from Lilith]]\n\nA copy of [[Jean de Pauly]]'s translation of the Zohar in the [[Ritman Library]] contains an inserted late 17th Century printed Hebrew sheet for use in magical amulets where the prophet [[Elijah]] confronts Lilith.<ref>\"Printed sheet, late 17th century or early 18th century, 185x130 mm.</ref>\n\nThe sheet contains two texts within borders, which are amulets, one for a male ('lazakhar'), the other one for a female ('lanekevah').

A few lines in Yiddish are followed by the dialogue between the prophet Elijah and Lilith when he met her with her host of demons to kill the mother and take her new-born child ('to drink her blood, suck her bones and eat her flesh'). She tells Elijah that she will lose her power if someone uses her secret names, which she reveals at the end: ''lilith, abitu, abizu, hakash, avers hikpodu, ayalu, matrota ...''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ritmanlibrary.nl/c/p/exh/kabb/kab_pheb_25.html |title=Lilith Amulet-J.R.

The lami\u00e6, the strig\u00e6, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand by the name of vampires; even were it to be owned that these lami\u00e6 and strig\u00e6 have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.\n\nI own that these terms [''lami\u00e6'' and ''strig\u00e6''] are found in the versions of Holy Scripture. For instance, Isaiah, describing the condition to which Babylon was to be reduced after her ruin, says that she shall become the abode of satyrs, lami\u00e6, and strig\u00e6 (in Hebrew, lilith). This last term, according to the Hebrews, signifies the same thing, as the Greeks express by strix and lami\u00e6, which are sorceresses or magicians, who seek to put to death new-born children. Whence it comes that the Jews are accustomed to write in the four corners of the chamber of a woman just delivered, \"Adam, Eve, be gone from hence lilith.\" ... The ancient Greeks knew these dangerous sorceresses by the name of lami\u00e6, and they believed that they devoured children, or sucked away all their blood till they died.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustine|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al.

Lamia bore the title \"child killer\" and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body from the waist up and a serpentine body from the waist down.<ref>Hurwitz p. 43</ref> One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess [[Hecate]]. Another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them.<ref name=\"Hurwitz p.43\">Hurwitz p.43</ref> Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men's blood.<ref>Hurwitz p.78</ref> Her gift was the \"mark of a Sibyl\", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was \"cursed\" to never be able to shut her eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, [[Zeus]] gave her the ability to remove and replace her eyes from their sockets.<ref name=\"Hurwitz p.43\"/>\n\n==Arabic literature==\nLilith is not found in the [[Quran]] or [[Hadith]].

MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology are present in the author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing at herself in a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.\n\nAustralian poet and scholar [[Christopher John Brennan]] (1870\u20131932), included a section titled \"Lilith\" in his major work \"Poems: 1913\" (Sydney : G.

Moore]]'s 1940 story ''Fruit of Knowledge'' is written from Lilith's point of view. It is a re-telling of the [[Fall of Man]] as a [[love triangle]] between Lilith, Adam and Eve \u2013 with Eve's eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam's love.\n\nBritish poet [[John Siddique]]'s 2011 collection ''Full Blood'' has a suite of 11 poems called ''The Tree of Life'', which features Lilith as the divine feminine aspect of God.

Two organizations that use initiations and magic associated with Lilith are the [[Ordo Antichristianus Illuminati]] and the [[Order of Phosphorus]]. Lilith appears as a [[succubus]] in [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''De Arte Magica.'' Lilith was also one of the middle names of Crowley's first child, Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley (1904\u20131906), and Lilith is sometimes identified with [[Babalon]] in [[Thelema|Thelemic]] writings. Many early occult writers that contributed to modern day [[Wicca]] expressed special reverence for Lilith. [[Charles Leland]] associated [[Aradia (goddess)|Aradia]] with Lilith: [[Aradia (goddess)|Aradia]], says Leland, is [[Herodias]], who was regarded in [[stregheria]] folklore as being associated with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] as chief of the witches. Leland further notes that Herodias is a name that comes from West Asia, where it denoted an early form of Lilith.<ref>Grimassi, Raven.[http://www.stregheria.com/Marguerite.htm Stregheria: La Vecchia Religione]</ref><ref>Leland, Charles.[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/aradia/ara18.htm Aradia, Gospel of the Witches-aAppendix]</ref>\n\n[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] asserted that there was continuous historical worship of Lilith to present day, and that her name is sometimes given to the [[goddess]] being personified in the coven by the priestess. This idea was further attested by [[Doreen Valiente]], who cited her as a presiding goddess of the Craft: \"the personification of erotic dreams, the suppressed desire for delights\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/lillith.htm |title=Lilith-The First Eve |publisher=Imbolc |year=2002 }}</ref> In some contemporary concepts, ''Lilith'' is viewed as the embodiment of [[Goddess movement|the Goddess]], a designation that is thought to be shared with what these faiths believe to be her counterparts: [[Inanna]], [[Ishtar]], [[Asherah]], [[Anath]] and [[Isis]].<ref>Grenn, Deborah J.[http://www.lilithinstitute.com/history.htm History of Lilith Institute]</ref> According to one view, Lilith was originally a Sumerian, Babylonian, or Hebrew mother goddess of childbirth, children, women, and sexuality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daimon.ch/385630522X_2E.htm |title=Excerpts from Lilith-The first Eve |last=Hurwitz |first=Siegmund }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goddess.com.au/goddesses/Lilith.htm |publisher=goddess.com.au |title=Lilith |access-date=2018-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504094448/http://www.goddess.com.au/goddesses/Lilith.htm |archive-date=2018-05-04 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Raymond Buckland]] hold that Lilith is a dark moon goddess on par with the Hindu [[Kali]].<ref>[[Raymond Buckland]], ''The Witch Book'', Visible Ink Press, November 1, 2001.</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nMany modern [[theistic Satanists]] consider Lilith as a [[goddess]]. She is considered a goddess of independence by those Satanists and is often worshipped by women, but women are not the only people who worship her. Lilith is popular among theistic Satanists because of her association with Satan. Some Satanists believe that she is the wife of Satan and thus think of her as a mother figure. Others base their reverence towards her based on her history as a succubus and praise her as a sex goddess.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/rituals/standard/Lilith.html|title=Lilith and the modern Western world|website=theisticsatanism.com|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref> A different approach to a Satanic Lilith holds that she was once a fertility and agricultural goddess.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://religion.lilithezine.com/The_Legend_of_Lilith.html|title=The Legend of Lilith \u2013 The Religion eZine|website=religion.lilithezine.com|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Modern Kabbalah and Western mystery tradition==\nThe [[western mystery tradition]] associates Lilith with the [[Qliphoth]] of kabbalah.
