One of the main differences is in the way that word-initial vowels are written.\n\nIn Arabic, /in/ is (\u0625\u0646); in Jawi (Malay), it is (\u0627\u0646). In Tausug, it is (\u0626\u0650\u0646). The Tausug Arabic script utilises the letter y\u0101' with a hamza (\u0626) to represent a short vowel. If a kasra (\u0626\u0650) is added, it becomes an 'i' sound. If a fatha (\u0626\u064e) is added, it becomes an 'a' sound. If a damma (\u0626\u064f) is added, it becomes a 'u' sound.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Tausug Alphabet \u2013 Arabic Script\n|- style=\"font-size:small\"\n!

The Taus\u016bg language was previously written with the Arabic alphabet. The script used was inspired by the use of [[Jawi script|Jawi]] in writing the [[Malay language]].\n\nAn example of the Arabic alphabet in writing the Taus\u016bg language:\n* '''Latin script''' \u2013 Wayruun tuhan malaingkan All\u0101h, hi Muhammad ing ras\u016bl sin All\u0101h\n* '''Arabic script''' \u2013 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0640\u0631\u064f\u0677\u0646\u0652 \u062a\u064f\u0640\u0647\u064e\u0640\u0646\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0640\u0644\u064e\u0640\u064a\u0650\u0640\u06a0\u0652\u0640\u0643\u064e\u0640\u0646 \u0647\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0647\u0650\u0640\u0645\u064f\u0640\u062d\u064e\u0640\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0640\u062f\u0652 \u0626\u0650\u0640\u06a0 \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0640\u0648\u0644\u0652 \u0633\u0650\u0640\u06a0 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n* '''English translation''' \u2013 [[Shahada|There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah]]\n\nThe Arabic script used to write the Tausug language differs in some aspects to the script used for the Arabic language and in the Jawi script used for Malay languages. One of the main differences is in the way that word-initial vowels are written.\n\nIn Arabic, /in/ is (\u0625\u0646); in Jawi (Malay), it is (\u0627\u0646). In Tausug, it is (\u0626\u0650\u0646). The Tausug Arabic script utilises the letter y\u0101' with a hamza (\u0626) to represent a short vowel. If a kasra (\u0626\u0650) is added, it becomes an 'i' sound. If a fatha (\u0626\u064e) is added, it becomes an 'a' sound. If a damma (\u0626\u064f) is added, it becomes a 'u' sound.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Tausug Alphabet \u2013 Arabic Script\n|- style=\"font-size:small\"\n!
