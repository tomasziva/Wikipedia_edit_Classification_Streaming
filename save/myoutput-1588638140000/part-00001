The county is governed by a seven-member board of County Commissioners, elected at large to serve four-year terms. Terms are staggered so that, every two years, three or four Commissioners are up for election. The Commissioners enact policies such as establishment of the property tax rate, regulation of land use and zoning outside municipal jurisdictions, and adoption of the annual budget. Commissioners usually meet on the first and third Mondays of each month.\n\n==Trivia==\n* The area has historically been one of the leading [[brick]] manufacturing areas in the [[United States]].\n* [[Cotton]] and [[tobacco]] are leading crops in the county.\n* The county is divided between the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in the northern part of the county and the [[Sandhills (Carolina)|Sandhills]] in the south.\n* Lee County sits in the middle of the [[Triassic Basin]] and has the state's most concentrated reserves of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas in the United States|natural gas]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[List of counties in North Carolina]]\n* [[List of memorials to Robert E.

The county is governed by a seven-member board of County Commissioners, elected at large to serve four-year terms. Terms are staggered so that, every two years, three or four Commissioners are up for election. The Commissioners enact policies such as establishment of the property tax rate, regulation of land use and zoning outside municipal jurisdictions, and adoption of the annual budget. Commissioners usually meet on the first and third Mondays of each month.\n\n==Trivia==\n* The area has historically been one of the leading [[brick]] manufacturing areas in the [[United States]].\n* [[Cotton]] and [[tobacco]] are leading crops in the county.\n* The county is divided between the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in the northern part of the county and the [[Sandhills (Carolina)|Sandhills]] in the south.\n* Lee County sits in the middle of the [[Triassic Basin]] and has the state's most concentrated reserves of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas in the United States|natural gas]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[List of counties in North Carolina]]\n* [[List of memorials to Robert E.
