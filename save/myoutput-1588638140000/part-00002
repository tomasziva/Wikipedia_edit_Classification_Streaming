The majority of the Kaiadilt fled into the sea where those that were not shot from the shore drowned. Those that tried to escape along the beach were hunted down and shot, with the exception of a small number who reached nearby mangroves where the settlers' horses could not follow. Several young women were raped on the beach, then held prisoner in McKenzie's hut for three days before being released.

Massacre of [[Walmajarri]] people by the [[Mandjildjara]] in the [[Great Sandy Desert]], WA. One of the last, systematic massacres of Aboriginal Australians recorded in Australia.  The four aboriginal Mandjildjara brothers entered Walmajarri country and systematically pursued and killed many Walmajarri men, women, and young children and kidnapped other young women as wives near Japingka in Walmajarri country. In March 1961, two of the perpetrators were apprehended and sentenced to 50 days prison for killing a bullock, but released from prison within a few days after intense lobbying of the Government by various industrial unions in WA. They were never charged with murder or child abduction.<ref>[Eye-witness accounts by Ngarta and Jukuna \u2013 \"Two Sisters\" \u2013 Magala books 2016, ISBN 978- 1-925360-27-1]</ref>\n\n=== Queensland ===\n\n==== 1910s ====\n* '''1918''' Bentinck Island: Part of the [[Wellesley Islands]] group, which includes [[Mornington Island]], Bentinck Island was home to the Kaiadilt clan of just over 100 people. In 1911, a man by the name of McKenzie (other names unknown) was given a government lease for nearby [[Sweers Island]] that also covered the eastern portion of the much larger Bentinck Island. Arriving on Bentinck with an Aboriginal woman plus a flock of sheep, he built a hut near the Kurumbali estuary. Although the Kaiadilt avoided contact and refrained from approaching McKenzie's property he is alleged to have often explored the island, shooting any males he found while raping the women. In 1918, McKenzie organised a hunt with an unknown number of settlers from the mainland and, beginning from the northern tip of the island, herded the Indigenous inhabitants to the beach on its southern shore. The majority of the Kaiadilt fled into the sea where those that were not shot from the shore drowned. Those that tried to escape along the beach were hunted down and shot, with the exception of a small number who reached nearby mangroves where the settlers' horses could not follow. Several young women were raped on the beach, then held prisoner in McKenzie's hut for three days before being released. As the Kaiadilt remained isolated throughout much of the 20th century, the massacre remained unknown to the authorities until researchers recorded accounts given by survivors in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Elder2\">{{cite book | last = [[Bruce Elder (journalist)|Bruce Elder]] | year = 1998 | title = Blood on the Wattle: Massacres and maltreatment of Aboriginal Australians since 1788 | publisher = New Holland Publishers | location = Page 203\u2013206 | isbn = 978-1-86436-410-1 }}</ref>\n\n=== Northern Territory ===\n\n==== 1920s ====\n* '''1928''' [[Coniston massacre]]: In August 1928, a [[Northern Territory Police]] constable, [[William George Murray]], was ordered to investigate the killing of a white man named Fred Brooks by several Aboriginal people at a waterhole to the west of [[Coniston (Northern Territory)|Coniston]] cattle station. Murray led a series of [[punitive expedition]]s from August until October 1928 which officially resulted in the deaths of 31 mostly [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] and [[Kaytetye people]]. Other men who participated with Murray in the mass killings included local landholders William \"Nugget\" Morton and Randall Stafford; cattlemen John Saxby, William Briscoe and Alex Wilson; and three Aboriginal trackers who went by the names of Paddy, Dodger and Major. Analysis of the existing documentation and surviving Aboriginal testimonies indicate that somewhere between 100 and 200 people were shot dead during this police operation, a number far higher than the official bodycount.<ref name=\"Bradley\">{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Michael |title=Coniston |date=2019 |publisher=UWA Press |location=Perth}}</ref> Murray later escorted two Aboriginal prisoners to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] to face trial for the killing of Fred Brooks. At this trial Murray freely gave evidence to the presiding judge that he shot a large number of Aboriginals during the operation, that he shot to kill and shot dead wounded men and women. The judge noted that Murray \"mowed them down wholesale.\" Murray's admissions in court led to widespread publicity about the massacres and a governmental Board of Enquiry was set up to investigate the incident.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cribbin |first1=John |title=The Killing Times |date=1984 |publisher=Fontana |location=Sydney}}</ref> The Board of Enquiry was a [[whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]] set up to protect the colonial system in the Northern Territory and it found that the shootings were justified.
