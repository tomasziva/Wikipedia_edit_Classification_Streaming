It is part of the [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande region]] between [[Zihuatanejo]] and [[Acapulco]].  The city is known for the Sanctuary of the Padre Jes\u00fas de Petatl\u00e1n, a 17th-century image of Christ that is claimed to have performed religious miracles. The city is the seat of a large municipality, which faces the Pacific Ocean to the south and is bounded by the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] to the north. It contains the [[La Soledad de Maciel (archeological site)|La Soledad de Maciel archeological site]]. The area's recent history has been marked by violence related to the drug trade and to struggles between business and local farmers and environmental groups.  [[St. Peter, Minnesota]] is a sister city of Petatl\u00e1n.\n\n==The city==\nThe city is located just off Federal Highway 200 east of the tourist attraction of Zihuatanejo.

First [[Aztec]] presence in the Costa Grande region came in 1497. In 1504, [[Moctezuma Xocoyotzin]] established the tribute province of Cihuatl\u00e1n, with included the Petatl\u00e1n area.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Petatl\u00e1n was part of an [[encomienda]] belonging to Gin\u00e9s de Pinz\u00f3n. Evangelization was carried out under [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] Juan Bautista Moya. This same friar gathered the dispersed peoples to found the modern town in 1550. This town became a dependency of the subdelegation of Zacatuna in 1786.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Petatl\u00e1n was made part of the Tecpan province, which was created by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n]] in 1811. During the reign of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], it became part of the Capitan\u00eda General del Sur. When Mexico became a republic, it became part of the district of Acapulco, in the [[State of Mexico]]. When Guerrero was made an independent state, Petatl\u00e1n became part of the district of Galeana.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nIt became an independent municipality for the first time in 1870, combining territory from the municipality of [[La Uni\u00f3n de Isidoro Montes de Oca|De la Union]] and some communities from Tecpan. It was for a short time in 1871 and then reconstituted. In 1913, the town was besieged by the Zapatistas. In 1953, some of its western territory was lost in the formation of the [[Zihuatanejo de Azueta|Jos\u00e9 Azueta (Zihuatanejo) municipality]].<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nThe city's and municipality's recent history has centered on violence related to drugs and the environment. Drug-related violence of the past several decades has taken its toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years.<ref name=\"perdidas\"/> The violence is not limited to the city of Petatl\u00e1n; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades. A number of these have been partly or fully abandoned as drug-related violence grows.

It is part of the [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande region]] between [[Zihuatanejo]] and [[Acapulco]].  The city is known for the Sanctuary of the Padre Jes\u00fas de Petatl\u00e1n, a 17th-century image of Christ that is claimed to have performed religious miracles. The city is the seat of a large municipality, which faces the Pacific Ocean to the south and is bounded by the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] to the north. It contains the [[La Soledad de Maciel (archeological site)|La Soledad de Maciel archeological site]]. The area's recent history has been marked by violence related to the drug trade and to struggles between business and local farmers and environmental groups.  [[St. Peter, Minnesota]] is a sister city of Petatl\u00e1n.\n\n==The city==\nThe city is located just off Federal Highway 200 east of the tourist attraction of Zihuatanejo.

First [[Aztec]] presence in the Costa Grande region came in 1497. In 1504, [[Moctezuma Xocoyotzin]] established the tribute province of Cihuatl\u00e1n, with included the Petatl\u00e1n area.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Petatl\u00e1n was part of an [[encomienda]] belonging to Gin\u00e9s de Pinz\u00f3n. Evangelization was carried out under [[Augustinian]] Juan Bautista Moya. This same friar gathered the dispersed peoples to found the modern town in 1550. This town became a dependency of the subdelegation of Zacatuna in 1786.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Petatl\u00e1n was made part of the Tecpan province, which was created by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n]] in 1811. During the reign of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], it became part of the Capitan\u00eda General del Sur. When Mexico became a republic, it became part of the district of Acapulco, in the [[State of Mexico]]. When Guerrero was made an independent state, Petatl\u00e1n became part of the district of Galeana.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nIt became an independent municipality for the first time in 1870, combining territory from the municipality of [[La Uni\u00f3n de Isidoro Montes de Oca|De la Union]] and some communities from Tecpan. It was for a short time in 1871 and then reconstituted. In 1913, the town was besieged by the Zapatistas. In 1953, some of its western territory was lost in the formation of the [[Zihuatanejo de Azueta|Jos\u00e9 Azueta (Zihuatanejo) municipality]].<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nThe city's and municipality's recent history has centered on violence related to drugs and the environment. Drug-related violence of the past several decades has taken its toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years.<ref name=\"perdidas\"/> The violence is not limited to the city of Petatl\u00e1n; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades.
