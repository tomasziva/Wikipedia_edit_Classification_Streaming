{"title_page": "List of foreign recipients of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by country", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\nThe following is a list of notable foreign recipients of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by their country of origin. The Order of [[Legion d'Honneur|L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] is the highest decoration in France and is divided into five degrees: ''Chevalier'' (Knight), ''Officier'' (Officer), ''Commandeur'' (Commander), ''Grand Officier'' (Grand Officer) and ''Grand Croix'' (Grand Cross).\n\nMembership in the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur is restricted to French nationals.<ref>L\u00e9gion Code, article 16.</ref> Foreign nationals who have served France or the ideals it upholds<ref>''Les \u00e9trangers qui se seront signal\u00e9s par les services qu\u2019ils ont rendus \u00e0 la France ou aux causes qu\u2019elle soutient'', L\u00e9gion Code, art. 128.</ref> may, however, receive a distinction of the L\u00e9gion, which is nearly the same thing as membership in the L\u00e9gion. Foreign nationals who live in France are submitted to the same requirements as Frenchmen. Foreign nationals who live abroad may be awarded a distinction of any rank or dignity in the L\u00e9gion.\n\nA complete, chronological list of the members of the Legion of Honour nominated from the very first ceremony in 1803 to now does not exist. The number is estimated at one million. Among them about 3000 were decorated with the Grand Cross (including 1200 French).<ref>WATTEL Michel et B\u00e9atrice, ''Les Grand'Croix de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur.
