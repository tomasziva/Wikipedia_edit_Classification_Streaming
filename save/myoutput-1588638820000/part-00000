He achieved this not only while war had broken out between France and England, but also at a time when the [[Society of Jesus]] was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed]] in most of Europe and its colonies.<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web|title=British Jesuits - From the Archives: On The Anniversary of Fr Marmaduke Stone SJ|author=Mary Allen|publisher=www.jesuit.org.uk |url=https://www.jesuit.org.uk/blog/archives-anniversary-fr-marmaduke-stone-sj|date=2018|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>  \n\n==Life==\nMarmaduke Stone was born in [[Draycott in the Moors|Draycott]] near Painsley, [[Staffordshire]] into a [[recusant]] family and educated at [[Colleges of St Omer, Bruges and Li\u00e8ge|St. Omer]] in [[Northern France]]. At that time, Catholic education was not permitted in Britain. His education was interrupted when the entire school was forced to decamp to [[Bruges]] [[Austrian Netherlands]] on 10\u201317 August 1762, due to sudden French restrictions put on the order.\n\nStone entered the Society of Jesus in 1767 in [[Ghent]], and studied at the Li\u00e8ge Academy.<ref name=\"Allen\"/> In 1790 he succeeded Father William Strickland SJ as president, who then became procurator in London. With his assistance Father Stone succeeded in guiding the English \"ex-Jesuits\" through more than a score of tempestuous years. Father Stone's brethren, though held together by a common vocation and their still uncancelled vows, were not allowed by the brief of suppression to reunite for purposes of government. He could therefore only rule by appealing to conscience. When dealing with the bishops, he could claim no rights, not even those essential to religious bodies. Fortunately, they were not hostile, though their views on Jesuit property and privileges caused Stone much trouble.\n\nOn 14 July 1794, the College at Li\u00e8ge was transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]]. In spite of the magnitude of the task, it was accomplished in good order and the schools reopened the following 22 October. A [[Rescript]] from the Roman [[Sacra congregatio de propaganda fide|Propaganda]] (14 February 1796) confirmed Stonyhurst in all the privileges of Li\u00e8ge. A restoration of the Society during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars was unlikely and it was practicable to work for a reunion with the Russian Jesuits, whose corporate existence had been recognized in Rome. In this Father Stone was successful. On 19 May 1803, having made his profession, he was declared provincial, and admitted others to their vows, for England, Ireland, and Maryland. On 29 September a novitiate was opened at [[Hodder Place]]. Rome, however, gave no public recognition of the restored order, though the pope privately expressed his pleasure. When the Bull of Restoration finally came (7 August 1814), the interpretation was added (2 December 1816), that it was to apply only where the secular government wished; in England, therefore, the Jesuits were to be regarded as still in their old position. The college had grown enormously since its transfer to England and the Jesuit missions had prospered steadily. Father Stone, notwithstanding his years, continued to act as college minister till 1827, when he finally retired to [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]. Here the good news reached him (1829) that the English Jesuits had at last been formally recognized. He died in St Helens in 1834 and was buried in nearby Windlesham Abbey.<ref>{{cite book|title=Windleshaw Chantry and Cemetery|author=Rev Austin Powell|url=https://ia802604.us.archive.org/23/items/transactions02chesgoog/transactions02chesgoog.pdf| pages= 27-28|publisher= Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire for the year 1887|date=1887}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|}}\n\n==References==\n\n*Correspondence at Stonyhurst and elsewhere;\n*Gerard, ''Stonyhurst College'' (1894);\n*Foley, ''Records S.
