[[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was \"Byblos ship\".  Archaeologists have recovered [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second dynasty]] ruler [[Khasekhemwy]], although this \"may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period\".<ref>Wilkinson, Toby, 1999, ''Early Dynastic Egypt'' p.78.</ref> Objects have been found at Byblos naming the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king [[Neferhotep I]], and the rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.\n\nAround 1350 BC, the [[Amarna letters]] include 60 letters from [[Rib-Hadda]] and his successor [[Ili-Rapih]] who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda's constant pleas for military assistance from [[Akhenaten]]. They also deal with the conquest of neighboring city-states by the [[Habiru]].\n\nIt appears Egyptian contact peaked during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], only to decline during the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|20th]] and [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|21st]] dynasties. In addition, when the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia.<ref>\"Byblos\" in: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, vol. 2, p. 692.

Oxford University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280458-7}}</ref>\n\nArchaeological evidence at Byblos, particularly the five [[Byblian royal inscriptions]] dating back to around 1200\u20131000 BC, shows existence of a [[Phoenician alphabet]] of twenty-two characters; an important example is the [[Ahiram sarcophagus]]. The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the [[Temple of the Obelisks]], dedicated to the [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite war god]] [[Resheph]], but this had fallen into ruins by the time of [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n[[File:Traditional lebanese house at Byblos.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Lebanese house overlooking the Mediterranean sea, Byblos. This house is within the antiquities complex and illustrates the modern ground level with respect to excavations]]\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nIn the [[Assyria]]n period, [[Sibittibaal]] of Byblos became tributary to [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when [[Sennacherib]] conquered all [[Phoenicia]], the king of Byblos was [[Urumilki]].  Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings [[Esarhaddon]] (r. 681\u2013669 BC) and [[Ashurbanipal]] (r. 668\u2013627 BC), under its own kings [[Milkiasaph]] and [[Yehawmelek]].\n\nIn the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (538\u2013332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], and [[Arwad]].\n\n[[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] rule came with the arrival of [[Alexander the Great]] in the area in 332 BC. [[Currency|Coinage]] was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries.\n\n[[File:Roman era Phonesia.png|thumb|left|[[map]] of [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] Phoenicia.]]\n[[File:Byblos-109933.jpg|thumb|Ruins at port.]]\nDuring the [[Ancient Rome|Greco-Roman]] period, the temple of [[Resheph]] was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyre and Sidon, was a center for the cult of [[Adonis]]. In the 3rd century, a small but impressive [[theater]] was constructed.  With the rise of [[Christianity]], a [[Episcopal see|bishopric]] was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly.  Although a [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] colony is known to have been established in the region following the [[early Muslim conquests]] of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with [[Europe]] effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the [[First Crusade]] in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Giblet or Jebail.\n\n=== Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period ===\n[[File:Byblos Castle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crusader Fort]]\n[[File:St JohnByblos.jpg|thumb|right|The Crusades-era Church of St. John-Mark in Byblos]]\nIn the 12th and 13th century Byblos became part of the [[County of Tripoli]], a [[Crusader states|Crusader state]] connected to, but [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Northern States|largely independent]] from, the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. As Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[Embriaco family]], who created for themselves  the [[Lord of Gibelet|Lordship of Gibelet]]. Their residence, the [[Byblos Castle|Crusader castle of Gibelet]], along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by [[Saladin]] in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, conquered by [[Baibars]] in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300. Having voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mission de Ph\u00e9nicie|last=Renan|first=Ernest|publisher=Imprimerie imp\u00e9riale|year=1864|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=157}}</ref> Its fortifications were subsequently restored.{{dubious|The castle, or the city walls?

[[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was \"Byblos ship\".  Archaeologists have recovered [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second dynasty]] ruler [[Khasekhemwy]], although this \"may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period\".<ref>Wilkinson, Toby, 1999, ''Early Dynastic Egypt'' p.78.</ref> Objects have been found at Byblos naming the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king [[Neferhotep I]], and the rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.\n\nAround 1350 BC, the [[Amarna letters]] include 60 letters from [[Rib-Hadda]] and his successor [[Ili-Rapih]] who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda's constant pleas for military assistance from [[Akhenaten]]. They also deal with the conquest of neighboring city-states by the [[Habiru]].\n\nIt appears Egyptian contact peaked during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], only to decline during the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|20th]] and [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|21st]] dynasties. In addition, when the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia.<ref>\"Byblos\" in: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, vol. 2, p. 692.

The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the [[Temple of the Obelisks]], dedicated to the [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite war god]] [[Resheph]], but this had fallen into ruins by the time of [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n[[File:Traditional lebanese house at Byblos.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Lebanese house overlooking the Mediterranean sea, Byblos. This house is within the antiquities complex and illustrates the modern ground level with respect to excavations]]\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nIn the [[Assyria]]n period, [[Sibittibaal]] of Byblos became tributary to [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when [[Sennacherib]] conquered all [[Phoenicia]], the king of Byblos was [[Urumilki]].  Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings [[Esarhaddon]] (r. 681\u2013669 BC) and [[Ashurbanipal]] (r. 668\u2013627 BC), under its own kings [[Milkiasaph]] and [[Yehawmelek]].\n\nIn the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (538\u2013332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], and [[Arwad]].\n\n[[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] rule came with the arrival of [[Alexander the Great]] in the area in 332 BC. [[Currency|Coinage]] was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries.\n\n[[File:Roman era Phonesia.png|thumb|left|[[map]] of [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] Phoenicia.]]\n[[File:Byblos-109933.jpg|thumb|Ruins at port.]]\nDuring the [[Ancient Rome|Greco-Roman]] period, the temple of [[Resheph]] was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyre and Sidon, was a center for the cult of [[Adonis]]. In the 3rd century, a small but impressive [[theater]] was constructed.  With the rise of [[Christianity]], a [[Episcopal see|bishopric]] was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly.  Although a [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] colony is known to have been established in the region following the [[early Muslim conquests]] of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with [[Europe]] effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the [[First Crusade]] in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Giblet or Jebail.\n\n=== Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period ===\n[[File:Byblos Castle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crusader Fort]]\n[[File:St JohnByblos.jpg|thumb|right|The Crusades-era Church of St. John-Mark in Byblos]]\nIn the 12th and 13th century Byblos became part of the [[County of Tripoli]], a [[Crusader states|Crusader state]] connected to, but [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Northern States|largely independent]] from, the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. As Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[Embriaco family]], who created for themselves  the [[Lord of Gibelet|Lordship of Gibelet]]. Their residence, the [[Byblos Castle|Crusader castle of Gibelet]], along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by [[Saladin]] in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, conquered by [[Baibars]] in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300. Having voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mission de Ph\u00e9nicie|last=Renan|first=Ernest|publisher=Imprimerie imp\u00e9riale|year=1864|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=157}}</ref> Its fortifications were subsequently restored.{{dubious|The castle, or the city walls?
