The tribe controlled most of [[Northern England]] and more territory than any other Celtic tribe in England. That they had the Yorkshire area as their heartland is evident in that ''[[Isurium Brigantum]]'' (now known as [[Aldborough, North Yorkshire|Aldborough]]) was the capital town of their ''[[civitas]]'' under Roman rule.

Four universities are based in Leeds, two in Sheffield, two in York, and one each in Bradford, Hull, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield (the last with branches in Barnsley and Oldham). The largest universities by enrolment are [[Sheffield Hallam University]] and the [[University of Leeds]], each with over 31,000 students, followed by [[Leeds Beckett University]], and the most recent to attain university status is the [[Leeds Arts University]]. There are also branches of institutions headquartered in other parts of England, such as the [[Open University]] and Britain's first for-profit university (since 2012), the [[University of Law]].

The [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region of [[Government Office]] covers most, but not all of the [[Historic counties of England|historic]] county.\n\n===Distinctive identity and devolution campaigns===\n\nA number of claims have been made for the distinctiveness of Yorkshire, as a geographical, cultural and political entity, and these have been used to demand increased political autonomy. In the early twentieth century, [[F. W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[Leeds University]], claimed Yorkshire was not settled by [[Angles]] or [[Saxons]] following the end of Roman rule in Britain, but by a different Germanic tribe, the [[Geats]]. As a consequence, he claimed, it is possible the first work of English literature, ''[[Beowulf]]'', believed to have been composed by Geats, was written in Yorkshire, and this distinctive ethnic and cultural origin is the root of the unique status of Yorkshire today.<ref name=\"moorman\" /> One of Moorman's students at Leeds University, [[Herbert Read]], was greatly influenced by Moorman's ideas on Yorkshire identity, and claimed that until recent times Yorkshire was effectively an island, cut off from the rest of England by rivers, fens, moors and mountains. This distancing of Yorkshire from England led Read to question whether Yorkshire people were really English at all.<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite news |first=Herbert |last=Read |title=Review of Frederic Richard Pearson, ''Yorkshire'' |newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement |date=31 January 1929 |page=79}}</ref> Combined with the suggested ethnic difference to the rest of England, Read quoted Frederic Pearson, who wrote:\n\n{{quote|There is something characteristic about the very physiognomy of the Yorkshireman. He is much more of a Dane or a Viking than a Saxon. He is usually a big upstanding man, who looks as if he could take care of himself and those who depend upon him in an emergency. This is indeed the character that his neighbours give him; the southerner may think him a little hard: but if ever our country is let down by its inhabitants, we may be sure that it will not be the fault of Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Pearson\"/>}}\n\nDuring the premiership of [[William Pitt the Younger]] the hypothetical idea of Yorkshire becoming independent was raised in the British parliament in relation to the question whether Ireland should become part of the [[Acts of Union 1800|United Kingdom]]. This resulted in an anonymous pamphlet being published in London in 1799 arguing at length that Yorkshire could never be an independent state as it would always be reliant on the rest of the United Kingdom to provide it with essential resources.<ref>Anonymous pamphlet, Thoughts on national independence, suggested by Mr. Pitt's speeches on the Irish union by a member of the honourable society of Lincoln's Inn, (London: Printed Privately, 1799), pp.25\u201327</ref>\n\nAlthough in the devolution debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the late 1960s, which paved the way for the 1979 referenda on the creation of a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, parallel devolution for Yorkshire was suggested, this was opposed by the [[Scottish National Party]] Member of Parliament for Hamilton, [[Winifred Ewing]].

Most of the county falls within [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. The extreme northern part of the county, such as [[Middlesbrough]], [[Redcar]], [[Holwick]] and [[Startforth]], fall within [[North East England]]. Small areas in the west of the historic county, like [[Saddleworth]], [[Barnoldswick]] and [[Sedbergh]], fall within [[North West England]]. During these processes the geographical or historic boundaries of Yorkshire remained unchanged.\n\nWithin the regions are both ceremonial counties, and the actual units of local government, such as unitary authorities, as detailed at [[Yorkshire and the Humber#Local government|Local government divisions of Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[North East England#Local government|Local government divisions of North East England]] and [[North West England#Local government|Local government divisions of North West England]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2009}}\n[[File:Bridgewater Place from Call Lane.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Bridgewater Place]], a symbol of Leeds' growing financial importance.]]\nYorkshire has a mixed economy, and accounts for about 8% of UK GDP.

[[Harrogate]] and [[Knaresborough]] both have small legal and financial sectors. Harrogate is a European conference and exhibition destination with both the Great Yorkshire Showground and [[Harrogate International Centre]] in the town.\n\nCoal mining was extremely active in the south of the county during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, particularly around [[Barnsley]] and [[Wakefield]].

Four universities are based in Leeds, two in Sheffield, two in York, and one each in Bradford, Hull, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield (the last with branches in Barnsley and Oldham). The largest universities by enrolment are [[Sheffield Hallam University]] and the [[University of Leeds]], each with over 31,000 students, followed by [[Leeds Beckett University]], and the most recent to attain university status is the [[Leeds Arts University]]. There are also branches of institutions headquartered in other parts of England, such as the [[Open University]] and Britain's first for-profit university (since 2012), the [[University of Law]].

The [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region of [[Government Office]] covers most, but not all of the [[Historic counties of England|historic]] county.\n\n===Distinctive identity and devolution campaigns===\n\nA number of claims have been made for the distinctiveness of Yorkshire, as a geographical, cultural and political entity, and these have been used to demand increased political autonomy. In the early twentieth century, [[F. W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[Leeds University]], claimed Yorkshire was not settled by [[Angles]] or [[Saxons]] following the end of Roman rule in Britain, but by a different Germanic tribe, the [[Geats]]. As a consequence, he claimed, it is possible the first work of English literature, ''[[Beowulf]]'', believed to have been composed by Geats, was written in Yorkshire, and this distinctive ethnic and cultural origin is the root of the unique status of Yorkshire today.<ref name=\"moorman\" /> One of Moorman's students at Leeds University, [[Herbert Read]], was greatly influenced by Moorman's ideas on Yorkshire identity, and claimed that until recent times Yorkshire was effectively an island, cut off from the rest of England by rivers, fens, moors and mountains. This distancing of Yorkshire from England led Read to question whether Yorkshire people were really English at all.<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite news |first=Herbert |last=Read |title=Review of Frederic Richard Pearson, ''Yorkshire'' |newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement |date=31 January 1929 |page=79}}</ref> Combined with the suggested ethnic difference to the rest of England, Read quoted Frederic Pearson, who wrote:\n\n{{quote|There is something characteristic about the very physiognomy of the Yorkshireman. He is much more of a Dane or a Viking than a Saxon. He is usually a big upstanding man, who looks as if he could take care of himself and those who depend upon him in an emergency. This is indeed the character that his neighbours give him; the southerner may think him a little hard: but if ever our country is let down by its inhabitants, we may be sure that it will not be the fault of Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Pearson\"/>}}\n\nDuring the premiership of [[William Pitt the Younger]] the hypothetical idea of Yorkshire becoming independent was raised in the British parliament in relation to the question whether Ireland should become part of the [[Acts of Union 1800|United Kingdom]]. This resulted in an anonymous pamphlet being published in London in 1799 arguing at length that Yorkshire could never be an independent state as it would always be reliant on the rest of the United Kingdom to provide it with essential resources.<ref>Anonymous pamphlet, Thoughts on national independence, suggested by Mr. Pitt's speeches on the Irish union by a member of the honourable society of Lincoln's Inn, (London: Printed Privately, 1799), pp.25\u201327</ref>\n\nAlthough in the devolution debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the late 1960s, which paved the way for the 1979 referenda on the creation of a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, parallel devolution for Yorkshire was suggested, this was opposed by the [[Scottish National Party]] Member of Parliament for Hamilton, [[Winifred Ewing]]. Ewing argued that it was offensive to Scots to argue that an English region had the same status as an 'ancient nation' such as Scotland.<ref>Hansard Parliamentary Papers, HC Deb, 14 February 1969, vol. 777, cc1725-76</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Yorkshire and Scottish devolution was again made in 1975 by Richard Wainwright, MP for Colne Valley, who claimed in a speech in the House of Commons:\n\n{{quote|The nationalist movement in Scotland is associated with flags, strange costumes, weird music and extravagant ceremonial. When... people go to Yorkshire and find that we have no time for dressing up, waving flags and playing strange instruments\u2014in other words, we are not a lot of Presbyterians in Yorkshire\u2014they should not assume that we do not have the same feelings underneath the skin. Independence in Yorkshire expresses itself in a markedly increasing determination to establish self-reliance.<ref>Hansard Parliamentary Papers, HC Deb, 18 December 1975, vol. 902, cc1832-52</ref>}}\n\nIn more recent years, in 1998 the Campaign for Yorkshire was established to push for the creation of a Yorkshire regional assembly,<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Hazell |title=The State and the Nations: The First Year of Devolution in the United Kingdom |location=London |publisher=Imprint Academic |date=2000 |page=118}}</ref> sometimes dubbed the Yorkshire Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where there's muck |newspaper=The Independent |date=18 March 1999 |page=3}}</ref> In its defining statement, the Campaign for Yorkshire made reference to the historical notions that Yorkshire had a distinctive identity:\n\n{{quote|Yorkshire and the Humber has distinctive characteristics which make it an ideal test bed for further reform. It has a strong popular identity. The region follows closely the historic boundaries of the three Ridings, and there is no serious debate about boundaries. It possesses strong existing regional partnerships including universities, voluntary and church associations. All this makes it realistic to regard Yorkshire and the Humber as the standard bearer for representative regional government.<ref>Campaign for Yorkshire literature, quoted in Robert Hazell, ''The State and the Nations: The First Year of Devolution in the United Kingdom'' (London: Imprint Academic, 2000) p.140</ref>}}\n\nThe Campaign for Yorkshire was led by Jane Thomas as Director<ref>{{cite news |title=New Director for Campaign Group |newspaper=Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph |date=13 October 1999 |page=5}}</ref> and Paul Jagger as chairman.

In September 2013, the Executive Committee was joined by Richard Honnoraty and Richard Carter (as an advisor), who had also been involved in the Campaign for Yorkshire.
