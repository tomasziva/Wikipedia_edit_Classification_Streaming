Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and [[Arthur Andersen]]. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit \u2013 whether AA or AC \u2013 pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into [[escrow]] and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2&nbsp;billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.<ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Mitchell |date=8 August 2000 |title=Arbitrator's Ruling Goes Against Accounting Arm : Consultants Win Battle Of Andersen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-consult.2.t.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Emergence of Accenture ===\nOn 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, \"Accenture\". The word \"Accenture\" is derived from \"Accent on the future\". The name \"Accenture\" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Andersen felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.<ref>[https://www.informationweek.com/andersen-consulting-changing-name-to-accenture-/d/d-id/1009400 Andersen Consulting Changing Name To Accenture \u2013 26 Oct. 2000]; InformationWeek</ref>\n\n[[File:AccentureNYSE.jpg|thumb|right|Accenture's banner hanging on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] ([[NYSE]]) building for its initial public offering on 19 July 2001.]]\nOn 19 July 2001, Accenture's initial public offering ([[initial public offering|IPO]]) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE); [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] served as its lead underwriters.

Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and [[Arthur Andersen]]. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit \u2013 whether AA or AC \u2013 pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into [[escrow]] and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2&nbsp;billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.<ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Mitchell |date=8 August 2000 |title=Arbitrator's Ruling Goes Against Accounting Arm : Consultants Win Battle Of Andersen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-consult.2.t.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Emergence of Accenture ===\nOn 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, \"Accenture\". The word \"Accenture\" is derived from \"Accent on the future\". The name \"Accenture\" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Andersen felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.<ref>[https://www.informationweek.com/andersen-consulting-changing-name-to-accenture-/d/d-id/1009400 Andersen Consulting Changing Name To Accenture \u2013 26 Oct. 2000]; InformationWeek</ref>\n\n[[File:AccentureNYSE.jpg|thumb|right|Accenture's banner hanging on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] ([[NYSE]]) building for its initial public offering on 19 July 2001.]]\nOn 19 July 2001, Accenture's initial public offering ([[initial public offering|IPO]]) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE); [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] served as its lead underwriters.
