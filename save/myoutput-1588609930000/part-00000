The ''[[\u017eupe]]'' (counties) of Sitnica and Lipljan, which had territory around present-day Pristina, are mentioned in ''Life of Saint Simeon'', a text written by the Serbian historical figure [[Saint Sava]] between 1201 and 1208.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The city was also a royal estate of [[Stefan Milutin]], [[Stefan Uro\u0161 III]], [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], [[Stefan Uro\u0161 V]] and [[Vuk Brankovi\u0107]].<ref name=\"Izdanja\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIFpAAAAMAAJ|page=22|title=Kosovo i metohija tokom vekova: Zublja|last1=Leki\u0107|first1=\u0110or\u0111e|year=1995}}</ref> The medieval fort of Vi\u0161egrad, whose ruins lie three kilometres east of the city centre, was mentioned in Milutin's time,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgMIAAAAMAAJ|page=167|title=Yugoslavia: Cultural Monuments of Serbia|last1=Pani\u0107-Surep|first1=Milorad|year=1965}}</ref> and served as his capital,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx4qAQAAMAAJ|page=392|title=Serbia: The country, people, life, customs|isbn=9788678910319|last1=Vlahovi\u0107|first1=Petar|year=2004}}</ref> and the nearby [[Gra\u010danica monastery]] was founded by him in ca. 1315.\n\nThe first historical record mentioning Pristina by its name dates back to 1342 when the Byzantine Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] described Pristina as a 'village'.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />{{better source|date=December 2013}}\n\nBetween the end of the 14th and the middle of the 15th century, Ottoman rule was gradually imposed in the town.\n\n===Ottoman Era===\n{{See also|Ottoman Kosovo}} \nIn the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, Pristina developed as an important mining and trading center thanks to its proximity to the rich mining town of [[Novo Brdo]], and due to its position of the Balkan trade routes. The old town stretching out between the Vellusha and Prishtevka rivers which are both covered over today, became an important crafts and trade center. Pristina was famous for its annual trade fairs (''Panair'')<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> and its goat hide and goat hair articles. Around 50 different crafts were practiced from tanning to leather dying, belt making and silk weaving, as well as crafts related to the military \u2013 armorers, smiths, and saddle makers. As early as 1485, Pristina artisans also started producing gunpowder. Trade was thriving and there was a growing colony of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] traders (from modern day [[Dubrovnik]]) providing the link between Pristina's craftsmen and the outside world.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The first mosque was constructed in the late 14th century while still under Serbian rule.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The 1487 defter recorded 412 Christian and 94 Muslim households in Pristina, which at the time was administratively part of the [[Sanjak of Vu\u010ditrn]].\nIn the early Ottoman era, [[Islam]] was an urban phenomenon and only spread slowly with increasing urbanization. The travel writer [[Evliya Celebi]], visiting Pristina in the 1660s was impressed with its fine gardens and vineyards.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />  In those years, Pristina was part of the V\u0131\u00e7\u0131t\u0131r\u0131n Sanjak and its 2,000 families enjoyed the peace and stability of the Ottoman era. Economic life was controlled by the guild system (''esnafs'') with the tanners' and bakers' guild controlling prices, limiting unfair competition and acting as banks for their members. Religious life was dominated by religious charitable organizations often building mosques or fountains and providing charity to the poor.\nDuring the [[Austro-Turkish War (1683\u20131699)|Austro-Turkish War]] in the late 17th century, Pristina citizens under the leadership of the Catholic Albanian priest [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] pledged loyalty to the Austrian army and supplied troops. He contributed a force of 6,000 Albanian soldiers to the Austrian army which had arrived in Pristina. Under Austrian occupation, the Fatih Mosque (''Mbretit Mosque'') was briefly converted to a [[Jesuit]] church.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> Following the Austrian defeat in January 1690, Pristina's inhabitants were left at the mercy of Ottoman and [[Tatar]] troops who took revenge against the local population as punishment for their co-operation with the Austrians. A French officer traveling to Pristina noted soon afterwards that \"Pristina looked impressive from a distance but close up it is a mass of muddy streets and houses made of earth\".<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Modern===\n\n[[File:Monument of Brotherhood and Unity in Pristina.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Monument of '''[[Brotherhood and Unity]]''' by [[Miodrag \u017divkovi\u0107 (sculptor)|Miodrag \u017divkovi\u0107]] in the centre.

That year the railway between [[Salonika]] and [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] started operations and the seat of the vilayet of Prizren was relocated to Pristina. This privileged position as capital of the Ottoman vilayet lasted only for a short while. from January until August 1912, Pristina was liberated from Ottoman rule by Albanian rebel forces led by [[Hasan Prishtina]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Bogdanovi\u0107\n| first      = Dimitrije\n| authorlink = Dimitrije Bogdanovi\u0107\n| editor        = Antonije Isakovi\u0107\n| title         = Knjiga o Kosovu\n| url           = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/index.html\n| accessdate    = January 9, 2011\n| volume    = 2\n| origyear  = 1984\n|date=November 2000\n| publisher = [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n| location  = Belgrade\n| language  = Serbian\n| chapter   = Albanski pokreti 1908\u20131912.\n|trans-chapter=| chapterurl    = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/bogdanovic-kosovo_2.html\n| quote         =...&nbsp;ustanici su uspeli da&nbsp;... ovladaju celim kosovskim vilajetom do polovine avgusta 1912, \u0161to zna\u010di da su tada imali u svojim rukama Pri\u0161tinu, Novi Pazar, Sjenicu pa \u010dak i Skoplje&nbsp;...

The Yugoslav communist slogan at the time was '''uni\u0161ti stari graditi novi''' (destroy the old, build the new). In a misguided effort to modernize the town, communists set out to destroy the Ottoman bazaar and large parts of the historic center, including mosques, catholic churches and Ottoman houses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> A second agreement signed between Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1953 led to the exodus of several hundreds more Albanian families from Pristina. They left behind their homes, properties and businesses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> However, this policy changed under the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|new constitution]] ratified in 1974. Few of the Ottoman town houses survived the communists' modernization drive, with the exception of those that were nationalized like today's Emin Gjiku Museum or the building of the Institute for the Protection of Monuments.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs capital city and seat of the government, Pristina creamed off a large share of Yugoslav development funds channeled into Kosovo. As a result, the city's population and its economy changed rapidly. In 1966, Pristina had few paved roads, the old town houses had running water and [[cholera]] was still a problem. [[Prizren]] continued to be the largest town in Kosovo. Massive investments in state institutions like the newly founded [[University of Pristina (1969\u20131999)|University of Pristina]], the construction of new high-rise socialist apartment blocks and a new industrial zone on the outskirts of Pristina attracted large number of internal migrants. This ended a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]] and gave a major boost to Albanian-language education and culture in Kosovo. The Albanians were also allowed to use the Albanian flag.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWithin a decade, Pristina nearly doubled its population from about 69,514 in 1971 to 109,208 in 1981.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> This golden age of externally financed rapid growth was cut short by Yugoslavia's economic collapse and the [[1981 protests in Kosovo|1981 student revolts]]. Pristina, like the rest of Kosovo slid into a deepening economic and social crisis. The year 1989 saw the revocation of Kosovo's autonomy under [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the rise of [[Serb nationalism]] and mass dismissal of ethnic Albanians.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Kosovo War===\n{{Main|Kosovo War}}\n\n[[File:089 albanian graves kosovo.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Graves of those who died in the [[Kosovo War]] in Pristina.]]\n[[File:War-Torn Pristina, Kosovo.jpg|upright|thumb|160px|right|War-torn Pristina.]]\n\nFollowing the reduction of Kosovo's autonomy by [[President of Serbia|Serbian President]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in 1989, a harshly repressive regime was imposed throughout Kosovo by the Yugoslav government with Albanians largely being purged from state industries and institutions.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The LDK's{{Clarify|date=February 2018}} role meant, that when the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] began to attack Serbian and Yugoslav forces from 1996 onwards, Pristina remained largely calm until the outbreak of the [[Kosovo War]] in March 1999. Pristina was spared large scale destruction compared to towns like [[Gjakova]] or [[Pe\u0107]] that suffered heavily at the hands of Serbian forces. For their strategic importance, however, a number of military targets were hit in Pristina during NATO's aerial campaign, including the post office, police headquarters and army barracks (today's [[Adem Jashari]] garrison on the road to [[Kosovo Polje]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWidespread violence broke out in Pristina. Serbian and Yugoslav forces shelled several districts and, in conjunction with paramilitaries, conducted large-scale expulsions of ethnic Albanians accompanied by widespread looting and destruction of Albanian properties.

Between the late 11th and middle of the 13th century it was ceded several times to the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].\n\nPristina was an important town in late [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Medieval Serbia]]. The ''[[\u017eupe]]'' (counties) of Sitnica and Lipljan, which had territory around present-day Pristina, are mentioned in ''Life of Saint Simeon'', a text written by the Serbian historical figure [[Saint Sava]] between 1201 and 1208.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The city was also a royal estate of [[Stefan Milutin]], [[Stefan Uro\u0161 III]], [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], [[Stefan Uro\u0161 V]] and [[Vuk Brankovi\u0107]].<ref name=\"Izdanja\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIFpAAAAMAAJ|page=22|title=Kosovo i metohija tokom vekova: Zublja|last1=Leki\u0107|first1=\u0110or\u0111e|year=1995}}</ref> The medieval fort of Vi\u0161egrad, whose ruins lie three kilometres east of the city centre, was mentioned in Milutin's time,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgMIAAAAMAAJ|page=167|title=Yugoslavia: Cultural Monuments of Serbia|last1=Pani\u0107-Surep|first1=Milorad|year=1965}}</ref> and served as his capital,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx4qAQAAMAAJ|page=392|title=Serbia: The country, people, life, customs|isbn=9788678910319|last1=Vlahovi\u0107|first1=Petar|year=2004}}</ref> and the nearby [[Gra\u010danica monastery]] was founded by him in ca. 1315.\n\nThe first historical record mentioning Pristina by its name dates back to 1342 when the Byzantine Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] described Pristina as a 'village'.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />{{better source|date=December 2013}}\n\nBetween the end of the 14th and the middle of the 15th century, Ottoman rule was gradually imposed in the town.\n\n===Ottoman Era===\n{{See also|Ottoman Kosovo}} \nIn the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, Pristina developed as an important mining and trading center thanks to its proximity to the rich mining town of [[Novo Brdo]], and due to its position of the Balkan trade routes. The old town stretching out between the Vellusha and Prishtevka rivers which are both covered over today, became an important crafts and trade center. Pristina was famous for its annual trade fairs (''Panair'')<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> and its goat hide and goat hair articles. Around 50 different crafts were practiced from tanning to leather dying, belt making and silk weaving, as well as crafts related to the military \u2013 armorers, smiths, and saddle makers. As early as 1485, Pristina artisans also started producing gunpowder. Trade was thriving and there was a growing colony of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] traders (from modern day [[Dubrovnik]]) providing the link between Pristina's craftsmen and the outside world.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The first mosque was constructed in the late 14th century while still under Serbian rule.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The 1487 defter recorded 412 Christian and 94 Muslim households in Pristina, which at the time was administratively part of the [[Sanjak of Vu\u010ditrn]].\nIn the early Ottoman era, [[Islam]] was an urban phenomenon and only spread slowly with increasing urbanization. The travel writer [[Evliya Celebi]], visiting Pristina in the 1660s was impressed with its fine gardens and vineyards.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />  In those years, Pristina was part of the V\u0131\u00e7\u0131t\u0131r\u0131n Sanjak and its 2,000 families enjoyed the peace and stability of the Ottoman era. Economic life was controlled by the guild system (''esnafs'') with the tanners' and bakers' guild controlling prices, limiting unfair competition and acting as banks for their members. Religious life was dominated by religious charitable organizations often building mosques or fountains and providing charity to the poor.\nDuring the [[Austro-Turkish War (1683\u20131699)|Austro-Turkish War]] in the late 17th century, Pristina citizens under the leadership of the Catholic Albanian priest [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] pledged loyalty to the Austrian army and supplied troops. He contributed a force of 6,000 Albanian soldiers to the Austrian army which had arrived in Pristina. Under Austrian occupation, the Fatih Mosque (''Mbretit Mosque'') was briefly converted to a [[Jesuit]] church.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> Following the Austrian defeat in January 1690, Pristina's inhabitants were left at the mercy of Ottoman and [[Tatar]] troops who took revenge against the local population as punishment for their co-operation with the Austrians. A French officer traveling to Pristina noted soon afterwards that \"Pristina looked impressive from a distance but close up it is a mass of muddy streets and houses made of earth\".<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Modern===\n\n[[File:Monument of Brotherhood and Unity in Pristina.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Monument of '''[[Brotherhood and Unity]]''' by [[Miodrag \u017divkovi\u0107 (sculptor)|Miodrag \u017divkovi\u0107]] in the centre. ''Brotherhood and unity'' was a popular slogan of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]].]]\n\nThe year 1874 marked a turning point. That year the railway between [[Salonika]] and [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] started operations and the seat of the vilayet of Prizren was relocated to Pristina. This privileged position as capital of the Ottoman vilayet lasted only for a short while. from January until August 1912, Pristina was liberated from Ottoman rule by Albanian rebel forces led by [[Hasan Prishtina]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Bogdanovi\u0107\n| first      = Dimitrije\n| authorlink = Dimitrije Bogdanovi\u0107\n| editor        = Antonije Isakovi\u0107\n| title         = Knjiga o Kosovu\n| url           = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/index.html\n| accessdate    = January 9, 2011\n| volume    = 2\n| origyear  = 1984\n|date=November 2000\n| publisher = [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n| location  = Belgrade\n| language  = Serbian\n| chapter   = Albanski pokreti 1908\u20131912.\n|trans-chapter=| chapterurl    = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/bogdanovic-kosovo_2.html\n| quote         =...&nbsp;ustanici su uspeli da&nbsp;... ovladaju celim kosovskim vilajetom do polovine avgusta 1912, \u0161to zna\u010di da su tada imali u svojim rukama Pri\u0161tinu, Novi Pazar, Sjenicu pa \u010dak i Skoplje&nbsp;...

The Yugoslav communist slogan at the time was '''uni\u0161ti stari graditi novi''' (destroy the old, build the new). In a misguided effort to modernize the town, communists set out to destroy the Ottoman bazaar and large parts of the historic center, including mosques, catholic churches and Ottoman houses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> A second agreement signed between Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1953 led to the exodus of several hundreds more Albanian families from Pristina. They left behind their homes, properties and businesses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> However, this policy changed under the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|new constitution]] ratified in 1974. Few of the Ottoman town houses survived the communists' modernization drive, with the exception of those that were nationalized like today's Emin Gjiku Museum or the building of the Institute for the Protection of Monuments.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs capital city and seat of the government, Pristina creamed off a large share of Yugoslav development funds channeled into Kosovo. As a result, the city's population and its economy changed rapidly. In 1966, Pristina had few paved roads, the old town houses had running water and [[cholera]] was still a problem. [[Prizren]] continued to be the largest town in Kosovo. Massive investments in state institutions like the newly founded [[University of Pristina (1969\u20131999)|University of Pristina]], the construction of new high-rise socialist apartment blocks and a new industrial zone on the outskirts of Pristina attracted large number of internal migrants. This ended a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]] and gave a major boost to Albanian-language education and culture in Kosovo. The Albanians were also allowed to use the Albanian flag.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWithin a decade, Pristina nearly doubled its population from about 69,514 in 1971 to 109,208 in 1981.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> This golden age of externally financed rapid growth was cut short by Yugoslavia's economic collapse and the [[1981 protests in Kosovo|1981 student revolts]]. Pristina, like the rest of Kosovo slid into a deepening economic and social crisis. The year 1989 saw the revocation of Kosovo's autonomy under [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the rise of [[Serb nationalism]] and mass dismissal of ethnic Albanians.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Kosovo War===\n{{Main|Kosovo War}}\n\n[[File:089 albanian graves kosovo.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Graves of those who died in the [[Kosovo War]] in Pristina.]]\n[[File:War-Torn Pristina, Kosovo.jpg|upright|thumb|160px|right|War-torn Pristina.]]\n\nFollowing the reduction of Kosovo's autonomy by [[President of Serbia|Serbian President]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in 1989, a harshly repressive regime was imposed throughout Kosovo by the Yugoslav government with Albanians largely being purged from state industries and institutions.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The LDK's{{Clarify|date=February 2018}} role meant, that when the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] began to attack Serbian and Yugoslav forces from 1996 onwards, Pristina remained largely calm until the outbreak of the [[Kosovo War]] in March 1999. Pristina was spared large scale destruction compared to towns like [[Gjakova]] or [[Pe\u0107]] that suffered heavily at the hands of Serbian forces. For their strategic importance, however, a number of military targets were hit in Pristina during NATO's aerial campaign, including the post office, police headquarters and army barracks (today's [[Adem Jashari]] garrison on the road to [[Kosovo Polje]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWidespread violence broke out in Pristina. Serbian and Yugoslav forces shelled several districts and, in conjunction with paramilitaries, conducted large-scale expulsions of ethnic Albanians accompanied by widespread looting and destruction of Albanian properties.

With the development of culture and especially after the last war in 1999, Pristina had a progress on holding these kinds of events. Every year various types of trade fairs take place in the capital city. The essence of these fairs is usually temporary; some last only an afternoon while others may last around 3 days, a week or even longer. They have grown in size and importance over the years.
