Hoad won four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments as an amateur (Australian, French and twice Wimbledon). He was a member of the [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australian team]] that won the [[Davis Cup]] four times between 1952 and 1956. Hoad turned professional in July 1957 and won the [[Tournament of Champions (tennis)|Forest Hills Tournament of Champions]] event in 1959. He also won the Ampol Tournament of Champions at Kooyong in 1958 and the Ampol Open Trophy world series of tournaments in 1959\u20131960, defending his Kooyong championship in the world series. During his career his main competitors were his longtime amateur tennis teammate [[Ken Rosewall]] and, throughout his professional career, [[Pancho Gonzales]].\n\nHoad was ranked in the world top ten for amateurs from 1952 until 1957, reaching the world No. 1 spot in 1956. He was ranked the world No. 1 professional in Kramer's 1959\u20131960 Ampol ranking. He was ranked the world No. 1 tennis player, professional or amateur, for 1962 in a poll of 85 U.S. sports editors.\n\nSerious back problems plagued Hoad throughout his career, possibly caused by a weight-lifting exercise he devised in 1954, particularly after he turned professional, and led to his effective retirement from tennis in 1967, although afterwards he made sporadic comeback attempts, enticed by the advent of the Open Era in 1968.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1972, Hoad and his wife [[Jenny Staley Hoad|Jenny]] operated a tennis resort, ''Lew Hoad's Campo de Tenis'' in [[Fuengirola]], Spain, near M\u00e1laga. Hoad died of leukemia on 3 July 1994.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Australian tennis player Lewis Hoad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Hoad at age 15 competing at Kooyong in Inter State Tennis in 1949]]\nLewis Hoad{{efn|name=actor|Lewis Hoad was named after the American actor [[Lewis Stone]].{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}}}} was born on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]], the eldest of three sons of tramway electrician Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle Burbury.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}} Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|pp=105,106|ps=}} As a young child, he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained, and he was allowed to practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|pp=3,4|ps=}}{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=106|ps=}} At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] in the under 16 category.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17933284 |title=School for Tennis Juniors. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 December 1944 |accessdate=14 June 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he often played with [[Ken Rosewall]], and they became known as the Sydney \"twins\", although they had very different physiques, personalities and playing styles. Their first match was in their early teens and was played as an opener of an exhibition match between Australia and America. Rosewall won 6\u20130, 6\u20130.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=107|ps=}} Hoad built up great physical strength, especially in his hands and arms, by training at a police boys' club, where he made a name as a boxer. Hoad was about 12 when he was introduced to [[Adrian Quist]], a former Australian tennis champion and then general manager of the [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] sports goods company. Quist played a couple of sets with Hoad and was impressed by his natural ability. When Hoad was 14 he left school and joined the Dunlop payroll, following the pattern of that 'shamateur' era when most of Australia's brightest tennis prospects were employed by sporting goods companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: Lew Hoad|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lew-hoad-1411724.html|publisher=The Independent|date=5 July 1994}}</ref>\n\nHoad had just turned 15 when he and Rosewall were selected to play for [[New South Wales]] in an interstate contest against [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18128860 |title=Rosewall, Hoad in state team. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 November 1949 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In November 1949, Hoad won the junior title at the New South Wales Championships, and the same weekend, he also competed in the final of the junior [[table tennis]] championship in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48607374 |title=N.S.W.

Hoad won four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments as an amateur (Australian, French and twice Wimbledon). He was a member of the [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australian team]] that won the [[Davis Cup]] four times between 1952 and 1956. Hoad turned professional in July 1957 and won the [[Tournament of Champions (tennis)|Forest Hills Tournament of Champions]] event in 1959. He also won the Ampol Tournament of Champions at Kooyong in 1958 and the Ampol Open Trophy world series of tournaments in 1959\u20131960, defending his Kooyong championship in the world series. During his career his main competitors were his longtime amateur tennis teammate [[Ken Rosewall]] and, throughout his professional career, [[Pancho Gonzales]].\n\nHoad was ranked in the world top ten for amateurs from 1952 until 1957, reaching the world No. 1 spot in 1956. He was ranked the world No. 1 professional in Kramer's 1959\u20131960 Ampol ranking. He was ranked the world No. 1 tennis player, professional or amateur, for 1962 in a poll of 85 U.S. sports editors.\n\nSerious back problems plagued Hoad throughout his career, possibly caused by a weight-lifting exercise he devised in 1954, particularly after he turned professional, and led to his effective retirement from tennis in 1967, although afterwards he made sporadic comeback attempts, enticed by the advent of the Open Era in 1968.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1972, Hoad and his wife [[Jenny Staley Hoad|Jenny]] operated a tennis resort, ''Lew Hoad's Campo de Tenis'' in [[Fuengirola]], Spain, near M\u00e1laga. Hoad died of leukemia on 3 July 1994.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Australian tennis player Lewis Hoad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Hoad at age 15 competing at Kooyong in Inter State Tennis in 1949]]\nLewis Hoad{{efn|name=actor|Lewis Hoad was named after the American actor [[Lewis Stone]].{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}}}} was born on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]], the eldest of three sons of tramway electrician Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle Burbury.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}} Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|pp=105,106|ps=}} As a young child, he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained, and he was allowed to practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|pp=3,4|ps=}}{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=106|ps=}} At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] in the under 16 category.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17933284 |title=School for Tennis Juniors. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 December 1944 |accessdate=14 June 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he often played with [[Ken Rosewall]], and they became known as the Sydney \"twins\", although they had very different physiques, personalities and playing styles. Their first match was in their early teens and was played as an opener of an exhibition match between Australia and America. Rosewall won 6\u20130, 6\u20130.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=107|ps=}} Hoad built up great physical strength, especially in his hands and arms, by training at a police boys' club, where he made a name as a boxer. Hoad was about 12 when he was introduced to [[Adrian Quist]], a former Australian tennis champion and then general manager of the [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] sports goods company. Quist played a couple of sets with Hoad and was impressed by his natural ability. When Hoad was 14 he left school and joined the Dunlop payroll, following the pattern of that 'shamateur' era when most of Australia's brightest tennis prospects were employed by sporting goods companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: Lew Hoad|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lew-hoad-1411724.html|publisher=The Independent|date=5 July 1994}}</ref>\n\nHoad had just turned 15 when he and Rosewall were selected to play for [[New South Wales]] in an interstate contest against [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18128860 |title=Rosewall, Hoad in state team. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 November 1949 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In November 1949, Hoad won the junior title at the New South Wales Championships, and the same weekend, he also competed in the final of the junior [[table tennis]] championship in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48607374 |title=N.S.W.
