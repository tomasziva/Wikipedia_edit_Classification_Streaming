Winnipeg in the north-central part of the city. It is bounded by the Red River on the east, the north limit of Kildonan Golf Course, Main Street, Seaforth Avenue, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] Winnipeg Beach Subdivision, and Templeton Avenue on the north, McPhillips Street on the west, and Carruthers Avenue, McGregor Street, and the lane between McAdam and Smithfield Avenues on the south.\n\nThe area is well known for Winnipeg's popular [[Kildonan Park]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe [[Battle of Seven Oaks]] was fought in what is now West Kildonan in 1816. The area was part of the original [[Old Kildonan|Municipality of Kildonan]] which was established in 1876. Kildonan was divided in eastern and western halves in 1914 and the more heavily developed areas of West Kildonan separated from areas which remained primarily rural (Old Kildonan) to assume the current boundaries in 1921. West Kildonan is one of Winnipeg's earliest residential suburbs.\n\nThe areas east of the CPR Winnipeg Beach tracks and south of Hartford Avenue were substantially developed by the 1910s and 1920s. West of the tracks, the [[Garden City, Winnipeg|Garden City]] neighbourhood was developed in the 1950s and 1960s, as was the area north of Hartford Avenue east of the tracks. The Garden Park community located north of Leila Avenue and west of the CPR tracks was developed beginning in the late 1950s.\n\nThe R.M.'s municipal hall was located at 1760 Main St.\n\nIn January 1961 the Rural Municipality of West Kildonan asked the Province to designate it as a City. At the time the R.M. had a total tax assessment of C$15 million with a population of 19,000 citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=January 26, 1961|title=W. K.

To this day, the area has a large Eastern European population.\n\nThis area, along with nearby [[Garden City, Winnipeg|Garden City]] are home to large portions of [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg's]] Jewish population. Historically, the West Kildonan and Garden City areas have been two of Canada's largest Jewish neighbourhoods. [[Synagogues]], Hebrew educational programming, Kosher supermarkets and Jewish cemeteries are common throughout the area. In recent years condominiums catering to the Jewish community have become increasingly popular.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Neighbourhood\n!2016\nPop.\n!Area\n(sq. km.)\n|-\n|Seven Oaks\n|3,000\n|1.2\n|-\n|Jefferson\n|8,985\n|2.4\n|-\n|Garden City\n|6,255\n|2.3\n|-\n|Margaret Park\n|2,210\n|0.9\n|-\n|Templeton-Sinclair\n|6,010\n|1.7\n|-\n|Leila-McPhilips\n|2,980\n|1.0\n|-\n|Leila North\n|1,230\n|1.4\n|-\n|Riverbend\n|5,555\n|1.7\n|-\n|Rivergrove\n|2,330\n|1.5\n|-\n|'''TOTAL'''\n|38,555\n|14.1\n|}\n\n== Notable residents ==\nProfessional wrestling journalist, wrestler and referee Jordan Garber was raised in West Kildonan.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Garden City, Winnipeg|Garden City]]\n*[[Winnipeg]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Former municipalities now in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Jewish Canadian history]]\n[[Category:Jewish communities in Canada]]\n[[Category:Jews and Judaism in Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Populated places disestablished in 1972]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Suburb of Winnipeg, Canada}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = West Kildonan\n| native_name                     = \n| native_name_lang                = <!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"fr\" for French.

Kildonan was divided in eastern and western halves in 1914 and the more heavily developed areas of West Kildonan separated from areas which remained primarily rural (Old Kildonan) to assume the current boundaries in 1921. West Kildonan is one of Winnipeg's earliest residential suburbs.\n\nThe areas east of the CPR Winnipeg Beach tracks and south of Hartford Avenue were substantially developed by the 1910s and 1920s. West of the tracks, the [[Garden City, Winnipeg|Garden City]] neighbourhood was developed in the 1950s and 1960s, as was the area north of Hartford Avenue east of the tracks. The Garden Park community located north of Leila Avenue and west of the CPR tracks was developed beginning in the late 1950s.\n\nThe R.M.'s municipal hall was located at 1760 Main St.\n\nIn January 1961 the Rural Municipality of West Kildonan asked the Province to designate it as a City. At the time the R.M. had a total tax assessment of C$15 million with a population of 19,000 citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=January 26, 1961|title=W. K.

Today, it is a popular suburb of the City of Winnipeg. \n\n==Demographics==\n\nEarly on, West Kildonan attracted many people from Winnipeg's [[working class]] North End who became more affluent beginning after [[World War I]], but who wished to remain close to their roots. To this day, the area has a large Eastern European population.\n\nThis area, along with nearby [[Garden City, Winnipeg|Garden City]] are home to large portions of [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg's]] Jewish population. Historically, the West Kildonan and Garden City areas have been two of Canada's largest Jewish neighbourhoods. [[Synagogues]], Hebrew educational programming, Kosher supermarkets and Jewish cemeteries are common throughout the area. In recent years condominiums catering to the Jewish community have become increasingly popular.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Neighbourhood\n!2016\nPop.\n!Area\n(sq. km.)\n|-\n|Seven Oaks\n|3,000\n|1.2\n|-\n|Jefferson\n|8,985\n|2.4\n|-\n|Garden City\n|6,255\n|2.3\n|-\n|Margaret Park\n|2,210\n|0.9\n|-\n|Templeton-Sinclair\n|6,010\n|1.7\n|-\n|Leila-McPhilips\n|2,980\n|1.0\n|-\n|Leila North\n|1,230\n|1.4\n|-\n|Riverbend\n|5,555\n|1.7\n|-\n|Rivergrove\n|2,330\n|1.5\n|-\n|'''TOTAL'''\n|38,555\n|14.1\n|}\n\n== Notable residents ==\nProfessional wrestling journalist, wrestler and referee Jordan Garber was raised in West Kildonan.<ref>{{Cite news|last=O'Shaughnessy|first=Michael|date=December 31, 1971|title=West Kildonan, Scotland Linked With 1,300 Year-Old Name|page=20|work=Winnipeg Free Press|url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Garden City, Winnipeg|Garden City]]\n*[[Winnipeg]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Former municipalities now in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Jewish Canadian history]]\n[[Category:Jewish communities in Canada]]\n[[Category:Jews and Judaism in Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Populated places disestablished in 1972]]\n", "name_user": "Jimj wpg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Kildonan,_Winnipeg"}
