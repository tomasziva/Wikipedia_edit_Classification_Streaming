In 1930, the Shredded Wheat Company was acquired by the National Biscuit Company (later [[Nabisco]]), which again sued Kellogg, both in Canada and in the United States, for unfair competition.\n\nNabisco complained in its lawsuit about Kellogg's use of the term \"Shredded Wheat\"; the similarity of its cereal biscuits' shape to the Nabisco cereal biscuits; and Kellogg's use on the product box of a picture of two of the pillow-shaped cereal biscuits submerged in milk.  The complaint about the picture was based on [[trademark]] law; the other two complaints were that Kellogg's was fraudulently trying to \"pass off\" its cereal as Nabisco's.  Nabisco had previously failed in its attempt to register \"Shredded Wheat\" as a trademark, as the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] had rejected the registration, as descriptive.\n\n== Opinion of the Court ==\n\nIn a 7\u20132 opinion written by [[Justice Brandeis]], the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Nabisco's arguments, and allowed Kellogg to continue to manufacture its shredded wheat cereal, and name it \"Shredded Wheat\".\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shredded wheat in a bowl.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Two shredded wheat biscuits in a bowl of milk]] -->\nOn the protection of the cereal's shape, the Court decided that the shape was functional and that there was a right to copy it after its patent expired, as the use of unfair competition and trademark laws could otherwise be used to impede the ability of rivals to create ''any'' competitive product, even though the patent had expired.\n\nOn the picture of the two shredded wheat biscuits in the bowl of milk, the Court noted that \"the name Kellogg was so prominent on all of the defendant's cartons as to minimize the possibility of confusion\", and hence there was no fraudulent \"passing off\" of Kellogg's cereal biscuits as having been created by Nabisco.\n\nOn the use of the term \"Shredded Wheat\", the Court ruled that the term was generic and not trademarkable; and dismissed a claim by Nabisco that it had acquired a \"secondary meaning\" under case law.\n\nThe Court concluded:\n\n{{Quote|Kellogg Company is undoubtedly sharing in the goodwill of the article known as 'Shredded Wheat'; and thus is sharing in a market which was created by the skill and judgment of plaintiff's predecessor and has been widely extended by vast expenditures in advertising persistently made.
