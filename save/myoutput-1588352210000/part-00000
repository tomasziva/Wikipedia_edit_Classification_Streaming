Hungarian belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]]. There are an estimated 14.2\u201314.5 million ethnic Hungarians and their descendants worldwide, of whom 9.6 million live in today's Hungary (as of 2016).<ref name=KSH/> About 2.2 million Hungarians live in areas that were part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] before the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and are now parts of Hungary's seven neighbouring countries, [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Serbia|Serbia]], [[Hungarians of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Hungarian diaspora|Slovenia]] and [[Hungarian diaspora|Austria]]. [[Hungarian diaspora|Significant groups]] of people with Hungarian ancestry live in various other parts of the world, most of them in the [[Hungarian American|United States]], [[Hungarian Canadians|Canada]], [[Hungarians in Germany|Germany]], [[France]], the [[Hungarians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Hungarian Brazilian|Brazil]], [[Hungarian Australian|Australia]], and [[Hungarians in Argentina|Argentina]].\n\nHungarians can be classified into several subgroups according to local linguistic and cultural characteristics; subgroups with distinct identities include the [[Sz\u00e9kelys]], the [[Csangos|Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3s]], the [[Pal\u00f3c]] and the [[Maty\u00f3]]. The [[Jasz people|J\u00e1sz]] people are considered to be an originally [[Iranian peoples|Iranic]] ethnic group more closely related to the [[Ossetians]] than to other Hungarians.\n\n== Name ==\n{{further|Name of Hungary}}\nThe Hungarians' own ethnonym to denote themselves in the Early Middle Ages is uncertain. The [[exonym]] \"Hungarian\" is thought to be derived from Oghur-Turkic ''[[Ono\u011furs|On-Ogur]]'' (literally \"Ten Arrows\" or \"Ten Tribes\"). Another possible explanation comes from the [[Old Russian]] \"[[Yugra]]\" (\"\u042e\u0433\u0440\u0430\"). It may refer to the Hungarians during a time when they dwelt east of the [[Ural Mountains]] along the natural borders of Europe and Asia before their conquest of the Carpathian Basin.<ref>[[OED]], s. v. \"Ugrian\": \"''Ugri'', the name given by early Russian writers to a Finno-Ugric people dwelling east of the Ural Mountains\".</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] in 895/6 and while they lived on the [[Etelk\u00f6z|steppes of Eastern Europe]] east of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], written sources called the Magyars \"Hungarians\", specifically: \"Ungri\" by [[Georgius Monachus]] in 837, \"Ungri\" by ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' in 862, and \"Ungari\" by the ''[[Annales ex Annalibus Iuvavensibus]]'' in 881.

Hungarian belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]]. There are an estimated 14.2\u201314.5 million ethnic Hungarians and their descendants worldwide, of whom 9.6 million live in today's Hungary (as of 2016).<ref name=KSH/> About 2.2 million Hungarians live in areas that were part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] before the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and are now parts of Hungary's seven neighbouring countries, [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Serbia|Serbia]], [[Hungarians of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Hungarian diaspora|Slovenia]] and [[Hungarian diaspora|Austria]]. [[Hungarian diaspora|Significant groups]] of people with Hungarian ancestry live in various other parts of the world, most of them in the [[Hungarian American|United States]], [[Hungarian Canadians|Canada]], [[Hungarians in Germany|Germany]], [[France]], the [[Hungarians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Hungarian Brazilian|Brazil]], [[Hungarian Australian|Australia]], and [[Hungarians in Argentina|Argentina]].\n\nHungarians can be classified into several subgroups according to local linguistic and cultural characteristics; subgroups with distinct identities include the [[Sz\u00e9kelys]], the [[Csangos|Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3s]], the [[Pal\u00f3c]] and the [[Maty\u00f3]]. The [[Jasz people|J\u00e1sz]] people are considered to be an originally [[Iranian peoples|Iranic]] ethnic group more closely related to the [[Ossetians]] than to other Hungarians.\n\n== Name ==\n{{further|Name of Hungary}}\nThe Hungarians' own ethnonym to denote themselves in the Early Middle Ages is uncertain. The [[exonym]] \"Hungarian\" is thought to be derived from Oghur-Turkic ''[[Ono\u011furs|On-Ogur]]'' (literally \"Ten Arrows\" or \"Ten Tribes\"). Another possible explanation comes from the [[Old Russian]] \"[[Yugra]]\" (\"\u042e\u0433\u0440\u0430\"). It may refer to the Hungarians during a time when they dwelt east of the [[Ural Mountains]] along the natural borders of Europe and Asia before their conquest of the Carpathian Basin.<ref>[[OED]], s. v. \"Ugrian\": \"''Ugri'', the name given by early Russian writers to a Finno-Ugric people dwelling east of the Ural Mountains\".</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] in 895/6 and while they lived on the [[Etelk\u00f6z|steppes of Eastern Europe]] east of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], written sources called the Magyars \"Hungarians\", specifically: \"Ungri\" by [[Georgius Monachus]] in 837, \"Ungri\" by ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' in 862, and \"Ungari\" by the ''[[Annales ex Annalibus Iuvavensibus]]'' in 881.

In an attempt to divide N into subgroups L1034 and L708, some Hungarian, [[Sz\u00e9kely]], and Uzbek samples were found to be L1034 SNP positive, while all Mongolians, [[Buryats]], [[Khanty people|Khanty]], Finnish, and Roma samples showed a negative result for this marker.
