{"title_page": "Tax evasion", "text_new": "{{short description|Financial crime}}\n{{Distinguish|tax avoidance}}\n{{Globalize|article|Western culture|date=August 2017}}\n{{Taxation}}\n'''Tax evasion''' is the illegal evasion of [[tax]]es by individuals, [[corporation]]s, and [[Trust (property)|trusts]]. Tax evasion often entails taxpayers deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their [[tax liability]] and includes dishonest tax reporting, such as declaring less income, profits or gains than the amounts actually earned, or overstating deductions.\n\nTax evasion is an activity commonly associated with the [[informal economy]].<ref>[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3529340 Tax Evasion & Whistleblowers: Curious Policy or Durable Strategy?] ''Tax Law: International & Comparative Tax eJournal.'' SSRN. Accessed 5 May 2020.</ref> One measure of the extent of tax evasion (the \"tax gap\") is the amount of unreported income, which is the difference between the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the actual amount reported.\n\nIn contrast, [[tax avoidance]] is the legal use of tax laws to reduce one's tax burden. Both tax evasion and avoidance can be viewed as forms of [[tax noncompliance]], as they describe a range of activities that intend to subvert a state's tax system, although such classification of tax avoidance is not indisputable, given that avoidance is lawful, within self-creating systems.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/41624/2/WP6.pdf|pages=4\u20135|author=Michael Wenzel|title=The Impact of Outcome Orientation and Justice Concerns on Tax Compliance|year=2002|publisher=Journal of Applied Psychology|quote=When taxpayers try to find loopholes with the intention to pay less tax, even if technically legal, their actions may be against the spirit of the law and in this sense considered noncompliant.}}</ref>\n\n==Economics==\n[[File:German GDP in tax havens.png|thumb|350px|The ratio of German assets in [[tax haven]]s in relation to the total German GDP, 1996\u20132008.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Shafik|last = Hebous |year=2011 |ssrn=1934164 |title=Money at the Docks of Tax Havens: A Guide |journal= CESifo Working Paper Series |volume = 70 |number =3587|page= 9|doi = 10.1628/001522114X684547 }}</ref> The \"Big 7\" shown are Hong Kong, Ireland, Lebanon, Liberia, Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland.]]\n\nIn 1968, Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker first theorized the ''economics of crime'',<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Gary Becker |title=Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach |journal=The Journal of Political Economy |year=1968 |volume=76 |issue=2 |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c3625.pdf |pages= 169\u2013217 |doi=10.1086/259394}}</ref> on the basis of which authors M.G.

Alternative specifications, however, yield conflicting results concerning both the signs and magnitudes of variables believed to affect tax evasion.

Producers who collect VAT from consumers may evade tax by under-reporting the amount of sales.<ref>Spiro, Peter S. (2005), \"Tax Policy and the Underground Economy,\" in Christopher Bajada and Friedrich Schneider, eds., ''Size, Causes and Consequences of the Underground Economy'' (Ashgate Publishing).</ref>\nThe US has no broad-based consumption tax at the federal level, and no state currently collects VAT; the overwhelming majority of [[U.S. state|states]] instead collect [[Sales taxes in the United States|sales taxes]]. [[Canada]] uses both a VAT at the federal level (the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]]) and [[Sales taxes in Canada|sales taxes at the provincial level]]; some provinces have [[Harmonized Sales Tax|a single tax combining both forms]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn addition, most jurisdictions which levy a VAT or sales tax also legally require their residents to report and pay the tax on items purchased in another jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} This means that consumers who purchase something in a lower-taxed or untaxed jurisdiction with the intention of avoiding VAT or sales tax in their home jurisdiction are technically breaking the law in most cases.\n\nThis is especially prevalent in [[federal state|federal countries]] like the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]] where sub-national jurisdictions charge varying rates of VAT or sales tax.\n\nIn liberal democracies, a fundamental problem with inhibiting evasion of local sales taxes is that liberal democracies, by their very nature, have few (if any) border controls between their internal jurisdictions. Therefore, it is not generally cost-effective to enforce tax collection on low-value goods carried in private vehicles from one jurisdiction to another with a different tax rate. However, sub-national governments will normally seek to collect sales tax on high-value items such as cars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tom\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 |first=Eva |year=2008 |url=http://www.aicels.org/aicels/Interduction_to_czech_law_-_AICELS%20-%20Abstract1.pdf |title=Tax Evasion in the Czech Republic \u2013 In: A Brief Introduction to Czech Law.

[[Political corruption|Corruption]] by tax officials is a serious problem for the tax administration in many{{which|date=June 2013}} less developed countries.\n\n===Level of evasion and punishment===\nTax evasion is a crime in almost all developed countries, and the guilty party is liable to [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and/or [[imprisonment]]. In [[Switzerland]], many acts that would amount to criminal tax evasion in other countries are treated as civil matters. Dishonestly misreporting income in a tax return is not necessarily considered a crime. Such matters are handled in the Swiss tax courts, not the criminal courts.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn Switzerland, however, some tax misconduct (such as the deliberate falsification of records) is criminal. Moreover, civil tax transgressions may give rise to penalties. It is often considered that the extent of evasion depends on the severity of punishment for evasion.\n\n===Privatization of tax enforcement===\n[[File:Venedig BW 1.JPG|thumb|upright|A \"Lion's Mouth\" postbox for anonymous denunciations at the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in Venice, Italy.

Governments received a lump sum in advance from a private entity, which then collects and retains the revenue and bears the risk of evasion by the taxpayers. It has been suggested that tax farming may reduce tax evasion in less developed countries.<ref name=\"Stella\" />\n\nThis system may be liable to abuse by the \"tax-farmers\" seeking to make a profit, if they are not subject to political constraints.

Therefore, it is not generally cost-effective to enforce tax collection on low-value goods carried in private vehicles from one jurisdiction to another with a different tax rate.
