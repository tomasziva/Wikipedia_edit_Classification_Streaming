He was an impetuous soldier, earning the nickname Lightning in a battle against the [[Karamanids]].\n \nBayezid ascended to the throne following the death of his father Murad I, who was killed by Serbian knight [[Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107]] during (15 June), or immediately after (16 June), the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, by which Serbia became a vassal of the Ottoman Sultanate. Immediately after obtaining the throne, he had his younger brother strangled to avoid a plot. In 1390, Bayezid took as a wife Princess [[Olivera Despina]], the daughter of Prince [[Lazar of Serbia]],<ref>Halil Inalcik, \"Bayezid I\", ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol. I, Ed. H.A.R. Gibb, J.H. Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal and J. Schacht, (Brill, 1986), 1118.</ref> who also lost his life in Kosovo. Bayezid recognized [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]], the son of Lazar, as the new Serbian leader (later despot), with considerable autonomy.\n\n[[File:Qur'anic Manuscript - Mid to Late 15th Century, Turkey.jpg|thumb|262px|A manuscript of the [[Quran]] from the reign of Bayezid I]]\nThe upper Serbia resisted the Ottomans until general [[Pasha Yi\u011fit Bey]] captured the city of Skopje in 1391, converting the city to an important base of operations.\n\n==Efforts to unify Anatolia==\n\nMeanwhile, the sultan began unifying Anatolia under his rule. Forcible expansion into Muslim territories could endanger the Ottoman relationship with the [[gazi]]s, who were an important        source of warriors for this ruling house on the European frontier. So Bayezid began the practice to first secure ''fatwa''s, or legal rulings from Islamic scholars, justifying their wars against these Muslim states. However he suspected the loyalty of his Muslim [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] followers, for Bayezid relied heavily on his Serbian and Byzantine vassal troops to perform these conquests.<ref>Stanford Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1976), vol. 1 p. 30</ref>\n\nIn a single campaign over the summer and fall of 1390, Bayezid conquered the beyliks of [[Beylik of Ayd\u0131n|Aydin]], [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] and [[Menteshe]]. His major rival Sulayman, the emir of [[Karaman]], responded by allying himself with the ruler of [[Sivas]], [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] and the remaining Turkish beyliks. Nevertheless, Bayezid pushed on and in the fall and winter of 1390 overwhelmed the remaining beyliks -- [[Hamidids|Hamid]], [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]], and [[Germiyan]]\u2014as well as taking the cities of [[Ak\u015fehir]] and [[Ni\u011fde]], as well as their capital [[Konya]] from the Karaman. At this point, Bayezid accepted peace proposals from Karaman (1391), concerned that further advances would antagonize his Turkoman followers and lead them to ally with Kadi Burhan al-Din. Once peace had been made with Karaman, Bayezid moved north against [[Kastamonu]] which had given refuge to many fleeing from his forces, and conquered both that city as well as [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]].<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire'', vol. 1 pp. 30f</ref> However, his subsequent campaign was stopped by Burhan al-Din at the [[Battle of K\u0131rkdilim]].\n\nFrom 1389 to 1395 he conquered [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Greece]]. In 1394 Bayezid crossed the River [[Danube]] to attack [[Wallachia]], ruled at that time by [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]]. The Ottomans were superior in number, but on 10 October 1394 (or 17 May 1395), in the [[Battle of Rovine]], on forested and swampy terrain, the [[Wallachia]]ns won the fierce battle and prevented Bayezid's army from advancing beyond the Danube.<ref>John V.A. Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', (The University of Michigan Press, 1994), 424.</ref>\n\nIn 1394, Bayezid laid siege to [[Constantinople]],<ref>Mango, Cyril. ''The Oxford History of Byzantium''. 1st ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. p. 273-4</ref> the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Anadoluhisar\u0131]] fortress was built between 1393 and 1394 as part of preparations for the Second Ottoman Siege of Constantinople, which took place in 1395. On the urgings of the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaeologus]] a new [[crusade]] was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in 1396 the [[Christianity|Christian]] allies, under the leadership of the King of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (in 1433) [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], were defeated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. Bayezid built the magnificent [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] in Bursa, to celebrate this victory.\n\nThus the siege of Constantinople continued, lasting until 1402.<ref>Nancy Bisaha, ''Creating East And West: Renaissance Humanists And the Ottoman Turks'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 98.</ref> The beleaguered Byzantines had their reprieve when Bayezid fought the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid Empire]] in the East.<ref>Dimitris J. Kastritsis, ''The Sons of Bayezid: Empire Building and Representation in the Ottoman Civil War of 1402-13'', (Brill, 2007), 5.</ref> At this time, the empire of Bayezid included [[Thrace]] (except [[Constantinople]]), [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], and parts of [[Serbia]] in Europe. In Asia, his domains extended to the [[Taurus Mountains]]. His army was considered one of the best in the Islamic world.\n\n==Clash with Timur==\n\nIn 1397, Bayezid defeated the emir of Karaman in Ak\u00e7ay, killing him and annexing his territory. In 1398, the sultan conquered the Djanik emirate and the territory of Burhan al-Din, violating the accord with Timur. Finally, Bayezid occupied Elbistan and Malatya.\n\nIn 1400, the [[Turco-Mongol]] warlord [[Timur]] succeeded in rousing the local Turkic [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] who had been vassals of the Ottomans to join him in his attack on Bayezid, who was also considered one of the most powerful rulers in the Muslim world during that period. Years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Both rulers insulted each other in their own way while Timur preferred to undermine Bayezid's position as a ruler and play down the significance of his military successes. \n\nThis is the excerpt from one of Timur's letters addressed to Ottoman sultan:\n\n\"Believe me, you are but pismire ant: don't seek to fight the elephants for they'll crush you under their feet. Shall a petty prince such as you are contend with us? But your rodomontades (braggadocio) are not extraordinary; for a [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] never spake with judgement.

Many writers claim that Bayezid was mistreated by the Timurids. However, writers and historians from Timur's own court reported that Bayezid was treated well, and that Timur even mourned his death.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XDmZXIDiZG8C&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=timur+%22mourned%22+bayezid#v=onepage&q=timur%20%22mourned%22%20bayezid&f=false|title=Empires of Islam in Renaissance Historical Thought|last=MESERVE|first=Margaret|last2=Meserve|first2=Margaret|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674040953|language=en}}</ref> One of Bayezid's sons, [[Mustafa \u00c7elebi]], was captured with him and held captive in [[Samarkand]] until 1405.\n\nFour of Bayezid's sons, specifically [[S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi]], [[\u0130sa \u00c7elebi]], [[Mehmed \u00c7elebi]], and [[Musa \u00c7elebi]], however, escaped from the battlefield and later started a civil war for the Ottoman throne known as the [[Ottoman Interregnum]].<ref>Dimitris J.

They embellished the legend that he was taken by Timur to [[Samarkand]] with a cast of characters to create an oriental fantasy that has maintained its appeal. [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'' was first performed in [[London]] in 1587, three years after the formal opening of English-Ottoman trade relations when [[William Harborne]] sailed for Constantinople as an agent of the [[Levant Company]].\n\nIn 1648, the play ''Le Gran Tamerlan et Bejezet'' by [[Jean Magnon]] appeared in London, and in 1725, [[Handel]]'s ''[[Tamerlano]]'' was first performed and published in London;<ref>London: Printed & sold by J. Cluer, [1725]</ref> [[Vivaldi]]'s version of the story, ''[[Bajazet (opera)|Bajazet]]'', was written in 1735. Magnon had given Bayezid an intriguing wife and daughter; the Handel and Vivaldi renditions included, as well as Tamerlane and Bayezid and his daughter, a prince of Byzantium and a princess of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] ([[Trabzon]]) in a passionate love story. A cycle of paintings in [[Schloss Eggenberg]], near [[Graz]] in [[Austria]], translated the theme to a different medium; this was completed in the 1670s shortly before the Ottoman army attacked the [[Habsburgs]] in central [[Europe]].<ref>Finkel, C.

He was an impetuous soldier, earning the nickname Lightning in a battle against the [[Karamanids]].\n \nBayezid ascended to the throne following the death of his father Murad I, who was killed by Serbian knight [[Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107]] during (15 June), or immediately after (16 June), the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, by which Serbia became a vassal of the Ottoman Sultanate. Immediately after obtaining the throne, he had his younger brother strangled to avoid a plot. In 1390, Bayezid took as a wife Princess [[Olivera Despina]], the daughter of Prince [[Lazar of Serbia]],<ref>Halil Inalcik, \"Bayezid I\", ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol. I, Ed. H.A.R. Gibb, J.H. Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal and J. Schacht, (Brill, 1986), 1118.</ref> who also lost his life in Kosovo. Bayezid recognized [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]], the son of Lazar, as the new Serbian leader (later despot), with considerable autonomy.\n\n[[File:Qur'anic Manuscript - Mid to Late 15th Century, Turkey.jpg|thumb|262px|A manuscript of the [[Quran]] from the reign of Bayezid I]]\nThe upper Serbia resisted the Ottomans until general [[Pasha Yi\u011fit Bey]] captured the city of Skopje in 1391, converting the city to an important base of operations.\n\n==Efforts to unify Anatolia==\n\nMeanwhile, the sultan began unifying Anatolia under his rule. Forcible expansion into Muslim territories could endanger the Ottoman relationship with the [[gazi]]s, who were an important        source of warriors for this ruling house on the European frontier. So Bayezid began the practice to first secure ''fatwa''s, or legal rulings from Islamic scholars, justifying their wars against these Muslim states. However he suspected the loyalty of his Muslim [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] followers, for Bayezid relied heavily on his Serbian and Byzantine vassal troops to perform these conquests.<ref>Stanford Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1976), vol. 1 p. 30</ref>\n\nIn a single campaign over the summer and fall of 1390, Bayezid conquered the beyliks of [[Beylik of Ayd\u0131n|Aydin]], [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] and [[Menteshe]]. His major rival Sulayman, the emir of [[Karaman]], responded by allying himself with the ruler of [[Sivas]], [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] and the remaining Turkish beyliks. Nevertheless, Bayezid pushed on and in the fall and winter of 1390 overwhelmed the remaining beyliks -- [[Hamidids|Hamid]], [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]], and [[Germiyan]]\u2014as well as taking the cities of [[Ak\u015fehir]] and [[Ni\u011fde]], as well as their capital [[Konya]] from the Karaman. At this point, Bayezid accepted peace proposals from Karaman (1391), concerned that further advances would antagonize his Turkoman followers and lead them to ally with Kadi Burhan al-Din. Once peace had been made with Karaman, Bayezid moved north against [[Kastamonu]] which had given refuge to many fleeing from his forces, and conquered both that city as well as [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]].<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire'', vol. 1 pp. 30f</ref> However, his subsequent campaign was stopped by Burhan al-Din at the [[Battle of K\u0131rkdilim]].\n\nFrom 1389 to 1395 he conquered [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Greece]]. In 1394 Bayezid crossed the River [[Danube]] to attack [[Wallachia]], ruled at that time by [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]]. The Ottomans were superior in number, but on 10 October 1394 (or 17 May 1395), in the [[Battle of Rovine]], on forested and swampy terrain, the [[Wallachia]]ns won the fierce battle and prevented Bayezid's army from advancing beyond the Danube.<ref>John V.A. Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', (The University of Michigan Press, 1994), 424.</ref>\n\nIn 1394, Bayezid laid siege to [[Constantinople]],<ref>Mango, Cyril. ''The Oxford History of Byzantium''. 1st ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. p. 273-4</ref> the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Anadoluhisar\u0131]] fortress was built between 1393 and 1394 as part of preparations for the Second Ottoman Siege of Constantinople, which took place in 1395. On the urgings of the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaeologus]] a new [[crusade]] was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in 1396 the [[Christianity|Christian]] allies, under the leadership of the King of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (in 1433) [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], were defeated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. Bayezid built the magnificent [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] in Bursa, to celebrate this victory.\n\nThus the siege of Constantinople continued, lasting until 1402.<ref>Nancy Bisaha, ''Creating East And West: Renaissance Humanists And the Ottoman Turks'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 98.</ref> The beleaguered Byzantines had their reprieve when Bayezid fought the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid Empire]] in the East.<ref>Dimitris J. Kastritsis, ''The Sons of Bayezid: Empire Building and Representation in the Ottoman Civil War of 1402-13'', (Brill, 2007), 5.</ref> At this time, the empire of Bayezid included [[Thrace]] (except [[Constantinople]]), [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], and parts of [[Serbia]] in Europe. In Asia, his domains extended to the [[Taurus Mountains]]. His army was considered one of the best in the Islamic world.\n\n==Clash with Timur==\n\nIn 1397, Bayezid defeated the emir of Karaman in Ak\u00e7ay, killing him and annexing his territory. In 1398, the sultan conquered the Djanik emirate and the territory of Burhan al-Din, violating the accord with Timur. Finally, Bayezid occupied Elbistan and Malatya.\n\nIn 1400, the [[Turco-Mongol]] warlord [[Timur]] succeeded in rousing the local Turkic [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] who had been vassals of the Ottomans to join him in his attack on Bayezid, who was also considered one of the most powerful rulers in the Muslim world during that period. Years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Both rulers insulted each other in their own way while Timur preferred to undermine Bayezid's position as a ruler and play down the significance of his military successes. \n\nThis is the excerpt from one of Timur's letters addressed to Ottoman sultan:\n\n\"Believe me, you are but pismire ant: don't seek to fight the elephants for they'll crush you under their feet. Shall a petty prince such as you are contend with us? But your rodomontades (braggadocio) are not extraordinary; for a [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] never spake with judgement.

Many writers claim that Bayezid was mistreated by the Timurids. However, writers and historians from Timur's own court reported that Bayezid was treated well, and that Timur even mourned his death.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XDmZXIDiZG8C&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=timur+%22mourned%22+bayezid#v=onepage&q=timur%20%22mourned%22%20bayezid&f=false|title=Empires of Islam in Renaissance Historical Thought|last=MESERVE|first=Margaret|last2=Meserve|first2=Margaret|date=2009-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674040953|language=en}}</ref> One of Bayezid's sons, [[Mustafa \u00c7elebi]], was captured with him and held captive in [[Samarkand]] until 1405.\n\nFour of Bayezid's sons, specifically [[S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi]], [[\u0130sa \u00c7elebi]], [[Mehmed \u00c7elebi]], and [[Musa \u00c7elebi]], however, escaped from the battlefield and later started a civil war for the Ottoman throne known as the [[Ottoman Interregnum]].<ref>Dimitris J.

They embellished the legend that he was taken by Timur to [[Samarkand]] with a cast of characters to create an oriental fantasy that has maintained its appeal. [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'' was first performed in [[London]] in 1587, three years after the formal opening of English-Ottoman trade relations when [[William Harborne]] sailed for Constantinople as an agent of the [[Levant Company]].\n\nIn 1648, the play ''Le Gran Tamerlan et Bejezet'' by [[Jean Magnon]] appeared in London, and in 1725, [[Handel]]'s ''[[Tamerlano]]'' was first performed and published in London;<ref>London: Printed & sold by J. Cluer, [1725]</ref> [[Vivaldi]]'s version of the story, ''[[Bajazet (opera)|Bajazet]]'', was written in 1735. Magnon had given Bayezid an intriguing wife and daughter; the Handel and Vivaldi renditions included, as well as Tamerlane and Bayezid and his daughter, a prince of Byzantium and a princess of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] ([[Trabzon]]) in a passionate love story. A cycle of paintings in [[Schloss Eggenberg]], near [[Graz]] in [[Austria]], translated the theme to a different medium; this was completed in the 1670s shortly before the Ottoman army attacked the [[Habsburgs]] in central [[Europe]].<ref>Finkel, C.
