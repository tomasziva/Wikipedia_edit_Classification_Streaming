The late summer event in Black Rock City is an experiment in community and art, influenced by ten main principles: radical inclusion, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, gifting, [[decommodification]], participation, immediacy and [[leave no trace]]. The event takes its name from its culmination, the symbolic ritual burning of a large wooden effigy (\"The Man\") that traditionally occurs on the Saturday evening of the event.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/09/01/arts/20090902_BURNMAN_SLIDESHOW_index.html |title = Scenes From Burning Man |work = The New York Times |date = September 1, 2009 |access-date = 31 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name=dembowsky>{{cite news |last = Dembowky |first = April |title = Priming for Burning Man, Flames in Hand |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/arts/design/14burn.html |accessdate = August 6, 2011 |newspaper = The New York Times |date = August 13, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=chaplin>{{cite news |last = Chaplin |first = Julia |title = Burning Man spreads its flame |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/fashion/12Burners.html |accessdate = August 6, 2011 |newspaper = The New York Times |date = November 12, 2006 }}</ref><ref name=saillant>{{cite news |last = Saillant |first = Catherine |title = Burning Man becomes a hot academic topic |url = https://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/20/local/la-me-burning-man-20101020 |accessdate = August 6, 2011 |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |date = October 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{{Location map\n|USA West\n|relief     = 1\n|label      = <small>{{nowrap|Black Rock City}}</small>\n|lat        = 40.787\n|long       = -119.206\n|caption    = Location in the [[Western United States|western]] United States\n|marksize   = 5\n|lat_deg=|lon_deg=\n|float      =\n|background =\n|width      = 170\n}}\n\nFirst held {{Time ago|1986}} in 1986 on [[Baker Beach]] in San Francisco as a small function organized by [[Larry Harvey]] and Jerry James who built the first \"Man\", it has since been held annually, spanning the nine days leading up to and including [[Labor Day]] (the opening day is a Sunday, while the closing day is the first Monday in September).

He asked John Law, who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of [[Cacophony Society]], to take on central organizing functions. In the Cacophony Society's newsletter, it was announced as Zone No. 4, A Bad Day at Black Rock (inspired by the 1955 [[Bad Day at Black Rock|film of the same name]]).\n\nMeanwhile, the beach burn was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it, event organizers disassembled the effigy and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed and the pieces removed when the lot was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The effigy was reconstructed, led by Dan Miller, Harvey's then-housemate of many years, just in time to take it to Zone Trip No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/1986_1996/ |title = What is Burning Man?: Early Years |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMichael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, realized that a group unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would be helped by knowledgeable persons to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger, and created the Black Rock Rangers. Thus Black Rock City began as a fellowship, organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans' idea, along with Harvey and James' symbolic man. Drawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, John Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon at night.\n\nIn its first years, the community grew by word of mouth alone, all were considered participants by virtue of surviving in the desolate surreal trackless plain of the [[Black Rock Desert]]. There were no paid or scheduled performers or artists, no separation between art-space and living-space, no rules other than \"Don't interfere with anyone else's immediate experience\" and \"no guns in central camp.\"\n\n1991 marked the first year that the event had a legal permit, through the BLM (the [[Bureau of Land Management]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nv.blm.gov/news_releases/Press_Releases/fy06_releases/nr_wfo_33.htm |date = June 8, 2006 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060923001623/http://www.nv.blm.gov/news_releases/Press_Releases/fy06_releases/nr_wfo_33.htm |archive-date = September 23, 2006 |title = BURNING MAN RECEIVES FIVE-YEAR PERMIT |work = BLM News |publisher = United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management }}</ref> 1991 was also the year that art model and fire dancer (and later Burning Man's first art director) ''Crimson Rose'' attended the event.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.everfest.com/magazine/meet-the-woman-who-brought-fire-dancing-to-burning-man |title = Meet the Woman Who Brought Fire Dancing to Burning Man |work = Everfest |access-date = 9 March 2018 }}</ref> 1992 saw the birth of a smaller, intensive (about 20 participants the first year; about 100 in years two and three) near-by event named \"Desert Siteworks\", conceived and directed by William Binzen and co-produced (in 1993 and '94) with Judy West.<ref>({{cite book |last = Doherty |first = Brian |title = This Is Burning Man |publisher = [[Benbella Books]] |date = July 2006 |url = https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=799JDtofMpEC&lpg=PT54&ots=c6BpIxdDIB&dq=desert%20siteworks%20trego&pg=PT54#v=onepage&q=desert%20siteworks%20trego&f=false |accessdate = 13 June 2014 |isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0 }})</ref> The annual, several weeks-long event, was held over summer Solstice at various fertile hot springs surrounding the desert.

Harvey insisted that the death had not occurred at Burning Man, since the gates were not yet open. Another couple were run over in their tent by an art car driving to \"rave camp\", which was at that time distant from the main camp. After the 1996 event, co-founder and partner John Law [[John Law (American artist)#Founders' conflict|broke with Burning Man]] and publicly said the event should not continue.\n\n===1997 to present===\n[[File:Neonman2.jpg|thumb|upright|The neon-tubed Man at the 1999 event]]\n1997 marked another major pivotal year for the event. By 1996, the event had grown to 8,000 attendees and unrestricted driving on the open playa was becoming a major safety hazard. To implement a ban on driving and re-create the event as a pedestrian/bicycle/art-car-only event, it was decided to move to private gated property. Fly Ranch, with the smaller adjoining Hualapai dry lake-bed, just west of the Black Rock desert, was chosen. This moved Burning Man from Pershing County/federal BLM land into the jurisdiction of [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], which brought a protracted list of permit requirements.<ref>({{cite book |last = Doherty |first = Brian |title = This Is Burning Man |publisher = [[BenBella Books]] |date = July 2006 |page = 124 |isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0 }})</ref>\n\nTo comply with the new requirements and to manage the increased liability load, the organizers formed Black Rock City LLC, with the assistance of \"Biz Babe\" [[Dana Harrison]].

However, as the huge demand from the Main Sale left many veteran burners and theme camps without tickets, BMOrg opted for a \"directed ticket distribution\" instead, i.e., \"manually redirect them to some of the vital groups and collaborations that make up Black Rock City\" rather than an open sale.\n|-\n| 2013\n|{{convert|85|ft|abbr=on|}}\n| Black Rock Desert\n| 69,613<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blog.burningman.com/2013/09/news/black-rock-city-2013-population/ |title = Black Rock City 2013 Population |date = September 13, 2013 |accessdate = 21 August 2014 |website = Burning Man |publisher = [[Black Rock City, LLC]] }}</ref>\n| 68,000<ref>{{cite web |url = http://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/nepa/36777/43879/47225/Burning_Man_DNA_Attchs_2013_Stipulations.pdf |title = Burning Man 2013 Special Recreation Permit Stipulations |publisher = Bureau of Land Management |page = 1 |date = July 17, 2013 |accessdate = 6 August 2015 }}</ref>\n| $380\n| Cargo Cult<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2013 Art Theme: Cargo Cult {{!}} Burning Man|url = http://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/event-archives/2013-event-archive/bm13_theme/|website = burningman.org|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}</ref>\n|{{Ubl|Theme Camps: 1056|Placed Art: 382}}\n| The year's theme was based on [[John Frum]] and [[Cargo Cult]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/art_of_burningman/bm13_theme.html |title = 2013 Art Theme: Cargo Cult |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 30 November 2012 }}</ref> Ticket tiers were eliminated and a flat rate price structure was adopted (except for low-income ticket program).<ref>{{cite web |last = Chase |first = Will |title = Burning Man 2013 Ticket Sales |url = http://blog.burningman.com/2013/01/news/burning-man-2013-ticket-sales/ |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = January 5, 2013 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 2014\n| {{convert|105|ft|abbr=on}}\n| Black Rock Desert\n| 65,922<ref name=\"her\">{{cite web |url = https://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/event-archives/2014-event-archive/ |title = 2014 AfterBurn Report |accessdate = 10 September 2017 |website = Burning Man |publisher = [[Black Rock City, LLC]] }}</ref>\n| 68,000<ref name=\"SRP 2014\">\"The population cap does not include volunteers, government personnel, emergency service providers, vendors and contractors.\"{{cite web |url = https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/nepa/39776/49115/53424/CD_Signed_BRC_2014_Stips_%281%29.pdf |title = Burning Man 2014 Special Recreation Permit Stipulations |publisher = Bureau of Land Management |page = 1 |date = July 31, 2014 |accessdate = 6 August 2015 }}</ref>\n| {{ubl\n| $380\n| Vehicle pass: $40\n}}\n| Caravansary<ref>{{cite web |title = 2014 Art Theme: Caravansary |url = http://www.burningman.com/art_of_burningman/bm14_theme.html |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = January 9, 2014 }}</ref>\n|{{Ubl|Theme Camps:|Placed Art: 350}}\n| This year, the Burning Man Traffic Mitigation Plan went into effect.

They were originally written by Larry Harvey in 2004<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKu1vS1_lHw |title = Larry Harvey Talk Burning Man 2010 Regional Summit |via = YouTube |accessdate = 22 June 2012 }}</ref> as guidelines for regional organizing, then later became a universal criterion of the general culture of the multifaceted movement. They are:<ref name=principles>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html |title = 10 principles of Burning Man |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* radical [[inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]]\n* gifting\n* [[decommodification]]\n* radical [[self-sufficiency|self-reliance]]\n* radical [[emotional expression|self-expression]]\n* [[community|communal]] effort\n* civic [[:wikt:responsibility|responsibility]]\n* [[leave no trace|leaving no trace]]\n* participation\n* immediacy\nThe descriptions in quotes are the actual text:\n\n===Radical Inclusion===\n\n\"Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.\"\nThis was written with a broad stroke for general organizing, meaning anyone is welcome to the Burning Man culture. Prerequisites for the Burning Man<ref name=principles /> event are; participants are expected to provide for their own basic needs, follow the guidelines stated in the annually updated event \"survival guide\", and purchase a ticket to get in.<ref name=survivalguide>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/index.html |title = 10 Burning Man Survival Guide |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Gifting===\n\"Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.\"\nInstead of cash, participants at the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert are encouraged to rely on a [[gift economy]], a sort of [[potlatch]]. In the earliest days of the event, an underground [[barter]] economy also existed, in which burners exchanged \"favors\" with each other. While this was originally supported by the Burning Man organization, this is now largely discouraged. Instead, burners are encouraged to give gifts to one another unconditionally.\n\n===Decommodification===\n\"In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.\"\nNo cash transactions are permitted between attendees of the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert. Cash can be used for a select few charity, fuel, and sanitation vendors as follows:\n<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/community.html |title = No Cash Transactions |publisher = Burning Man |date = August 29, 2011 |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* Caf\u00e9 beverages such as coffee, [[Masala chai|chai]], [[lemonade]], etc., which are sold at Center Camp Caf\u00e9, operated by the organizers of the event.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/participate/cafe_coffee_shop.html |title = Coffee |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Ice]] sales benefit the local [[Gerlach, Nevada|Gerlach]]-[[Empire, Nevada|Empire]] school system.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/infrastructure/ice.html |title = Camp Arctica |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* Tickets for the shuttle bus to the nearest Nevada communities of Gerlach and Empire which is operated by a contractor not participating in the event: [[Green Tortoise]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/community.html |title = Shuttle Service |publisher = Burning Man |date = August 29, 2011 |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* A re-entry wristband, which allows a person to leave and re-enter the event and may be purchased at the gate upon exit.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/faq_what_is.html#Tickets |title = What is Burning Man?: FAQ |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* An airport use fee, payable at the airport upon first entry.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/faq_air.html |title = On The Playa |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120141639/http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/faq_air.html |archivedate = January 20, 2012 |df = }}</ref>\n* Diesel and biodiesel sold by third-party contractors.\n* RV dump service and camp [[graywater]] disposal service.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/rvs.html |title = Preparation |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* Private portable toilets and servicing, which can be arranged with the official contractor.\n\n===Radical Self-Reliance===\n[[File:Burning Man 2012 (7942014474).jpg|thumb|Dust storms are common at Burning Man, so many come prepared with appropriate provisions, such as goggles and masks to reduce dust inhalation.]]\n\"Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.\"\nThe event's harsh environment and remote location requires participants to be responsible for their own subsistence.

We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.\"\n\n===Participation===\n\n\"Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.\" People are encouraged to participate, rather than observe.\n\n===Immediacy===\n\"Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.\"\n\n== The Temple ==\n[[File:Temple Of Joy Burning Man 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2002 Temple Of Joy]]\n[[File:Temple Burn - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2004 Temple Of Stars]]\n[[File:The Tempel.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2009 \"Fire of Fires\" Temple]]\n[[File:Temple on Fire (6199221199).jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2011 Temple Of Transition]]\n[[File:Burning Man 2012 (7941972948).jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2012 Temple Of Juno]]\n[[File:Burning Man 2014- Caravansary (14953605920).jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2014 Temple Of Grace]]\n[[File:Burning Man Art 2015 (21067016923).jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2015 Temple of Promise]]\n[[File:Burning Man 2016 Daytime 188 (29713384084).jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|2016 Temple (with No Name)]]\nThe burning of a temple, as well as the Man, has become a traditional activity at the event.

They keep the space, as well as the participants who visit it, safe.\n\nIn 2002 David Best and Termeh Yeghiazarian brainstormed on how to prevent potential damage and arson to the Temple, as well as prevent injury to those experiencing the Temple. They came up with the idea of volunteer Guardian Angels, who would inconspicuously monitor the Temple during daylight hours, gently redirecting unsafe behavior and actions that disrupted the sacred atmosphere of the Temple. It was the birth of the Temple Guardians.\n\nPresently, over 400 individuals volunteer as Guardians throughout the event. A dozen Guardians monitor the Temple during each shift, 24 hours a day every day that the Temple is open. Even before the gates open, Guardians stand watch along the Temple perimeter while the Temple Crew completes the build, and will do so again after the Temple has closed on Sunday morning for pre-burn preparations for that night\u2019s penultimate event of Burning Man, the Temple burn. A select group of specially trained Guardians will carry offerings from Burners to the Temple, often in memory of those they have lost. The offerings are carefully placed in visible spot and burned with the rest of the memorials for that burn.\n\n==Art==\n\nBurning Man primarily features large scale interactive installation art inspired by the intersection of [[maker culture]], technology and a connection to nature. Many works invite participation through climbing, touch, a technological interface or motion. Because of its principles of participation and radical inclusivity, much of outsider and [[visionary art]], though a great variety of art forms appear during the event. Creative expression through the arts and interactive art are encouraged at Burning Man in many forms. Music, performance and guerrilla street theatre are art forms commonly presented within the camps and developed areas of the city. Artwork is placed in the open playa beyond the streets of the city and each year hundreds of isolated artworks, ranging from small to very large-scale art installations, often sculptures with kinetic, electronic and fire elements are brought to Black Rock City.\n\nArt on the dry lake bed (the ''playa'') is assisted by the Artery, which helps artists place their art in the desert and ensures lighting (to prevent collisions), burn platform (to protect the integrity of the dry lake bed) and that fire safety requirements are met.<ref>Burningman.com [http://www.burningman.com/installations/ Art Installations]</ref> [[Art grant]]s are, however, available to participants via a system of curation and oversight, with application deadlines early in the year. Grants are intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means, and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces, usually requiring considerable reliance on an artist's community resources. Aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions (usually well over 100) but amounts to several percent (on the order of $500,000 in recent years) of the gross receipts from ticket sales. In 2006, 29 pieces were funded.\n\nVarious standards regarding the nature of the artworks eligible for grants are set by the Art Department, but compliance with the theme and interactivity are important considerations. This funding has fostered artistic communities, most notably in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area of California]], the region that has historically provided a majority of the event's participants. There are active and successful outreach efforts to enlarge the regional scope of the event and the grant program.\n\n=== ''No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man'' ===\nIn 2018, the Renwick Gallery of the American Art Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. brought the large-scale, participatory work from the desert gathering to the nation's capital for the first time.<ref name=\"americanart.si.edu\">{{Cite web |url = https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/burning-man |title = No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man |website = Smithsonian American Art Museum |access-date = 21 March 2018 }}</ref> The exhibition took over the entire Renwick Gallery building and surrounding neighborhood, bringing alive the maker culture and creative spirit of this cultural movement. Immersive room-sized installations, costumes, jewelry, and ephemera transport visitors to the gathering's famed \"Playa\", while photographs and archival materials from the [[Nevada Museum of Art]] trace Burning Man's growth and its bohemian roots.<ref name=\"americanart.si.edu\"/>\n\nLarge-scale installations\u2014the artistic hallmark of Burning Man\u2014form the core of the exhibition. Individual artists and collectives featured in ''No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man'' include [[David Best (sculptor)|David Best]], [[Candy Chang]], [[Marco Cochrane]], [[Duane Flatmo]], Michael Garlington and Natalia Bertotti, Five Ton Crane Arts Collective, [https://www.foldhaus.com/ FoldHaus Art Collective], Scott Froschauer, HYBYCOZO, (Yelena Filipchuk and Serge Beaulieu), Android Jones, Aaron Taylor Kuffner, Christopher Schardt, Richard Wilks, and [[Leo Villareal]].\n\nIn addition, multiple large-scale public Burning Man art installations were exhibited throughout the neighborhood surrounding the museum, for an extension of the show ''No Spectators: Beyond the Renwick,'' which included works by Jack Champion, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, HYBYCOZO, Laura Kimpton, Kate Raudenbush, and Mischell Riley. All outdoor works had been installed as honorarium artwork at Burning Man in years past, except for the artwork by Hybycozo. This outdoor exhibition was co-produced by a first ever collaboration with the Golden Triangle BID (Business Improvement District in Washington DC), curated by Karyn Miller.\n\n==Mutant vehicles==\n[[File:Burning man 2010 (4966356687).jpg|thumb|Praying Mantis truck (2010)]]\n\nMutant Vehicles are purpose-built or creatively altered motorized vehicles.  They are a subset of a type of vehicle known as an \"Art Car\", which refers to any standard vehicle that has been artistically modified.  The term \"Mutant Vehicle\" was coined by Organizers of the Burning Man event to delineate a type of \"Art Car\" that was more dramatically modified than simply decorating an existing vehicle.\n\nBurning Man participants who wish to bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the event's own DMV or \"Department of Mutant Vehicles\"<ref>https://burningman.org/event/black-rock-city-guide/infrastructure/dept-of-mutant-vehicles/</ref> for consideration.  If a vehicle design meets the \"Mutant Vehicle Criteria,<ref>https://burningman.org/event/art-performance/mutant-vehicles/mv-criteria-and-licensing/</ref> the vehicle is invited to the event for a final physical inspection and licensing at the the event. Not all designs and proposals are accepted. The event organizers, and in turn the DMV, have set the bar high for what it deems an acceptable MV each year, in effect capping the number of Mutant Vehicles. This is in response to constraints imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which grants permits to hold the event on federal property, and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment. Vehicles that are minimally altered, and/or whose primary function is to transport participants, are discouraged and not invited. One of the criteria the DMV employs to determine whether an application for a proposed Mutant Vehicle is approved is \"can you recognize the base vehicle\". For example, if a 1967 VW van covered with glitter, dolls' heads, and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a VW van, the DMV would consider it an \"Art Car\", but it would not be sufficiently altered to meet the Mutant Vehicle Criteria.\n\nThere were over six hundred approved Mutant Vehicles at the event in 2019<ref>https://www.motortrend.com/news/art-cars-mutant-vehicles-burning-man-2019/</ref>\n\n==Bicycles==\n[[File:BURNING MAN 2010 (4962240955).jpg|thumb|Cyclists at Burning Man (2010)]]\nBicycles and tricycles are popular for getting around on the dry lake. [[Mountain bikes]] are generally preferred over [[road bike]]s for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using [[electroluminescent wire]] (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over the frame of the bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of people on their bikes and art cars, illuminated sculptures and stages create a unique visual effect.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.viberate.com/article/how-much-will-burning-man-cost-you-plus-the-ultimate-black-rock-city-survival-guide/ |title = How much will Burning Man Cost You?

Terbo Ted was identified as having been the first ever DJ in Burning Man history, opening with a [[Jean Michel Jarre]] song played off a [[vinyl record]]. DJs typically occupied an area on the outskirts of the Playa nicknamed the \"Techno Ghetto\". In later years, designated spokes of the main camp were designated for \"sound camps\", with limits on volume and speaker positioning (angled away from the center of Black Rock City). To work around the rules, mutant vehicles with live DJs and large sound systems began to appear as well. A number of major electronic music camps have been well-known recurrents at Burning Man, including Opulent Temple and Robot Heart. Major producers and DJs representing various eras and genres have performed at Burning Man, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Markus Schulz]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian]] and [[Freq Nasty]] among others.<ref name=\"npr-burningmanedm\">{{cite web |title = Desert Music: Burning Man Confronts The Rising Beat |url = https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/09/02/436697747/desert-music-burning-man-confronts-the-rising-beat |publisher = NPR |accessdate = September 3, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |url = https://djmag.com/news/band-hooligans-vandalise-paul-oakenfolds-burning-man-camp |title = &quot;BAND OF HOOLIGANS&quot; VANDALISE PAUL OAKENFOLD&#039;S BURNING MAN CAMP |date = 2016-09-05 |website = DJMag.com |access-date = 2019-11-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, concerns began to surface among attendees that a growing number of \"mainstream\" [[electronic dance music]] acts (such as [[Skrillex]] and [[Diplo]]'s [[Jack \u00dc]] in 2014) had begun to appear.

Much of the layout and general city infrastructure is constructed by Department of Public Works (DPW) volunteers who often reside in Black Rock City for several weeks before and after the event.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/infrastructure/dpw.html |title = On The Playa |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/ |title = On The Playa |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref> The remainder of the city including theme camps, villages, art installations and individual camping are all created by participants.\n\n===City planning===\nThe developed part of the city is currently arranged as a series of concentric streets in an arc composing, since 1999, two-thirds of a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) diameter circle with the Man Sculpture and his supporting complex at the very center ({{CoordDec|40.786455|-119.206701}} in 2017). Radial streets, sometimes called Avenues, extend from the Man to the outermost circle. The outlines of these streets are visible on aerial photographs.[[File:Burning Man aerial.jpg|thumb|Oblique aerial photo of Black Rock City showing the familiar \"C\" pattern 2010]]The innermost street is named the ''Esplanade'', and the remaining streets are given names to coincide with the overall theme of the burn, and ordered in ways such as alphabetical order or stem to stern, to make them easier to recall. For example, in 1999, for the \"Wheel of Time\" theme, and again in 2004 for \"The Vault of Heaven\" theme, the streets were named after the planets of the solar system. The radial streets are usually given a clock designation, for example, 6:00 or 6:15, in which the Man is at the center of the clock face and 12:00 is in the middle of the third of the arc lacking streets (usually at a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of 60\u00b0 true from the Man). These avenues have been identified in other ways, notably in 2002, in accordance with \"The Floating World\" theme, as the degrees of a compass, for example 175 degrees, and in 2003 as part of the Beyond Belief theme as adjectives (\"Rational, Absurd\") that caused every intersection with a concentric street (named after concepts of belief such as \"Authority, Creed\") to form a phrase such as \"Absurd Authority\" or \"Rational Creed\". However, these proved unpopular with participants due to difficulty in navigating the city without the familiar clock layout.\n\nThe Black Rock City Airport is constructed adjacent to the city, typically on its southern side. See Transportation section below.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/ |title = Black Rock City Airport |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Center Camp===\n[[File:Burning Man 2013 Cargo Cult (9625733758) (3).jpg|thumb|Bureau of Land Management officers and a Ranger at Burning Man]]\nCenter Camp is located along the midline of Black Rock City, facing the Man at the 6:00 position on the Esplanade. This area serves as a central meeting place for the entire city and contains the Center Camp Cafe, Camp Arctica and a number of other city institutions.\n\n===Villages and theme camps===\nVillages and theme camps are located along the innermost streets of Black Rock City, often offering entertainment or services to participants.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/31/BAGD0EFM9G1.DTL |title = Theme Camps |work = San Francisco Chronicle |date = August 31, 2005 |accessdate = 31 March 2012 |first = Meredith |last = May }}</ref>\n\nTheme camps are usually a collective of people representing themselves under a single identity. Villages are usually a collection of smaller theme camps which have banded together in order to share resources and vie for better placement.\n\nTheme camps and villages often form to create an atmosphere in Black Rock City that their group envisioned. As Burning Man grows every year it attracts an even more diverse crowd. Subcultures form around theme camps at Black Rock City similar to what can be found in other cities.\n\n===Volunteers===\nThe Burning Man event is heavily dependent on a large number of volunteers.<ref>Burningman.com [http://www.burningman.com/participate/volunteer.html Volunteering page]</ref>\n\n===Safety, policing and regulations===\nBlack Rock City is patrolled by various local and state [[police|law enforcement]] agencies as well as the [[Bureau of Land Management Rangers]]. The local police issue $1,500 fines for drug use and serving alcohol to minors. Burning Man also has its own in-house group of volunteers, the Black Rock Rangers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangers.burningman.com/about/ |title=Who are the Rangers? {{!}} Black Rock Rangers |website=rangers.burningman.com |access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> who act as informal mediators when disputes arise between participants.\n\n[[Firefighting]], [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical services (EMS)]], mental health, and communications support is provided by the volunteer Black Rock City Emergency Services Department (ESD). Three \"[[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital|MASH]]\"-like stations are set up in the city: station 3, 6 and 9. Station 6 is staffed by physicians and nurses working with a contracted state licensed ALS Medical provider, while Stations 3 and 9 are staffed by Black Rock City ESD personnel. While Station 3 and 9 provide emergency services and basic life support, the volunteers are generally doctors, nurses, [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]]/[[paramedics]], and firefighters. Both station 3 and 9 have a small fire engines available in addition to a Hazardous material/ Rescue truck and [[quick response vehicle]] for medical emergencies.\n\nIn [[:File:FBI files on Burning Man.pdf|documents]] from February 2013 first made public on August 29, 2015, it was revealed that in August 2010, the [[FBI]] had sent a memo to its field offices in Nevada stating that it would patrol Burning Man to \"aid in the prevention of terrorist activities and intelligence collection\". Although a threat assessment performed by the FBI in consort with Burning Man's contracted security determined that drug usage and crowd control were the only major threats to Burning Man, the Bureau still sent an unspecified number of undercover officers to the event, with \"no adverse threats or reactions\".<ref>{{cite web |title = FBI admits to spying on Burning Man |url = http://www.rt.com/usa/314303-burning-man-fbi-spying/ |publisher = RT |accessdate = September 12, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Black Rock City design evolution ==\n\n=== 1986\u20131991 ===\nFrom the very beginning on Baker Beach, to 1991 when Burning Man was set into its desert home, there was no real organizational structure to the city.

This was not particularly planned, but formed instinctively from the traditional campfire circle and the urge to 'circle the wagons' against the nearly boundless space.\" This would not work for much longer, as attendance was reaching into the hundreds, and such a large gathering would require some planning.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |url = http://burningman.org/timeline/#!/1986 |title = Timeline \u2013 Burning Man }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://journal.burningman.org/2010/04/black-rock-city/building-brc/designing-black-rock-city/ |title = Designing Black Rock City |work = Burning Man Journal |access-date = 10 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1992\u20131995 ===\nThe [[Bureau of Land Management]] took notice of the event, and required that plans be drawn up to maintain safety. They also required the Burn to be registered as an official event. In response, four [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] roads were added emanating from center camp. The Man was located {{Convert|100|yd|m}} West of Center camp, due to the camp being oriented with the path of the sun across the sky, as opposed to North-to-South. The center circle from the birth of the event was maintained.\n\nIn 1993, the first sound camp was opened. It was known as the Techno Ghetto, and it was located 2 miles north of Center Camp. It was not a usual theme camp, but was instead a mini hub on its own; There was a small \"center camp\" with a message board and [[Portable toilet|Port-a-potties]]. The center was surrounded by a circle of camping area {{Convert|1200|ft|m}} across. Six massive sound systems faced out from the circle.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/9avb9a/death-and-ecstasy-the-rise-and-fall-of-burning-mans-original-rave-ghetto |title = Death and Ecstasy: The Rise and Fall of Burning Man's Original Rave Ghetto |date = August 31, 2015 |work = Thump |access-date = 14 July 2018 }}</ref> The Techno Ghetto was placed separately to keep the 'rave' out of the main event, yet as time has progressed, music has become more and more closely tied into the core culture of Burning man, even spawning a unique genre known as Playa Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.burn.life/blog/interview-with-the-founder-of-the-first-sound-camp-at-burning-man |title = Interview with the founder of Burning Man's first sound camp |website = Life |access-date = 14 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1996 ===\nWith the population growing to 8,000 in 1996, more structure was essential to both appease the Bureau of Land Management, and to maintain safety. A ring around Center Camp, aptly named Ring Road, was added to provide for a second circle of theme camps. In addition, the eastern section of the circle around Center camp in a cone shape was declared a \"No Man's Land\", devoid of all art installations and campsites. The goal was to provide a picturesque view from Center Camp of The Man in the distance. In addition to the camps circling the Center, there were also camps lining the outside of the No Man's Land cone.\n\nThe techno ghetto would remain for one last year in 1996, and it wouldn't return. Regardless, the spark of music had ignited, and many other sound camps would follow.\n\n=== 1997 ===\nIn 1997 Burning Man was relocated. The event moved off of the [[Black Rock Desert|Playa]] to the [[Hualapai Flat]], due to political problems with [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]. Black Rock City truly became a city in 1997, with formal, labeled streets, zoning, and registration for vehicles and theme camps. Rod Garret was brought on board as the lead designer of Black Rock City from then on.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.burn.life/1997-2000-maturation.html |title = Burning Man 1997\u20132000 |website = Life |access-date = 14 July 2018 }}</ref> In his design, Center Camp remained the starting point, with two angular arms reaching out on either side to form a shallow \"V\" shape around the Man. These main arms consisted of six annular roads, and two outlying plazas. 1997 is the first year of a Ranger-patrolled perimeter, and also the first year of one entry gate.\n\n=== 1998 ===\nBurning Man returned to the playa in 1998, and the basis of the modern layout was implemented. The idea was to \"recreate some of the intimacy of our original camping circle, but on a much larger civic scale.\" Rod Garret's design smoothed out the angular \"V\" from 1997 and implemented the arc, although in 1998, it stretched less than half-way around the circle. The radial streets were numbered North 1\u201320 and South 1\u201320, instead of the modern clock face system of names such as 11:30 or 5:15. There were four large plazas, each occupied by a major theme camp.\n\n=== 1999\u20132010 ===\nIn 1999, for the '''Wheel of Time''' theme, the great arc of the city was expanded to the full 240\u00b0 (\u2154 of a circle) that it is today. The streets were re-numbered to correspond to a [[clock face]], with the Man in the center, Center Camp at 6:00, and streets every 30 minutes (15\u00b0) 2:00 through 10:00.\n\n2000 saw the introduction of the Temple as a fixture on the playa, and it has grown to be easily as important as the Man. It was placed at 12:00 out in the deep playa in the open third of the circle. 2000 also marked the year that the concept of a loud side and a quiet side was replaced by the rule that large scale sound camps would be placed at the 10:00 and 2:00 edges, facing out into the deep playa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/afterburn/06-2/history/|title=History {{!}} Burning Man|website=burningman.org|access-date=14 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nExtra annular streets have been added as need has increased.\n\n=== 2011\u2013present ===\nIn 2011, extra radial streets were added from G street out to make outer-city navigation easier.

When it was finally determined that they did not dissipate with the annual winter rains and flooding, in 2000, the organization declared that fires had to be elevated from the playa surface for its protection. When it was discovered by two of the founders of the Friends of Black Rock / High Rock (Garth Elliott & Sue Weeks) and BLM Winnemucca district director Terry Reid that Burn scars from prior sites (numbering 250) still remained, they were finally eradicated in 2000 by the DPW clean up crew headed by Dan Miller.\n\nOn the last day of the event, public shared burn areas are prepared for participants to use.

In the Cacophony Society's newsletter, it was announced as Zone No. 4, A Bad Day at Black Rock (inspired by the 1955 [[Bad Day at Black Rock|film of the same name]]).\n\nMeanwhile, the beach burn was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it, event organizers disassembled the effigy and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed and the pieces removed when the lot was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The effigy was reconstructed, led by Dan Miller, Harvey's then-housemate of many years, just in time to take it to Zone Trip No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/1986_1996/ |title = What is Burning Man?: Early Years |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMichael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, realized that a group unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would be helped by knowledgeable persons to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger, and created the Black Rock Rangers. Thus Black Rock City began as a fellowship, organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans' idea, along with Harvey and James' symbolic man. Drawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, John Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon at night.\n\nIn its first years, the community grew by word of mouth alone, all were considered participants by virtue of surviving in the desolate surreal trackless plain of the [[Black Rock Desert]]. There were no paid or scheduled performers or artists, no separation between art-space and living-space, no rules other than \"Don't interfere with anyone else's immediate experience\" and \"no guns in central camp.\"\n\n1991 marked the first year that the event had a legal permit, through the BLM (the [[Bureau of Land Management]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nv.blm.gov/news_releases/Press_Releases/fy06_releases/nr_wfo_33.htm |date = June 8, 2006 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060923001623/http://www.nv.blm.gov/news_releases/Press_Releases/fy06_releases/nr_wfo_33.htm |archive-date = September 23, 2006 |title = BURNING MAN RECEIVES FIVE-YEAR PERMIT |work = BLM News |publisher = United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management }}</ref> 1991 was also the year that art model and fire dancer (and later Burning Man's first art director) ''Crimson Rose'' attended the event.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.everfest.com/magazine/meet-the-woman-who-brought-fire-dancing-to-burning-man |title = Meet the Woman Who Brought Fire Dancing to Burning Man |work = Everfest |access-date = 9 March 2018 }}</ref> 1992 saw the birth of a smaller, intensive (about 20 participants the first year; about 100 in years two and three) near-by event named \"Desert Siteworks\", conceived and directed by William Binzen and co-produced (in 1993 and '94) with Judy West.<ref>({{cite book |last = Doherty |first = Brian |title = This Is Burning Man |publisher = [[Benbella Books]] |date = July 2006 |url = https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=799JDtofMpEC&lpg=PT54&ots=c6BpIxdDIB&dq=desert%20siteworks%20trego&pg=PT54#v=onepage&q=desert%20siteworks%20trego&f=false |accessdate = 13 June 2014 |isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0 }})</ref> The annual, several weeks-long event, was held over summer Solstice at various fertile hot springs surrounding the desert. Participants built art and participated in self-directed performances.

After the 1996 event, co-founder and partner John Law [[John Law (American artist)#Founders' conflict|broke with Burning Man]] and publicly said the event should not continue.\n\n===1997 to present===\n[[File:Neonman2.jpg|thumb|upright|The neon-tubed Man at the 1999 event]]\n1997 marked another major pivotal year for the event. By 1996, the event had grown to 8,000 attendees and unrestricted driving on the open playa was becoming a major safety hazard. To implement a ban on driving and re-create the event as a pedestrian/bicycle/art-car-only event, it was decided to move to private gated property. Fly Ranch, with the smaller adjoining Hualapai dry lake-bed, just west of the Black Rock desert, was chosen. This moved Burning Man from Pershing County/federal BLM land into the jurisdiction of [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], which brought a protracted list of permit requirements.<ref>({{cite book |last = Doherty |first = Brian |title = This Is Burning Man |publisher = [[BenBella Books]] |date = July 2006 |page = 124 |isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0 }})</ref>\n\nTo comply with the new requirements and to manage the increased liability load, the organizers formed Black Rock City LLC, with the assistance of \"Biz Babe\" [[Dana Harrison]].

At one point it looked like all of the board members were going to hire lawyers. Corporate appraisers were brought in to determine how much the company was worth, which Larry Harvey found \"abhorrent\" and against all of the values that Burning Man stood for.<ref>{{cite news |title = Man on the move |url = http://www.sfbg.com/2011/04/05/man-move }}</ref>\n\nAn earlier agreement stated that each member of the LLC would only receive \"sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000.\" But the members now consented to an arrangement whereby each member of the LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communications, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement: \"When you're in the middle of a storm, if you're going to explain all of how you got there, and how you're going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness.\"<ref>{{cite news |title = The Changing Face of the Burning Man Festival |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/business/growing-pains-for-burning-man-festival.html?pagewanted=3&_r=3&emc=eta1 |work = The New York Times |first = Jessica |last = Bruder |date = August 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIt was announced in March 2014 via the official Burning Man Blog that the non-profit transition was complete.<ref>{{cite web |title = Burning Man Transitions to Non-Profit Organization |url = http://blog.burningman.com/2014/03/news/burning-man-transitions-to-non-profit-organization/ |website = Burning Blog |accessdate = August 25, 2014 }}</ref> Under the new non-profit structure, Black Rock City LLC would be a subsidiary of the non-profit Burning Man Project.

On January 27, BMOrg announced that the number of tickets requested in the Main Sale was around 120,000 vs the 40,000 that were available. In consequence a significant number of registrants would not be awarded tickets in the Main Sale. The Main Sale was originally planned to be followed by a secondary open sale of 10,000 tickets. However, as the huge demand from the Main Sale left many veteran burners and theme camps without tickets, BMOrg opted for a \"directed ticket distribution\" instead, i.e., \"manually redirect them to some of the vital groups and collaborations that make up Black Rock City\" rather than an open sale.\n|-\n| 2013\n|{{convert|85|ft|abbr=on|}}\n| Black Rock Desert\n| 69,613<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blog.burningman.com/2013/09/news/black-rock-city-2013-population/ |title = Black Rock City 2013 Population |date = September 13, 2013 |accessdate = 21 August 2014 |website = Burning Man |publisher = [[Black Rock City, LLC]] }}</ref>\n| 68,000<ref>{{cite web |url = http://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/nepa/36777/43879/47225/Burning_Man_DNA_Attchs_2013_Stipulations.pdf |title = Burning Man 2013 Special Recreation Permit Stipulations |publisher = Bureau of Land Management |page = 1 |date = July 17, 2013 |accessdate = 6 August 2015 }}</ref>\n| $380\n| Cargo Cult<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2013 Art Theme: Cargo Cult {{!}} Burning Man|url = http://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/event-archives/2013-event-archive/bm13_theme/|website = burningman.org|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}</ref>\n|{{Ubl|Theme Camps: 1056|Placed Art: 382}}\n| The year's theme was based on [[John Frum]] and [[Cargo Cult]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/art_of_burningman/bm13_theme.html |title = 2013 Art Theme: Cargo Cult |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 30 November 2012 }}</ref> Ticket tiers were eliminated and a flat rate price structure was adopted (except for low-income ticket program).<ref>{{cite web |last = Chase |first = Will |title = Burning Man 2013 Ticket Sales |url = http://blog.burningman.com/2013/01/news/burning-man-2013-ticket-sales/ |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = January 5, 2013 }}</ref>\n|-\n| 2014\n| {{convert|105|ft|abbr=on}}\n| Black Rock Desert\n| 65,922<ref name=\"her\">{{cite web |url = https://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/event-archives/2014-event-archive/ |title = 2014 AfterBurn Report |accessdate = 10 September 2017 |website = Burning Man |publisher = [[Black Rock City, LLC]] }}</ref>\n| 68,000<ref name=\"SRP 2014\">\"The population cap does not include volunteers, government personnel, emergency service providers, vendors and contractors.\"{{cite web |url = https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/nepa/39776/49115/53424/CD_Signed_BRC_2014_Stips_%281%29.pdf |title = Burning Man 2014 Special Recreation Permit Stipulations |publisher = Bureau of Land Management |page = 1 |date = July 31, 2014 |accessdate = 6 August 2015 }}</ref>\n| {{ubl\n| $380\n| Vehicle pass: $40\n}}\n| Caravansary<ref>{{cite web |title = 2014 Art Theme: Caravansary |url = http://www.burningman.com/art_of_burningman/bm14_theme.html |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = January 9, 2014 }}</ref>\n|{{Ubl|Theme Camps:|Placed Art: 350}}\n| This year, the Burning Man Traffic Mitigation Plan went into effect.

They were originally written by Larry Harvey in 2004<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKu1vS1_lHw |title = Larry Harvey Talk Burning Man 2010 Regional Summit |via = YouTube |accessdate = 22 June 2012 }}</ref> as guidelines for regional organizing, then later became a universal criterion of the general culture of the multifaceted movement. They are:<ref name=principles>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html |title = 10 principles of Burning Man |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n* radical [[inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]]\n* gifting\n* [[decommodification]]\n* radical [[self-sufficiency|self-reliance]]\n* radical [[emotional expression|self-expression]]\n* [[community|communal]] effort\n* civic [[:wikt:responsibility|responsibility]]\n* [[leave no trace|leaving no trace]]\n* participation\n* immediacy\nThe descriptions in quotes are the actual text:\n\n===Radical Inclusion===\n\n\"Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.\"\nThis was written with a broad stroke for general organizing, meaning anyone is welcome to the Burning Man culture. Prerequisites for the Burning Man<ref name=principles /> event are; participants are expected to provide for their own basic needs, follow the guidelines stated in the annually updated event \"survival guide\", and purchase a ticket to get in.<ref name=survivalguide>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/index.html |title = 10 Burning Man Survival Guide |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Gifting===\n\"Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.\"\nInstead of cash, participants at the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert are encouraged to rely on a [[gift economy]], a sort of [[potlatch]]. In the earliest days of the event, an underground [[barter]] economy also existed, in which burners exchanged \"favors\" with each other. While this was originally supported by the Burning Man organization, this is now largely discouraged. Instead, burners are encouraged to give gifts to one another unconditionally.\n\n===Decommodification===\n\"In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.\"\nNo cash transactions are permitted between attendees of the Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert.

They keep the space, as well as the participants who visit it, safe.\n\nIn 2002 David Best and Termeh Yeghiazarian brainstormed on how to prevent potential damage and arson to the Temple, as well as prevent injury to those experiencing the Temple. They came up with the idea of volunteer Guardian Angels, who would inconspicuously monitor the Temple during daylight hours, gently redirecting unsafe behavior and actions that disrupted the sacred atmosphere of the Temple. It was the birth of the Temple Guardians.\n\nPresently, over 400 individuals volunteer as Guardians throughout the event. A dozen Guardians monitor the Temple during each shift, 24 hours a day every day that the Temple is open. Even before the gates open, Guardians stand watch along the Temple perimeter while the Temple Crew completes the build, and will do so again after the Temple has closed on Sunday morning for pre-burn preparations for that night\u2019s penultimate event of Burning Man, the Temple burn. A select group of specially trained Guardians will carry offerings from Burners to the Temple, often in memory of those they have lost. The offerings are carefully placed in visible spot and burned with the rest of the memorials for that burn.\n\n==Art==\n\nBurning Man primarily features large scale interactive installation art inspired by the intersection of [[maker culture]], technology and a connection to nature. Many works invite participation through climbing, touch, a technological interface or motion. Because of its principles of participation and radical inclusivity, much of outsider and [[visionary art]], though a great variety of art forms appear during the event. Creative expression through the arts and interactive art are encouraged at Burning Man in many forms. Music, performance and guerrilla street theatre are art forms commonly presented within the camps and developed areas of the city. Artwork is placed in the open playa beyond the streets of the city and each year hundreds of isolated artworks, ranging from small to very large-scale art installations, often sculptures with kinetic, electronic and fire elements are brought to Black Rock City.\n\nArt on the dry lake bed (the ''playa'') is assisted by the Artery, which helps artists place their art in the desert and ensures lighting (to prevent collisions), burn platform (to protect the integrity of the dry lake bed) and that fire safety requirements are met.<ref>Burningman.com [http://www.burningman.com/installations/ Art Installations]</ref> [[Art grant]]s are, however, available to participants via a system of curation and oversight, with application deadlines early in the year. Grants are intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means, and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces, usually requiring considerable reliance on an artist's community resources. Aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions (usually well over 100) but amounts to several percent (on the order of $500,000 in recent years) of the gross receipts from ticket sales. In 2006, 29 pieces were funded.\n\nVarious standards regarding the nature of the artworks eligible for grants are set by the Art Department, but compliance with the theme and interactivity are important considerations. This funding has fostered artistic communities, most notably in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area of California]], the region that has historically provided a majority of the event's participants. There are active and successful outreach efforts to enlarge the regional scope of the event and the grant program.\n\n=== ''No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man'' ===\nIn 2018, the Renwick Gallery of the American Art Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. brought the large-scale, participatory work from the desert gathering to the nation's capital for the first time.<ref name=\"americanart.si.edu\">{{Cite web |url = https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/burning-man |title = No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man |website = Smithsonian American Art Museum |access-date = 21 March 2018 }}</ref> The exhibition took over the entire Renwick Gallery building and surrounding neighborhood, bringing alive the maker culture and creative spirit of this cultural movement.

All outdoor works had been installed as honorarium artwork at Burning Man in years past, except for the artwork by Hybycozo. This outdoor exhibition was co-produced by a first ever collaboration with the Golden Triangle BID (Business Improvement District in Washington DC), curated by Karyn Miller.\n\n==Mutant vehicles==\n[[File:Burning man 2010 (4966356687).jpg|thumb|Praying Mantis truck (2010)]]\n\nMutant Vehicles are purpose-built or creatively altered motorized vehicles.  They are a subset of a type of vehicle known as an \"Art Car\", which refers to any standard vehicle that has been artistically modified.  The term \"Mutant Vehicle\" was coined by Organizers of the Burning Man event to delineate a type of \"Art Car\" that was more dramatically modified than simply decorating an existing vehicle.\n\nBurning Man participants who wish to bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the event's own DMV or \"Department of Mutant Vehicles\"<ref>https://burningman.org/event/black-rock-city-guide/infrastructure/dept-of-mutant-vehicles/</ref> for consideration.  If a vehicle design meets the \"Mutant Vehicle Criteria,<ref>https://burningman.org/event/art-performance/mutant-vehicles/mv-criteria-and-licensing/</ref> the vehicle is invited to the event for a final physical inspection and licensing at the the event. Not all designs and proposals are accepted. The event organizers, and in turn the DMV, have set the bar high for what it deems an acceptable MV each year, in effect capping the number of Mutant Vehicles. This is in response to constraints imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which grants permits to hold the event on federal property, and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment. Vehicles that are minimally altered, and/or whose primary function is to transport participants, are discouraged and not invited. One of the criteria the DMV employs to determine whether an application for a proposed Mutant Vehicle is approved is \"can you recognize the base vehicle\". For example, if a 1967 VW van covered with glitter, dolls' heads, and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a VW van, the DMV would consider it an \"Art Car\", but it would not be sufficiently altered to meet the Mutant Vehicle Criteria.\n\nThere were over six hundred approved Mutant Vehicles at the event in 2019<ref>https://www.motortrend.com/news/art-cars-mutant-vehicles-burning-man-2019/</ref>\n\n==Bicycles==\n[[File:BURNING MAN 2010 (4962240955).jpg|thumb|Cyclists at Burning Man (2010)]]\nBicycles and tricycles are popular for getting around on the dry lake. [[Mountain bikes]] are generally preferred over [[road bike]]s for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using [[electroluminescent wire]] (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over the frame of the bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of people on their bikes and art cars, illuminated sculptures and stages create a unique visual effect.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.viberate.com/article/how-much-will-burning-man-cost-you-plus-the-ultimate-black-rock-city-survival-guide/ |title = How much will Burning Man Cost You?

Terbo Ted was identified as having been the first ever DJ in Burning Man history, opening with a [[Jean Michel Jarre]] song played off a [[vinyl record]]. DJs typically occupied an area on the outskirts of the Playa nicknamed the \"Techno Ghetto\". In later years, designated spokes of the main camp were designated for \"sound camps\", with limits on volume and speaker positioning (angled away from the center of Black Rock City). To work around the rules, mutant vehicles with live DJs and large sound systems began to appear as well. A number of major electronic music camps have been well-known recurrents at Burning Man, including Opulent Temple and Robot Heart. Major producers and DJs representing various eras and genres have performed at Burning Man, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Markus Schulz]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian]] and [[Freq Nasty]] among others.<ref name=\"npr-burningmanedm\">{{cite web |title = Desert Music: Burning Man Confronts The Rising Beat |url = https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/09/02/436697747/desert-music-burning-man-confronts-the-rising-beat |publisher = NPR |accessdate = September 3, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |url = https://djmag.com/news/band-hooligans-vandalise-paul-oakenfolds-burning-man-camp |title = &quot;BAND OF HOOLIGANS&quot; VANDALISE PAUL OAKENFOLD&#039;S BURNING MAN CAMP |date = 2016-09-05 |website = DJMag.com |access-date = 2019-11-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, concerns began to surface among attendees that a growing number of \"mainstream\" [[electronic dance music]] acts (such as [[Skrillex]] and [[Diplo]]'s [[Jack \u00dc]] in 2014) had begun to appear.

Much of the layout and general city infrastructure is constructed by Department of Public Works (DPW) volunteers who often reside in Black Rock City for several weeks before and after the event.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/infrastructure/dpw.html |title = On The Playa |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/ |title = On The Playa |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref> The remainder of the city including theme camps, villages, art installations and individual camping are all created by participants.\n\n===City planning===\nThe developed part of the city is currently arranged as a series of concentric streets in an arc composing, since 1999, two-thirds of a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) diameter circle with the Man Sculpture and his supporting complex at the very center ({{CoordDec|40.786455|-119.206701}} in 2017). Radial streets, sometimes called Avenues, extend from the Man to the outermost circle. The outlines of these streets are visible on aerial photographs.[[File:Burning Man aerial.jpg|thumb|Oblique aerial photo of Black Rock City showing the familiar \"C\" pattern 2010]]The innermost street is named the ''Esplanade'', and the remaining streets are given names to coincide with the overall theme of the burn, and ordered in ways such as alphabetical order or stem to stern, to make them easier to recall. For example, in 1999, for the \"Wheel of Time\" theme, and again in 2004 for \"The Vault of Heaven\" theme, the streets were named after the planets of the solar system. The radial streets are usually given a clock designation, for example, 6:00 or 6:15, in which the Man is at the center of the clock face and 12:00 is in the middle of the third of the arc lacking streets (usually at a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of 60\u00b0 true from the Man). These avenues have been identified in other ways, notably in 2002, in accordance with \"The Floating World\" theme, as the degrees of a compass, for example 175 degrees, and in 2003 as part of the Beyond Belief theme as adjectives (\"Rational, Absurd\") that caused every intersection with a concentric street (named after concepts of belief such as \"Authority, Creed\") to form a phrase such as \"Absurd Authority\" or \"Rational Creed\". However, these proved unpopular with participants due to difficulty in navigating the city without the familiar clock layout.\n\nThe Black Rock City Airport is constructed adjacent to the city, typically on its southern side. See Transportation section below.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/airport/ |title = Black Rock City Airport |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Center Camp===\n[[File:Burning Man 2013 Cargo Cult (9625733758) (3).jpg|thumb|Bureau of Land Management officers and a Ranger at Burning Man]]\nCenter Camp is located along the midline of Black Rock City, facing the Man at the 6:00 position on the Esplanade. This area serves as a central meeting place for the entire city and contains the Center Camp Cafe, Camp Arctica and a number of other city institutions.\n\n===Villages and theme camps===\nVillages and theme camps are located along the innermost streets of Black Rock City, often offering entertainment or services to participants.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/31/BAGD0EFM9G1.DTL |title = Theme Camps |work = San Francisco Chronicle |date = August 31, 2005 |accessdate = 31 March 2012 |first = Meredith |last = May }}</ref>\n\nTheme camps are usually a collective of people representing themselves under a single identity. Villages are usually a collection of smaller theme camps which have banded together in order to share resources and vie for better placement.\n\nTheme camps and villages often form to create an atmosphere in Black Rock City that their group envisioned. As Burning Man grows every year it attracts an even more diverse crowd. Subcultures form around theme camps at Black Rock City similar to what can be found in other cities.\n\n===Volunteers===\nThe Burning Man event is heavily dependent on a large number of volunteers.<ref>Burningman.com [http://www.burningman.com/participate/volunteer.html Volunteering page]</ref>\n\n===Safety, policing and regulations===\nBlack Rock City is patrolled by various local and state [[police|law enforcement]] agencies as well as the [[Bureau of Land Management Rangers]]. The local police issue $1,500 fines for drug use and serving alcohol to minors. Burning Man also has its own in-house group of volunteers, the Black Rock Rangers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangers.burningman.com/about/ |title=Who are the Rangers? {{!}} Black Rock Rangers |website=rangers.burningman.com |access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref> who act as informal mediators when disputes arise between participants.\n\n[[Firefighting]], [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical services (EMS)]], mental health, and communications support is provided by the volunteer Black Rock City Emergency Services Department (ESD). Three \"[[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital|MASH]]\"-like stations are set up in the city: station 3, 6 and 9. Station 6 is staffed by physicians and nurses working with a contracted state licensed ALS Medical provider, while Stations 3 and 9 are staffed by Black Rock City ESD personnel. While Station 3 and 9 provide emergency services and basic life support, the volunteers are generally doctors, nurses, [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]]/[[paramedics]], and firefighters. Both station 3 and 9 have a small fire engines available in addition to a Hazardous material/ Rescue truck and [[quick response vehicle]] for medical emergencies.\n\nIn [[:File:FBI files on Burning Man.pdf|documents]] from February 2013 first made public on August 29, 2015, it was revealed that in August 2010, the [[FBI]] had sent a memo to its field offices in Nevada stating that it would patrol Burning Man to \"aid in the prevention of terrorist activities and intelligence collection\". Although a threat assessment performed by the FBI in consort with Burning Man's contracted security determined that drug usage and crowd control were the only major threats to Burning Man, the Bureau still sent an unspecified number of undercover officers to the event, with \"no adverse threats or reactions\".<ref>{{cite web |title = FBI admits to spying on Burning Man |url = http://www.rt.com/usa/314303-burning-man-fbi-spying/ |publisher = RT |accessdate = September 12, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Black Rock City design evolution ==\n\n=== 1986\u20131991 ===\nFrom the very beginning on Baker Beach, to 1991 when Burning Man was set into its desert home, there was no real organizational structure to the city. According to Rod Garret, designer of Black Rock City, \"The original form of the camp was a circle. This was not particularly planned, but formed instinctively from the traditional campfire circle and the urge to 'circle the wagons' against the nearly boundless space.\" This would not work for much longer, as attendance was reaching into the hundreds, and such a large gathering would require some planning.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |url = http://burningman.org/timeline/#!/1986 |title = Timeline \u2013 Burning Man }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://journal.burningman.org/2010/04/black-rock-city/building-brc/designing-black-rock-city/ |title = Designing Black Rock City |work = Burning Man Journal |access-date = 10 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1992\u20131995 ===\nThe [[Bureau of Land Management]] took notice of the event, and required that plans be drawn up to maintain safety. They also required the Burn to be registered as an official event. In response, four [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] roads were added emanating from center camp. The Man was located {{Convert|100|yd|m}} West of Center camp, due to the camp being oriented with the path of the sun across the sky, as opposed to North-to-South. The center circle from the birth of the event was maintained.\n\nIn 1993, the first sound camp was opened. It was known as the Techno Ghetto, and it was located 2 miles north of Center Camp. It was not a usual theme camp, but was instead a mini hub on its own; There was a small \"center camp\" with a message board and [[Portable toilet|Port-a-potties]]. The center was surrounded by a circle of camping area {{Convert|1200|ft|m}} across. Six massive sound systems faced out from the circle.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/9avb9a/death-and-ecstasy-the-rise-and-fall-of-burning-mans-original-rave-ghetto |title = Death and Ecstasy: The Rise and Fall of Burning Man's Original Rave Ghetto |date = August 31, 2015 |work = Thump |access-date = 14 July 2018 }}</ref> The Techno Ghetto was placed separately to keep the 'rave' out of the main event, yet as time has progressed, music has become more and more closely tied into the core culture of Burning man, even spawning a unique genre known as Playa Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.burn.life/blog/interview-with-the-founder-of-the-first-sound-camp-at-burning-man |title = Interview with the founder of Burning Man's first sound camp |website = Life |access-date = 14 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1996 ===\nWith the population growing to 8,000 in 1996, more structure was essential to both appease the Bureau of Land Management, and to maintain safety. A ring around Center Camp, aptly named Ring Road, was added to provide for a second circle of theme camps. In addition, the eastern section of the circle around Center camp in a cone shape was declared a \"No Man's Land\", devoid of all art installations and campsites. The goal was to provide a picturesque view from Center Camp of The Man in the distance. In addition to the camps circling the Center, there were also camps lining the outside of the No Man's Land cone.\n\nThe techno ghetto would remain for one last year in 1996, and it wouldn't return. Regardless, the spark of music had ignited, and many other sound camps would follow.\n\n=== 1997 ===\nIn 1997 Burning Man was relocated. The event moved off of the [[Black Rock Desert|Playa]] to the [[Hualapai Flat]], due to political problems with [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]. Black Rock City truly became a city in 1997, with formal, labeled streets, zoning, and registration for vehicles and theme camps. Rod Garret was brought on board as the lead designer of Black Rock City from then on.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.burn.life/1997-2000-maturation.html |title = Burning Man 1997\u20132000 |website = Life |access-date = 14 July 2018 }}</ref> In his design, Center Camp remained the starting point, with two angular arms reaching out on either side to form a shallow \"V\" shape around the Man. These main arms consisted of six annular roads, and two outlying plazas. 1997 is the first year of a Ranger-patrolled perimeter, and also the first year of one entry gate.\n\n=== 1998 ===\nBurning Man returned to the playa in 1998, and the basis of the modern layout was implemented. The idea was to \"recreate some of the intimacy of our original camping circle, but on a much larger civic scale.\" Rod Garret's design smoothed out the angular \"V\" from 1997 and implemented the arc, although in 1998, it stretched less than half-way around the circle. The radial streets were numbered North 1\u201320 and South 1\u201320, instead of the modern clock face system of names such as 11:30 or 5:15. There were four large plazas, each occupied by a major theme camp.\n\n=== 1999\u20132010 ===\nIn 1999, for the '''Wheel of Time''' theme, the great arc of the city was expanded to the full 240\u00b0 (\u2154 of a circle) that it is today. The streets were re-numbered to correspond to a [[clock face]], with the Man in the center, Center Camp at 6:00, and streets every 30 minutes (15\u00b0) 2:00 through 10:00.\n\n2000 saw the introduction of the Temple as a fixture on the playa, and it has grown to be easily as important as the Man. It was placed at 12:00 out in the deep playa in the open third of the circle. 2000 also marked the year that the concept of a loud side and a quiet side was replaced by the rule that large scale sound camps would be placed at the 10:00 and 2:00 edges, facing out into the deep playa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/afterburn/06-2/history/|title=History {{!}} Burning Man|website=burningman.org|access-date=14 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nExtra annular streets have been added as need has increased.\n\n=== 2011\u2013present ===\nIn 2011, extra radial streets were added from G street out to make outer-city navigation easier. These streets were added at intervals of fifteen minutes.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{See also|Black Rock Desert#Transportation}}\n\n===Road access===\n[[Nevada State Route 34|Highway 34]] provides access to the main entrance to Black Rock City. The highway connects to [[Nevada State Route 447|Highway 447]] north of [[Gerlach, Nevada|Gerlach]], which then runs south to [[Nevada State Route 447|Highway 427]] in [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]] near [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]].<ref>{{cite web |date = January 2008 |title = Nevada State Maintained Highways: Descriptions, Index and Maps |publisher = Roadway Systems Division |url = http://www.nevadadot.com/reports_pubs/state_maintained/pdf/sm_book.pdf |accessdate = 28 May 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091109231856/https://www.nevadadot.com/reports_pubs/state_maintained/pdf/sm_book.pdf |archivedate = November 9, 2009 |df = }}</ref>\n\nVehicles then proceed from the Highway 34 entrance north to the main gate via Gate Road, a desert dirt road with a speed limit of 10&nbsp;mph. All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass, and all occupants are required to have valid ticket, in order to get in. Vehicles are also searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at Will Call, the booths are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate.

At regular intervals (usually an hour during the peak periods), all vehicles are \"pulsed\" forward all at once for about a mile along Gate Road. This allows vehicles to stop and turn off their engines, while those at southernmost mile of the multi-lane Gate Road slowly merge and then turn onto the [[Single carriageway|two-lane]] Highway 34.<ref name=\"Exodus\">{{cite web |url = http://burningman.org/event/preparation/getting-there-and-back/exodus/ |title = Getting Out: Exodus |publisher = Burning Man |accessdate = 2 September 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Commercial airports===\nThe airport with regular commercial service closest to the event is the [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]] in [[Reno]], Nevada, over two hours' drive away. According to an airport spokesperson, in 2018 an estimated 18,000 burners arrived and departed through Reno's airport for the event, thereby giving the airport an $11 million boost.

When it was finally determined that they did not dissipate with the annual winter rains and flooding, in 2000, the organization declared that fires had to be elevated from the playa surface for its protection. When it was discovered by two of the founders of the Friends of Black Rock / High Rock (Garth Elliott & Sue Weeks) and BLM Winnemucca district director Terry Reid that Burn scars from prior sites (numbering 250) still remained, they were finally eradicated in 2000 by the DPW clean up crew headed by Dan Miller.\n\nOn the last day of the event, public shared burn areas are prepared for participants to use.
