The Tigers, led by second-year head coach [[Brian Collins (basketball)|Brian Collins]], played their home games at the [[Gentry Complex]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] as members of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]]. They finished the season 18\u201315, 9\u20139 in OVC play to finish in a tie for fifth place. They defeated [[2019\u201320 Morehead State Eagles men's basketball team|Morehead State]] in the first round of the [[2020 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|OVC Tournament]] before losing in the quarterfinals to [[2019\u201320 Eastern Kentucky Colonels men's basketball team|Eastern Kentucky]]. They accepted an invitation to participate in the [[2020 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament]] and were set to host a first round game. However, the CIT was cancelled amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]].\n\n==Previous season==\nThe [[2018\u201319 Tennessee State Tigers basketball team|Tigers]] finished the [[2018\u201319 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2018\u201319 season]] 9\u201321 overall, 6\u201312 during OVC play, and finishing in a four-way tie for seventh place.

They finished the season 18\u201315, 9\u20139 in OVC play to finish in a tie for fifth place.
