Beginning in the mid-19th century, aside from the work being done by women for broad-based economic and political equality and for social reforms, women sought to change voting laws to allow them to vote.<ref>[[History of Woman Suffrage]]</ref> National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards that objective, especially the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (founded in 1904 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]), as well as for equal civil rights for women.<ref>Allison Sneider,  \"The New Suffrage History: Voting Rights in International Perspective\", ''History Compass,'' (July 2010) 8#7 pp. 692\u2013703,</ref>\n\nWomen who owned property gained the right to vote in the [[Isle of Man]] in 1881, and in 1893, women in the then British [[colony of New Zealand]] were granted the right to vote. In Australia, women progressively gained the right to vote between 1894 and 1911 (federally in 1902).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Australia and New Zealand|last=Christine.|first=Lindop|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-423390-3|location=Oxford|page=27|oclc=361237847}}</ref> Most major Western powers extended voting rights to women in the interwar period, including Canada (1917), Britain and Germany (1918), Austria and the Netherlands (1919) and the United States (1920). Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (1952), and Switzerland (1971).\n\n[[Leslie P. Hume|Leslie Hume]] argues that the First World War changed the popular mood:\n\n: The women's contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the [[voting booth]]. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Hume|title=The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies 1897\u20131914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1TlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT281|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=281|isbn=978-1-317-21326-0 }}</ref>\n\nExtended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before [[universal suffrage]] for men; for instance, literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it. The [[United Nations]] encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (1979) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this Convention.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:AnnaIIStolQued.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Anna II, Abbess of Quedlinburg]].

Through subsequent centuries, Europe was generally ruled by monarchs, though various forms of parliament arose at different times.

As a delegate to the National Labor Congress in 1868, Anthony persuaded the committee on female labor to call for votes for women and equal pay for equal work.

The first general election at which women could vote was the [[1933 South African general election|1933&nbsp;election]]. At that election [[Leila Reitz]] (wife of [[Deneys Reitz]]) was elected as the first female&nbsp;MP, representing [[Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]]. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the [[Cape Province]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to white foreign nationals when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.\n\nThe right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]], was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult [[coloured]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1981. In 1984 the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was established, and the right to vote for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] and [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.\n\nIn 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] was granted to all adult citizens.\n\n====Southern Rhodesia====\nSouthern Rhodesian white women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie&nbsp;(1875\u20131950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920\u20131928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outside Westminster. The influx of women settlers from Britain proved a decisive factor in the 1922&nbsp;referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner Nationalists]] in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or \"responsible government\".<ref>See Lowry, 1997</ref> Black Rhodesian males qualified for the vote in 1923 (based only upon property, assets, income, and literacy).

Web. 4 Oct. 2016.</ref>\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[Bangladesh]] was (mostly) the province of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.<ref>Dilara Choudhury, and Al Masud Hasanuzzaman,  \"Political Decision-Making in Bangladesh and the Role of Women,\" ''Asian Profile,'' (Feb 1997) 25#1 pp. 53\u201369</ref>\n\n====India====\n{{main|Women's suffrage in India}}\nWomen in India were allowed to vote right from the first general elections after the independence of India in 1947 unlike during the British rule who resisted allowing women to vote.<ref name=\"BBCWomen\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43081429|title=Did the Empire resist women's suffrage in India?|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|date=2018-02-22|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1917. It sought votes for women and the right to hold legislative office on the same basis as men. These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref name = Basu>Aparna Basu, \"Women's Struggle for the Vote: 1917\u20131937,\" ''Indian Historical Review,'' (Jan 2008) 35#1 pp. 128\u201343</ref> British and [[Feminism in India|Indian feminists]] combined in 1918 to publish a magazine ''Stri Dharma'' that featured international news from a feminist perspective.<ref>Michelle Elizabeth Tusan, \"Writing Stri Dharma: international feminism, nationalist politics, and women's press advocacy in late colonial India,\" ''[[Women's History Review]],'' (Dec 2003) 12#4 pp. 623\u201349</ref> In 1919 in the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]], the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being [[monarchy|monarchies]]).<ref name = Basu/> In [[Bengal]] province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.<ref>Barbara Southard, \"Colonial Politics and Women's Rights: Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Bengal, British India in the 1920s,\" ''[[Modern Asian Studies]],'' (March 1993) 27#2 pp. 397\u2013439</ref>\n\nWhereas wealthy and educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This happened when the Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[sacred scripture]] of the Sikh faith.\n\nIn the [[Government of India Act 1935]] the [[British Raj]] set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women's leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.<ref>Basu (Jan 2008), 140\u201343</ref>\n\n====Indonesia====\n[[Indonesia]] granted women voting rights for municipal councils in 1905. Only men who could read and write could vote, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the [[Literacy|literacy rate]] for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group that pressed for women's suffrage in Indonesia was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association), founded in the [[Netherlands]] in 1894. VVV tried to attract Indonesian members, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the first national representative body, the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], was formed which still excluded women from voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, women gained the right to be elected to urban representative institutions, which led to some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils.

The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a white settler nation. While the women's suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of white women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked white women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \"racial degeneration.\"<ref>Anne-Marie.

Women involved in larger movements for social justice began to agitate equal rights and opportunities on par with men; following the example of their European peers, Elvira Dellepiane Rawson, [[Cecilia Grierson]] and [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]] began to form a number of groups in defense of the civil rights of women between 1900 and 1910.  The first major victories for extending the civil rights of women occurred in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|Province of San Juan]].  Women had been allowed to vote in that province since 1862, but only in municipal elections.  A similar right was extended in the [[Santa Fe Province|province of Santa Fe]] where a constitution that ensured women's suffrage was enacted at the municipal level, although female participation in votes initially remained low. In 1927, San Juan sanctioned its Constitution and broadly recognized the equal rights of men and women. However, the [[1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|1930 coup]] overthrew these advances.\n\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Balvanera - Manifestaci\u00f3n por el voto femenino en 1948.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Women's demonstration in Buenos Aires in front of the National Congress by law for universal suffrage, 1947]]\n\nA great pioneer of women's suffrage was [[Julieta Lanteri]], the daughter of Italian immigrants, who in 1910 requested a national court to grant her the right to citizenship (at the time not generally given to single female immigrants) as well as suffrage. The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: \"As a judge, I have a duty to declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived of what they do not prohibit.\"\n\nIn July 1911, [[Julieta Lanteri|Dr. Lanteri]] were enumerated, and on November 26 of that year exercised her right to vote, the first Ibero-American woman to vote. Also covered in a judgment in 1919 was presented as a candidate for national deputy for the Independent Centre Party, obtaining 1,730 votes out of 154,302.\n\nIn 1919, Rogelio Araya UCR Argentina had gone down in history for being the first to submit a bill recognizing the right to vote for women, an essential component of universal suffrage. On July 17, 1919, he served as deputy national on behalf of the people of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]].\n\nOn February 27, 1946, three days after the [[1946 Argentine general election|elections]] that consecrated president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his wife First Lady [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] 26 years of age gave his first political speech in an organized women to thank them for their support of Per\u00f3n's candidacy. On that occasion, Eva demanded equal rights for men and women and particularly, women's suffrage:\n\n{{quote|The woman Argentina has exceeded the period of civil tutorials. Women must assert their action, women should vote. The woman, moral spring home, you should take the place in the complex social machinery of the people.

It requires, in short, the transformation of the concept of woman who sacrificially has increased the number of its duties without seeking the minimum of their rights.}}\n\nThe bill was presented the new constitutional government assumed immediately after the May 1, 1946. The opposition of conservative bias was evident, not only the opposition parties but even within parties who supported [[Peronism]]. Eva Per\u00f3n constantly pressured the parliament for approval, even causing protests from the latter for this intrusion.\n\nAlthough it was a brief text in three articles, that practically could not give rise to discussions, the Senate recently gave preliminary approval to the project August 21, 1946, and had to wait over a year for the House of Representative to publish the September 9, 1947 Law 13,010, establishing equal political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in [[Argentina]]. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously.\n\n[[File:Eva Per\u00f3n votando.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Eva Per\u00f3n]] voting at the hospital in 1951.

It was the first and only time she would vote; Per\u00f3n died July 26, 1952 after developing cervical cancer.]]\n\nIn an official statement on national television, Eva Per\u00f3n announced the extension of suffrage to Argentina's women:\n\n{{quote|Women of this country, this very instant I receive from the Government the law that enshrines our civic rights. And I receive it in front of you, with the confidence that I do so on behalf and in the name of all Argentinian women. I do so joyously, as I feel my hands tremble upon contact with victory proclaiming laurels. Here it is, my sisters, summarized into few articles of compact letters lies a long history of battles, stumbles, and hope.\nBecause of this, in it there lie exasperating indignation, shadows of menacing sunsets, but also cheerful awakenings of triumphal auroras. And the latter which translates the victory of women over the incomprehensions, the denials, and the interests created by the castes now repudiated by our national awakening.\nAnd a leader who destiny forged to victoriously face the problems of our era, General [Per\u00f3n]. With him, and our vote we shall contribute to the perfection of Argentina's democracy, my dear comrades.}}\n\nOn 23 September 1947, they enacted the Female Enrollment Act (No. 13,010) during the first presidency of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, which was implemented in the [[1951 Argentine general election|elections of November 11, 1951]], in which 3,816,654 women voted (63.9% voted for the [[Justicialist Party]] and 30.8% for the [[Radical Civic Union]]).

''Woman Suffrage in Mexico''. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1962.</ref>\n\n====Venezuela====\nAfter the [[Generation of 1928|1928 Student Protests]], women started participating more actively in politics.  In 1935, women's rights supporters founded the Feminine Cultural Group (known as 'ACF' from its initials in Spanish), with the goal of tackling women's problems. The group supported women's political and social rights, and believed it was necessary to involve and inform women about these issues in order to ensure their personal development. It went on to give seminars, as well as founding night schools and the House of Laboring Women.\n\nGroups looking to reform the 1936 Civil Code of Conduct in conjunction with the Venezuelan representation to the Union of American Women called the First Feminine Venezuelan Congress in 1940. In this congress, delegates discussed the situation of women in Venezuela and their demands. Key goals were women's suffrage and a reform to the Civil Code of Conduct. Around twelve thousand signatures were collected and handed to the Venezuelan Congress, which reformed the Civil Code of Conduct in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, groups supporting women's suffrage, the most important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained the right to vote at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the Correo C\u00edvico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the [[1945 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat|1945 Venezuelan Coup d'\u00c9tat]] and the [[1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election|call for a new Constitution]], to which women were elected, women's suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.\n\n==In non-religious organizations==\nThe right of women to vote has sometimes been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, it was not until 1964 that women in the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] in the United States were first allowed to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nad.org/nad-history#1970s |title=NAD History; National Association of the Deaf |publisher=Nad.org |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n===Catholicism===\nThe [[Pope]] is elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp |title=How is the Pope elected? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=2005-04-06 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Women are not appointed as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |title=Women and the Priesthood |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=2011-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904055106/http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |archivedate=2011-09-04 |df= }}</ref> The female Catholic offices of [[Abbess]] or Mother Superior are elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Women in Islam}}\nIn some countries, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Goodstein|first1=Laurie}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{see also|Women in Judaism}}\nIn Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and most Orthodox Jewish movements women have the right to vote.

Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (1952), and Switzerland (1971).\n\n[[Leslie P. Hume|Leslie Hume]] argues that the First World War changed the popular mood:\n\n: The women's contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the [[voting booth]]. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Hume|title=The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies 1897\u20131914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1TlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT281|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=281|isbn=978-1-317-21326-0 }}</ref>\n\nExtended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before [[universal suffrage]] for men; for instance, literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it. The [[United Nations]] encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (1979) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this Convention.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:AnnaIIStolQued.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Anna II, Abbess of Quedlinburg]].

The first general election at which women could vote was the [[1933 South African general election|1933&nbsp;election]]. At that election [[Leila Reitz]] (wife of [[Deneys Reitz]]) was elected as the first female&nbsp;MP, representing [[Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]]. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the [[Cape Province]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to white foreign nationals when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.\n\nThe right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]], was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult [[coloured]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1981. In 1984 the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was established, and the right to vote for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] and [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.\n\nIn 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] was granted to all adult citizens.\n\n====Southern Rhodesia====\nSouthern Rhodesian white women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie&nbsp;(1875\u20131950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920\u20131928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outside Westminster. The influx of women settlers from Britain proved a decisive factor in the 1922&nbsp;referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner Nationalists]] in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or \"responsible government\".<ref>See Lowry, 1997</ref> Black Rhodesian males qualified for the vote in 1923 (based only upon property, assets, income, and literacy).

Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions.

These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref name = Basu>Aparna Basu, \"Women's Struggle for the Vote: 1917\u20131937,\" ''Indian Historical Review,'' (Jan 2008) 35#1 pp. 128\u201343</ref> British and [[Feminism in India|Indian feminists]] combined in 1918 to publish a magazine ''Stri Dharma'' that featured international news from a feminist perspective.<ref>Michelle Elizabeth Tusan, \"Writing Stri Dharma: international feminism, nationalist politics, and women's press advocacy in late colonial India,\" ''[[Women's History Review]],'' (Dec 2003) 12#4 pp. 623\u201349</ref> In 1919 in the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]], the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being [[monarchy|monarchies]]).<ref name = Basu/> In [[Bengal]] province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.<ref>Barbara Southard, \"Colonial Politics and Women's Rights: Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Bengal, British India in the 1920s,\" ''[[Modern Asian Studies]],'' (March 1993) 27#2 pp. 397\u2013439</ref>\n\nWhereas wealthy and educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This happened when the Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[sacred scripture]] of the Sikh faith.\n\nIn the [[Government of India Act 1935]] the [[British Raj]] set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women's leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.<ref>Basu (Jan 2008), 140\u201343</ref>\n\n====Indonesia====\n[[Indonesia]] granted women voting rights for municipal councils in 1905. Only men who could read and write could vote, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the [[Literacy|literacy rate]] for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group that pressed for women's suffrage in Indonesia was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association), founded in the [[Netherlands]] in 1894. VVV tried to attract Indonesian members, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the first national representative body, the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], was formed which still excluded women from voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, women gained the right to be elected to urban representative institutions, which led to some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, only European women and municipal councils could vote,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}<!-- how can a municipal council be a voter? --> excluding all other women and [[Local government|local councils]]. In September 1941, the Volksraad extended the vote to women of all races. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (subject to property and educational qualifications).<ref name=Blackburn>Blackburn, Susan, 'Winning the Vote for Women in Indonesia' ''Australian Feminist Studies'', Volume 14, Number 29, 1 April 1999, pp. 207\u201318</ref>\n\n====Iran====\n{{see also|1963 Iranian referendum}}\nA [[1963 Iranian referendum|referendum in January 1963]] overwhelmingly approved by voters gave women the right to vote, a right previously denied to them under the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|Iranian Constitution of 1906]] pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 3.<ref name=Timeline />\n\n====Israel====\nWomen have had full suffrage since the [[Israel's independence|establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948.\n\nThe first (and as of 2020, the only) woman to be elected [[Prime Minister of Israel]] was [[Golda Meir]] in 1969.\n\n====Japan====\n[[File:Woman's Rights Meeting Tokyo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Women's Rights meeting in [[Tokyo]], to push for women's suffrage]]\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Japan}}\n\nAlthough women were allowed to vote in some prefectures in 1880, women's suffrage was enacted at a national level in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305105909/http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archivedate=2008-03-05 |title=The Fusae Ichikawa Memorial Association |publisher=Ichikawa-fusae.or.jp |accessdate=2011-01-08}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 January 2014.</ref>\n\n'''Korea'''\n\nSouth Korean women were granted the vote in 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/empowerment-women-south-korea|title=The Empowerment of Women in South Korea|date=2014-03-11|work=JIA SIPA|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Kuwait====\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Kuwait}}\nWhen voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the [[right to vote]].<ref name=\"stat\">{{Cite book|year=2001|title=African Women and Children: Crisis and Response|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom/page/8 8]|author=Apollo Rwomire|isbn=978-0-275-96218-0}}</ref> The right was later removed.

In 1889, Wilhelmina Drucker founded a women's movement called [[Vrije Vrouwen Vereeniging]] (Free Women\u2019s Union) and it was from this movement that the campaign for women's suffrage in the Netherlands emerged. This movement got a lot of support from other countries, especially from the women's suffrage movement in England.

When this letter was rejected, in spite of popular support, the movement organised several demonstrations and protests in favor of women's suffrage.

Women involved in larger movements for social justice began to agitate equal rights and opportunities on par with men; following the example of their European peers, Elvira Dellepiane Rawson, [[Cecilia Grierson]] and [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]] began to form a number of groups in defense of the civil rights of women between 1900 and 1910.  The first major victories for extending the civil rights of women occurred in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|Province of San Juan]].  Women had been allowed to vote in that province since 1862, but only in municipal elections.  A similar right was extended in the [[Santa Fe Province|province of Santa Fe]] where a constitution that ensured women's suffrage was enacted at the municipal level, although female participation in votes initially remained low. In 1927, San Juan sanctioned its Constitution and broadly recognized the equal rights of men and women. However, the [[1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|1930 coup]] overthrew these advances.\n\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Balvanera - Manifestaci\u00f3n por el voto femenino en 1948.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Women's demonstration in Buenos Aires in front of the National Congress by law for universal suffrage, 1947]]\n\nA great pioneer of women's suffrage was [[Julieta Lanteri]], the daughter of Italian immigrants, who in 1910 requested a national court to grant her the right to citizenship (at the time not generally given to single female immigrants) as well as suffrage. The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: \"As a judge, I have a duty to declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived of what they do not prohibit.\"\n\nIn July 1911, [[Julieta Lanteri|Dr. Lanteri]] were enumerated, and on November 26 of that year exercised her right to vote, the first Ibero-American woman to vote. Also covered in a judgment in 1919 was presented as a candidate for national deputy for the Independent Centre Party, obtaining 1,730 votes out of 154,302.\n\nIn 1919, Rogelio Araya UCR Argentina had gone down in history for being the first to submit a bill recognizing the right to vote for women, an essential component of universal suffrage. On July 17, 1919, he served as deputy national on behalf of the people of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]].\n\nOn February 27, 1946, three days after the [[1946 Argentine general election|elections]] that consecrated president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his wife First Lady [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] 26 years of age gave his first political speech in an organized women to thank them for their support of Per\u00f3n's candidacy. On that occasion, Eva demanded equal rights for men and women and particularly, women's suffrage:\n\n{{quote|The woman Argentina has exceeded the period of civil tutorials. Women must assert their action, women should vote. The woman, moral spring home, you should take the place in the complex social machinery of the people.

The opposition of conservative bias was evident, not only the opposition parties but even within parties who supported [[Peronism]]. Eva Per\u00f3n constantly pressured the parliament for approval, even causing protests from the latter for this intrusion.\n\nAlthough it was a brief text in three articles, that practically could not give rise to discussions, the Senate recently gave preliminary approval to the project August 21, 1946, and had to wait over a year for the House of Representative to publish the September 9, 1947 Law 13,010, establishing equal political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in [[Argentina]]. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously.\n\n[[File:Eva Per\u00f3n votando.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Eva Per\u00f3n]] voting at the hospital in 1951.

It was the first and only time she would vote; Per\u00f3n died July 26, 1952 after developing cervical cancer.]]\n\nIn an official statement on national television, Eva Per\u00f3n announced the extension of suffrage to Argentina's women:\n\n{{quote|Women of this country, this very instant I receive from the Government the law that enshrines our civic rights.

Here it is, my sisters, summarized into few articles of compact letters lies a long history of battles, stumbles, and hope.\nBecause of this, in it there lie exasperating indignation, shadows of menacing sunsets, but also cheerful awakenings of triumphal auroras. And the latter which translates the victory of women over the incomprehensions, the denials, and the interests created by the castes now repudiated by our national awakening.\nAnd a leader who destiny forged to victoriously face the problems of our era, General [Per\u00f3n]. With him, and our vote we shall contribute to the perfection of Argentina's democracy, my dear comrades.}}\n\nOn 23 September 1947, they enacted the Female Enrollment Act (No. 13,010) during the first presidency of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, which was implemented in the [[1951 Argentine general election|elections of November 11, 1951]], in which 3,816,654 women voted (63.9% voted for the [[Justicialist Party]] and 30.8% for the [[Radical Civic Union]]).

Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1962.</ref>\n\n====Venezuela====\nAfter the [[Generation of 1928|1928 Student Protests]], women started participating more actively in politics.  In 1935, women's rights supporters founded the Feminine Cultural Group (known as 'ACF' from its initials in Spanish), with the goal of tackling women's problems. The group supported women's political and social rights, and believed it was necessary to involve and inform women about these issues in order to ensure their personal development. It went on to give seminars, as well as founding night schools and the House of Laboring Women.\n\nGroups looking to reform the 1936 Civil Code of Conduct in conjunction with the Venezuelan representation to the Union of American Women called the First Feminine Venezuelan Congress in 1940. In this congress, delegates discussed the situation of women in Venezuela and their demands. Key goals were women's suffrage and a reform to the Civil Code of Conduct. Around twelve thousand signatures were collected and handed to the Venezuelan Congress, which reformed the Civil Code of Conduct in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, groups supporting women's suffrage, the most important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained the right to vote at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the Correo C\u00edvico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the [[1945 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat|1945 Venezuelan Coup d'\u00c9tat]] and the [[1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election|call for a new Constitution]], to which women were elected, women's suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.\n\n==In non-religious organizations==\nThe right of women to vote has sometimes been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, it was not until 1964 that women in the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] in the United States were first allowed to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nad.org/nad-history#1970s |title=NAD History; National Association of the Deaf |publisher=Nad.org |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n===Catholicism===\nThe [[Pope]] is elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp |title=How is the Pope elected? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=2005-04-06 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Women are not appointed as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |title=Women and the Priesthood |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=2011-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904055106/http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |archivedate=2011-09-04 |df= }}</ref> The female Catholic offices of [[Abbess]] or Mother Superior are elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Women in Islam}}\nIn some countries, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Goodstein|first1=Laurie}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{see also|Women in Judaism}}\nIn Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and most Orthodox Jewish movements women have the right to vote.
