It has a long, decurved bill, and cinnamon-coloured plumage, the wings being boldly barred in black and white. The tail is black and a long, cinnamon crest with black-tipped feathers can be raised when the bird is alarmed. The wings are broad and rounded; the characteristic flight consists of a few beats after which the wings are folded momentarily and the bird glides, before resuming flapping.

Its diet consists mainly of insects such as beetles and flies and their larvae, grasshoppers and caterpillars.

Little nesting material is used and the hole becomes messy and smelly before the young fledge. One nest had a clutch of six bluish-grey eggs. Incubation may possibly be done solely by the female, and the partner has been observed feeding the incubating bird.
