It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue cancelled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick where the match's titular briefcase will be suspended above a ring on the building's roof.

The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]'s [[WWE Championship]] or [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]'s [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nAs with WWE's other programming since mid-March, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] necessitated changes to the PPV; Money in the Bank was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> On March 30, however, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> An advertisement promoting Money in the Bank aired during [[WrestleMania 36]] Part 2 on April 5, but with no reference to a venue.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell\u2019s live review of Night Two featuring Brock Lesnar vs. Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship, John Cena vs. \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt in a Firefly Funhouse match, Edge vs. Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match, Rhea Ripley vs. Charlotte Flair for the NXT Women\u2019s Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/05/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-two-featuring-brock-lesnar-vs-drew-mcintyre-for-the-wwe-championship-john-cena-vs-the-fiend-bray-wyatt-in-a-firefly-funhouse-match/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 5, 2020|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently, Royal Farms Arena cancelled all events due to the pandemic and began issuing refunds.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWWE initially did not announce whether the event would still go on from a different location (such as the [[WWE Performance Center]] in [[Orlando]] where most WWE shows have been held since mid-March),<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK WILL NOT TAKE PLACE IN BALTIMORE, ROYAL FARMS ARENA ANNOUNCES CANCELLATION|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/135465/wwe-money-in-the-bank-will-not-take-place-in-baltimore-royal-farms-arena-announces-cancellation.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|date=April 9, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last=Wilen|first=Jerome|title=WWE Money in the Bank pay-per view not taking place in Baltimore due to COVID-19|url=https://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/153495-wwe-money-in-the-bank-pay-per-view-canceled-covid-19/|work=WrestleView|date=April 9, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> but on the April 17 episode of ''SmackDown'', it was announced that the two Money in the Bank ladder matches would take place at WWE's [[Titan Towers|global headquarters]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].

The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]'s [[WWE Championship]] or [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]'s [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nAs with WWE's other programming since mid-March, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] necessitated changes to the PPV; Money in the Bank was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> On March 30, however, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> An advertisement promoting Money in the Bank aired during [[WrestleMania 36]] Part 2 on April 5, but with no reference to a venue.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell\u2019s live review of Night Two featuring Brock Lesnar vs. Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship, John Cena vs. \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt in a Firefly Funhouse match, Edge vs. Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match, Rhea Ripley vs. Charlotte Flair for the NXT Women\u2019s Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/05/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-two-featuring-brock-lesnar-vs-drew-mcintyre-for-the-wwe-championship-john-cena-vs-the-fiend-bray-wyatt-in-a-firefly-funhouse-match/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 5, 2020|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently, Royal Farms Arena cancelled all events due to the pandemic and began issuing refunds.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWWE initially did not announce whether the event would still go on from a different location (such as the [[WWE Performance Center]] in [[Orlando]] where most WWE shows have been held since mid-March),<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK WILL NOT TAKE PLACE IN BALTIMORE, ROYAL FARMS ARENA ANNOUNCES CANCELLATION|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/135465/wwe-money-in-the-bank-will-not-take-place-in-baltimore-royal-farms-arena-announces-cancellation.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|date=April 9, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last=Wilen|first=Jerome|title=WWE Money in the Bank pay-per view not taking place in Baltimore due to COVID-19|url=https://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/153495-wwe-money-in-the-bank-pay-per-view-canceled-covid-19/|work=WrestleView|date=April 9, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> but on the April 17 episode of ''SmackDown'', it was announced that the two Money in the Bank ladder matches would take place at WWE's [[Titan Towers|global headquarters]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].
