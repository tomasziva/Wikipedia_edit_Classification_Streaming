Accelerated soil erosion due to [[overgrazing]], and [[Pre-Columbian]] [[terraforming]] the Amazon basin resulting in [[Terra Preta]] are two examples of the effects of man's management.\n\nThe organisms living in and on the soil form distinct [[soil type]]s. [[Coniferous forest]]s have acidic [[leaf litter]] that form soils classed as [[inceptisols]]. Mixed or [[deciduous forest]]s leave a deeper layer of [[humus]] and tend to form soils classed as [[alfisols]]. Prairies have very high humus accumulation, which, along with [[bioturbation]] can create a dark, thick [[soil horizon|A horizon]] characteristic of [[mollisols]].\n\nSoil biology affects mineral weathering, and helps determine to what degree minerals leach from or accumulate in the soil. Biologically mediated chemical weathering can create striking differences in [[soil color|color]] [[soil horizon|stratification]].\n\nDistinct ecosystems produce distinct soils, sometimes in easily observable ways. For example, three species of [[land snail]]s in the genus ''[[Euchondrus]]'' in the [[Negev desert]] are noted for eating [[lichen]]s growing under the surface [[limestone]] rocks and slabs ([[endolithic]] lichens).<ref name=\"Odling-Smee 2003\"/> They disrupt and eat the limestone.<ref name=\"Odling-Smee 2003\"/> Their grazing results in the [[weathering]] of the stones, and the subsequent formation of soil.<ref name=\"Odling-Smee 2003\">Odling-Smee F.

For example, the [[chernozem]]s of the North American tallgrass prairie have a humus fraction nearly half of which is charcoal. This outcome was not anticipated because the antecedent prairie [[fire ecology]] capable of producing these distinct deep rich black soils is not easily observed.<ref>{{citation |last1=Ponomarenko |first1=E.V. |last2=Anderson |first2=D.W. |title=Importance of charred organic matter in Black Chernozem soils of Saskatchewan |year=2001 |journal=Canadian Journal of Soil Science |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=285\u2013297 |quote= The present paradigm views humus as a system of heteropolycondensates, largely produced by the soil microflora, in varying associations with clay (Anderson 1979). Because this conceptual model, and simulation models rooted within the concept, do not accommodate a large char component, a considerable change in conceptual understanding (a paradigm shift) appears imminent.|doi=10.4141/S00-075 }}</ref>\n\n===Relief===\nThe location of a soil on a landscape can affect how the climatic processes impact it. \nThe [[geomorphic]] effects of relief and topography determine how soil is moved, distributed and retained within a watershed and across the landscape. \nSoil material is carried to lower elevations by water and with gravity. \nBottom lands and low lands that retain and accumulate deposited soil will be deeper and richer with organic matter than their comparable uplands.\n\nSoils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes, and soils on the slopes that [[Aspect (geography)|face]] the [[sun path|sun's path]] will be drier than soils on slopes that do not. \nTopography determines exposure to weather, fire, and other forces of man and nature. \nMineral accumulations, plant nutrients, type of vegetation, vegetation growth, erosion, and water drainage are dependent on topographic relief.\n\nRecurring patterns of topography result in toposequences or [[catena (soil)|soil catenas]]. \nThese patterns emerge from topographic differences in erosion, deposition, fertility, soil moisture, plant cover, other soil biology, fire-history, and exposure to the elements. \nThese same differences are important to understanding natural history and when managing the land resource.\n\n===Parent material===\nThe primary material from which soil is formed is called [[parent material]]. Soil parent material could be bedrock, organic material, an old soil surface, or a deposit from water, wind, glaciers, volcanoes, or material moving down a slope.\n\n===Time===\nAll of the above factors assert themselves over time, often thousands of years. [[Soil profile]]s continually change from weakly developed to well developed over time. [[Chronosequence]]s used in soil studies consist of sites that have developed over different periods of time with relatively small differences in other soil-forming factors. Such groups of sites are used to assess the influence of time as a factor in pedogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huggett |first1=R.J |title=Soil chronosequences, soil development, and soil evolution: a critical review |journal=Catena |date=1998 |volume=32 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=155\u2013172 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(98)00053-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Paleosol]]s are soils formed during previous soil forming conditions.\n\n==Soil forming processes==\nSoils develop from [[parent material]] by various [[weathering]] processes. [[Organic matter]] accumulation, [[decomposition]], and [[humus|humification]] are as critically important to soil formation as weathering. The zone of humification and weathering is termed the [[solum]].\n\n[[Soil acidification]] resulting from [[soil respiration]] supports [[weathering#chemical weathering|chemical weathering]]. Plants contribute to chemical weathering through root exudates.\n\nSoils can be enriched by deposition of [[sediment]]s on [[floodplain]]s and alluvial fans, and by [[Aeolian processes#Deposition|wind-borne deposits]].\n\nSoil mixing (pedoturbation) is often an important factor in soil formation. Pedoturbation includes [[vertisol|churning clays]], [[cryoturbation]], and [[bioturbation]]. Types of bioturbation include faunal pedoturbation (animal [[burrow]]ing), floral pedoturbation (root growth, [[windthrow|tree-uprootings]]), and fungal pedoturbation (mycelia growth). Pedoturbation transforms soils through destratification, mixing, and [[stonelayer|sorting]], as well as creating preferential flow paths for [[soil gas]] and [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrating water]]. The zone of active bioturbation is termed the [[soil biomantle]].\n\nSoil moisture content and water flow through the [[soil profile]] support [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of [[solute|soluble constituents]], and eluviation. [[eluvium|Eluviation]] is the translocation of [[colloid]] material, such as organic matter, clay and other mineral compounds. Transported constituents are deposited due to differences in soil moisture and soil chemistry, especially [[soil pH]] and [[redox potential]]. The interplay of removal and deposition results in contrasting soil horizons.\n\nKey soil forming processes especially important to macro-scale patterns of soil formation are:<ref name=Pidwirney2006>{{citation|author=Pidwirny, M.|year=2006|title=Soil Pedogenesis|series=Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition=2|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/10u.html}}</ref>\n* [[Laterite|Laterization]]\n* [[Podsolization]]\n* [[Calcification]]\n* [[Soil salinity|Salinization]]\n* [[Gleysol|Gleization]]\n\n==Examples==\nA variety of mechanisms contribute to soil formation, including [[siltation]], [[erosion]], [[overpressure]] and [[lake]] bed succession. A specific example of the evolution of soils in prehistoric lake beds is in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]s of the [[Kalahari Desert]], where change in an ancient river course led to millennia of salinity buildup and formation of [[calcrete]]s and [[silcrete]]s.<ref>C.

For example, three species of [[land snail]]s in the genus ''[[Euchondrus]]'' in the [[Negev desert]] are noted for eating [[lichen]]s growing under the surface [[limestone]] rocks and slabs ([[endolithic]] lichens).<ref name=\"Odling-Smee 2003\"/> They disrupt and eat the limestone.<ref name=\"Odling-Smee 2003\"/> Their grazing results in the [[weathering]] of the stones, and the subsequent formation of soil.<ref name=\"Odling-Smee 2003\">Odling-Smee F.

For example, the [[chernozem]]s of the North American tallgrass prairie have a humus fraction nearly half of which is charcoal. This outcome was not anticipated because the antecedent prairie [[fire ecology]] capable of producing these distinct deep rich black soils is not easily observed.<ref>{{citation |last1=Ponomarenko |first1=E.V. |last2=Anderson |first2=D.W. |title=Importance of charred organic matter in Black Chernozem soils of Saskatchewan |year=2001 |journal=Canadian Journal of Soil Science |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=285\u2013297 |quote= The present paradigm views humus as a system of heteropolycondensates, largely produced by the soil microflora, in varying associations with clay (Anderson 1979). Because this conceptual model, and simulation models rooted within the concept, do not accommodate a large char component, a considerable change in conceptual understanding (a paradigm shift) appears imminent.|doi=10.4141/S00-075 }}</ref>\n\n===Relief===\nThe location of a soil on a landscape can affect how the climatic processes impact it. \nThe [[geomorphic]] effects of relief and topography determine how soil is moved, distributed and retained within a watershed and across the landscape. \nSoil material is carried to lower elevations by water and with gravity. \nBottom lands and low lands that retain and accumulate deposited soil will be deeper and richer with organic matter than their comparable uplands.\n\nSoils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes, and soils on the slopes that [[Aspect (geography)|face]] the [[sun path|sun's path]] will be drier than soils on slopes that do not. \nTopography determines exposure to weather, fire, and other forces of man and nature. \nMineral accumulations, plant nutrients, type of vegetation, vegetation growth, erosion, and water drainage are dependent on topographic relief.\n\nRecurring patterns of topography result in toposequences or [[catena (soil)|soil catenas]]. \nThese patterns emerge from topographic differences in erosion, deposition, fertility, soil moisture, plant cover, other soil biology, fire-history, and exposure to the elements. \nThese same differences are important to understanding natural history and when managing the land resource.\n\n===Parent material===\nThe primary material from which soil is formed is called [[parent material]]. Soil parent material could be bedrock, organic material, an old soil surface, or a deposit from water, wind, glaciers, volcanoes, or material moving down a slope.\n\n===Time===\nAll of the above factors assert themselves over time, often thousands of years. [[Soil profile]]s continually change from weakly developed to well developed over time. [[Chronosequence]]s used in soil studies consist of sites that have developed over different periods of time with relatively small differences in other soil-forming factors. Such groups of sites are used to assess the influence of time as a factor in pedogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huggett |first1=R.J |title=Soil chronosequences, soil development, and soil evolution: a critical review |journal=Catena |date=1998 |volume=32 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=155\u2013172 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(98)00053-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Paleosol]]s are soils formed during previous soil forming conditions.\n\n==Soil forming processes==\nSoils develop from [[parent material]] by various [[weathering]] processes. [[Organic matter]] accumulation, [[decomposition]], and [[humus|humification]] are as critically important to soil formation as weathering. The zone of humification and weathering is termed the [[solum]].\n\n[[Soil acidification]] resulting from [[soil respiration]] supports [[weathering#chemical weathering|chemical weathering]]. Plants contribute to chemical weathering through root exudates.\n\nSoils can be enriched by deposition of [[sediment]]s on [[floodplain]]s and alluvial fans, and by [[Aeolian processes#Deposition|wind-borne deposits]].\n\nSoil mixing (pedoturbation) is often an important factor in soil formation. Pedoturbation includes [[vertisol|churning clays]], [[cryoturbation]], and [[bioturbation]]. Types of bioturbation include faunal pedoturbation (animal [[burrow]]ing), floral pedoturbation (root growth, [[windthrow|tree-uprootings]]), and fungal pedoturbation (mycelia growth). Pedoturbation transforms soils through destratification, mixing, and [[stonelayer|sorting]], as well as creating preferential flow paths for [[soil gas]] and [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrating water]]. The zone of active bioturbation is termed the [[soil biomantle]].\n\nSoil moisture content and water flow through the [[soil profile]] support [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of [[solute|soluble constituents]], and eluviation. [[eluvium|Eluviation]] is the translocation of [[colloid]] material, such as organic matter, clay and other mineral compounds. Transported constituents are deposited due to differences in soil moisture and soil chemistry, especially [[soil pH]] and [[redox potential]]. The interplay of removal and deposition results in contrasting soil horizons.\n\nKey soil forming processes especially important to macro-scale patterns of soil formation are:<ref name=Pidwirney2006>{{citation|author=Pidwirny, M.|year=2006|title=Soil Pedogenesis|series=Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition=2|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/10u.html}}</ref>\n* [[Laterite|Laterization]]\n* [[Podsolization]]\n* [[Calcification]]\n* [[Soil salinity|Salinization]]\n* [[Gleysol|Gleization]]\n\n==Examples==\nA variety of mechanisms contribute to soil formation, including [[siltation]], [[erosion]], [[overpressure]] and [[lake]] bed succession. A specific example of the evolution of soils in prehistoric lake beds is in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]s of the [[Kalahari Desert]], where change in an ancient river course led to millennia of salinity buildup and formation of [[calcrete]]s and [[silcrete]]s.<ref>C.
