Around the start of the 21st century, most residential access was by dial-up, while access from businesses was usually by higher speed connections. In subsequent years dial-up declined in favor of broadband access. Both types of access generally use a [[modem]], which converts [[digital data]] to [[analog signal|analog]] for transmission over a particular analog network (ex. the [[telephone]] or [[Cable television|cable]] networks).<ref name=\"howstuffworks\">[http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howbroadbandworks.html \"Broadband Internet\"], Chris Woodford, ''Explain that Stuff'', August 20, 2008. Retrieved on January 19, 2009.</ref>\n\n[[Dial-up]] access is a connection to the Internet through a phone line, creating a semi-permanent link to the Internet.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /> Operating on a single channel, it monopolizes the phone line and is the slowest method of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas because it requires no infrastructure other than the already existing telephone network. Dial-up connections typically do not exceed a speed of 56 [[kbit/s]], because they are primarily made via a [[56 kbit/s modem|56k modem]].<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /> Since the mid 2000s, this technology became obsolete in most developed countries.\n\nBroadband access includes a wide range of speeds and technologies, all of which provide much faster access to the Internet than dial-up. The term \"[[broadband]]\" once had a technical meaning, but today it is more often used as a marketing [[buzzword]] to simply mean \"faster\". Broadband connections are continuous or \"always on\" connections, without the need to dial and hangup, and do not monopolize phone lines.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /> Common types of broadband access include [[DSL]] (digital subscriber lines), [[cable Internet access]], [[satellite Internet access]], [[mobile broadband]] via cell phones and other mobile devices among many others. In 2015, the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) defined broadband as any connection with a download speed of at least 25 Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 3 Mbit/s, though the definition has used a slower speed in the past.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/01/29/the-fcc-has-set-a-new-faster-definition-for-broadband/ \"The FCC has set a new, faster definition for broadband\"], Brian Fung, ''The Washington Post'', January 29, 2015.

Wireless broadband subscriptions in the U.S. are primarily mobile-cellular broadband.

The Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As part of this decision, the Commission also refrains (or \"forbears\") from enforcing provisions of Title II that are not relevant to modern broadband service. Together Title II and Section 706 support clear rules of the road, providing the certainty needed for innovators and investors, and the competitive choices and freedom demanded by consumers.\n\nThe new rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service.

Over time this grew into the more general goal of providing telephone service to everyone in the United States at a reasonable price. When Congress passed the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] it provided for the creation of a Universal Service Fund to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established in 1997 by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to implement the goals of the Telecommunications Act.\n\nThe Telecommunications Act requires all telecommunications companies to make equitable and non-discriminatory contributions to the USF. Under the supervision of the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), is responsible for allocating money from the central fund to four programs: High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries (E-rate). These programs are designed to:<ref name=\"usf\">[http://newsatelliteservices.com/ \"New Satellite Services\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015204934/http://newsatelliteservices.com/ |date=2017-10-15 }}, Best Internet Deals Plans & Packages</ref>\n* Promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable, and affordable rates;\n* Increase access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the Nation;\n* Advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas;\n* Increase access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities; and\n* Provide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs.\n\nTelecommunications companies may, but are not required to, charge their customers a fee to recover the costs of contributing to the Universal Service fund. Consumers may see this reflected in a line-item charge labeled \u201cUniversal Service\" on telecommunications bills. The amount of this charge, if any, and the method used to collect the fee from consumers is determined by the companies and is not mandated by the FCC.<ref name=\"usf\" />\n\nIn October 2011 the FCC voted to phase out the USF's high-cost program that has been subsidizing voice telephone services in rural areas by shifting $4.5 billion a year in funding over several years to a new Connect America Fund focused on expanding broadband deployment.<ref name=PCWorld_1>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/242713/fcc_votes_to_end_telephone_subsidies_shift_to_broadband.html |title=FCC Votes to End Telephone Subsidies, Shift to Broadband |work=PC World |publisher=IDG News Service |author=Grant Gross |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=FCC_CAF1>{{cite web |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-11-161A1.pdf |title=Universal Service Reform: Establishing the Connect America Fund and Intercarrier Compensation Reform |work=FCC 11-161 Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (released November 18, 2011) |date=October 27, 2011 |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)====\n{{main|E-Rate}}\n\nMore formally known as the Schools and Libraries Program, the E-Rate is funded from the Universal Service Fund.

The discounts available range from 20% to 90% depending on the poverty level and urban/rural status of the communities where the schools and libraries are located.<ref>[http://www.usac.org/sl/about/getting-started/default.aspx \"Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate): Getting Started\"], Universal Services Administrative Company, retrieved September 1, 2013.</ref>\n\nThere has been a good deal of controversy surrounding the E-Rate, including legal challenges from states and telecommunications companies. The impact of the program is hard to measure, but at the beginning of 2005 over 100,000 schools had participated in the program. Annual requests for discounts are roughly three times the $2.25 billion that is available, so while all eligible schools and libraries receive some discounts, some do not receive all of the discounts to which they are entitled under the rules of the program.<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-109HPRT24466/html/CPRT-109HPRT24466.htm \"Waste, Fraud, and Abuse Concerns with the E-Rate Program\"], Staff Report, Adopted by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, 109th Congress, U.S. Government Printing Office 24-466, November 2005.

The Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As part of this decision, the Commission also refrains (or \"forbears\") from enforcing provisions of Title II that are not relevant to modern broadband service. Together Title II and Section 706 support clear rules of the road, providing the certainty needed for innovators and investors, and the competitive choices and freedom demanded by consumers.\n\nThe new rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service.

Over time this grew into the more general goal of providing telephone service to everyone in the United States at a reasonable price. When Congress passed the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] it provided for the creation of a Universal Service Fund to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established in 1997 by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to implement the goals of the Telecommunications Act.\n\nThe Telecommunications Act requires all telecommunications companies to make equitable and non-discriminatory contributions to the USF. Under the supervision of the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), is responsible for allocating money from the central fund to four programs: High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries (E-rate). These programs are designed to:<ref name=\"usf\">[http://newsatelliteservices.com/ \"New Satellite Services\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015204934/http://newsatelliteservices.com/ |date=2017-10-15 }}, Best Internet Deals Plans & Packages</ref>\n* Promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable, and affordable rates;\n* Increase access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the Nation;\n* Advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas;\n* Increase access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities; and\n* Provide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs.\n\nTelecommunications companies may, but are not required to, charge their customers a fee to recover the costs of contributing to the Universal Service fund. Consumers may see this reflected in a line-item charge labeled \u201cUniversal Service\" on telecommunications bills. The amount of this charge, if any, and the method used to collect the fee from consumers is determined by the companies and is not mandated by the FCC.<ref name=\"usf\" />\n\nIn October 2011 the FCC voted to phase out the USF's high-cost program that has been subsidizing voice telephone services in rural areas by shifting $4.5 billion a year in funding over several years to a new Connect America Fund focused on expanding broadband deployment.<ref name=PCWorld_1>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/242713/fcc_votes_to_end_telephone_subsidies_shift_to_broadband.html |title=FCC Votes to End Telephone Subsidies, Shift to Broadband |work=PC World |publisher=IDG News Service |author=Grant Gross |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=FCC_CAF1>{{cite web |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-11-161A1.pdf |title=Universal Service Reform: Establishing the Connect America Fund and Intercarrier Compensation Reform |work=FCC 11-161 Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (released November 18, 2011) |date=October 27, 2011 |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate)====\n{{main|E-Rate}}\n\nMore formally known as the Schools and Libraries Program, the E-Rate is funded from the Universal Service Fund. The E-Rate provides discounts to K-12 schools and libraries in the United States to reduce the cost of installing and maintaining telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections. The discounts available range from 20% to 90% depending on the poverty level and urban/rural status of the communities where the schools and libraries are located.<ref>[http://www.usac.org/sl/about/getting-started/default.aspx \"Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate): Getting Started\"], Universal Services Administrative Company, retrieved September 1, 2013.</ref>\n\nThere has been a good deal of controversy surrounding the E-Rate, including legal challenges from states and telecommunications companies. The impact of the program is hard to measure, but at the beginning of 2005 over 100,000 schools had participated in the program. Annual requests for discounts are roughly three times the $2.25 billion that is available, so while all eligible schools and libraries receive some discounts, some do not receive all of the discounts to which they are entitled under the rules of the program.<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-109HPRT24466/html/CPRT-109HPRT24466.htm \"Waste, Fraud, and Abuse Concerns with the E-Rate Program\"], Staff Report, Adopted by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, 109th Congress, U.S. Government Printing Office 24-466, November 2005.

It provides funding to eligible health care providers for telecommunications services, including broadband Internet access, necessary for the provision of health care. The goal of the program is to improve the quality of health care available to patients in rural communities by ensuring that eligible health care providers have access to affordable telecommunications services, most often to implement \u201ctele-health and tele-medicine\u201d services, typically a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities.<ref name=RHC>[http://www.universalservice.org/rhc/ \"Rural Health Care Program\"], Universal Service Administrative Company, retrieved September 1, 2013.</ref>\n\nOver $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program.<ref>[http://www.state.ia.us/government/com/util/telecom/rhcp.html \"Rural Health Care Program\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226113419/http://www.state.ia.us/government/com/util/telecom/rhcp.html |date=2012-02-26 }}, [[Iowa Utilities Board]].
