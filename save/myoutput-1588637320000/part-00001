The song has English language verses and an [[Irish language]] chorus, a style known as [[macaronic]].\n\nThe title ({{IPA-ga|\u0283u\u02d0l\u02b2 \u0259 \u027e\u02e0u\u02d0n\u02e0|pron}}) translates to \"go, my love\" (or variants):  ''si\u00fail'' is an imperative, literally translating to \"walk!\", ''a r\u00fan'' is a term of endearment.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the song is unclear. It has been suggested that the song refers to the \"[[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]\" of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. If it does, however, the original version has probably been lost. It is not uncommon that Irish songs were translated into English, with their chorus surviving in Irish, or being transformed into nonsense words (see [[Caleno custure me]]), but in most of these cases, some of the Irish version still survives. It is possible that the song was composed in the 1800s with the conscious intention of styling it after older songs.\n\nSome in Ireland{{who|date=September 2012}} say that after the British occupied the island, they gave Irish men the choice of either joining the army or being exiled forever.  In the American rendition of the song, the young man referred to in the song chooses the army.  In the Irish rendition, however, he chooses permanent exile.\nAs is common in folk music, many lyrical variants of the song exist. \n\n[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] refers to the song twice in his novel [[The Master of Ballantrae]] (1889). Referred to as \"the pathetic air of 'Shule Aroon'\", it is whistled by the Irish Jacobite exile Francis Burke and later sung by the Master of Ballantrae himself to impress his younger brother's wife. The Master describes it as \"very moving\" and describes it being sung by Jacobite exiles in France: \"it is a pathetic sight when a score of rough Irish ... get to this song; and you may see, by their falling tears, how it strikes home to them\". <ref>Stevenson, Robert Louis, The Master of Ballantrae (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), pp. 73, 95.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Ulysses (James Joyce)|Ulysses]]'', [[James Joyce]] had Stephen Dedalus sing the song to Leopold Bloom in Bloom's kitchen (as part of the Ithaca episode).  The song can be seen to signal or echo many of the grand themes of the book, referencing loss of language, usurpation, betrayal, loss of leadership and women selling themselves.  Bloom responds by singing a song in Hebrew.<ref>Joyce, James, Ulysses (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1968), p. 608</ref>\n\n\"[[Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier]]\"/\"Buttermilk Hill\" is a well-known American variant dating to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], sharing a common melody and similar lyrics.\n\n==Modern performance==\n{{Listen|filename=Kokia_-_Siuil A Ruin.ogg|title=\"Si\u00fail A R\u00fan\"|description=A sample of the Irish chorus, as performed by Japanese singer [[Kokia (singer)|Kokia]] on ''[[Fairy Dance: Kokia Meets Ireland]]'' (2008).|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n\"Si\u00fail a R\u00fan\" is one of the most widely sung songs in the Irish repertoire.
