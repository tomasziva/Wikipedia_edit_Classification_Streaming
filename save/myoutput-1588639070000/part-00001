The term ''zoophilia'' derives from the combination of two nouns in [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''\u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd''''' (''z\u1e53ion'', meaning \"animal\") and '''''\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03b1''''' (''[[wiktionary:-philia|philia]]'', meaning \"(fraternal) love\"). In general contemporary usage, the term ''zoophilia'' may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific [[paraphilia]] (''i.e.,'' the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners.

Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are {{As of|2005|lc=on}} in some doubt, having been ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).\n\nSimilar restrictions apply in Germany (see [[Zoophilia#Legal status|above]]). In [[New Zealand]] the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.\n\nThe potential use of media for [[pornographic movie]]s was seen from the start of the era of [[silent film]]. ''Polissons and Galipettes'' (re-released 2002 as \"[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]\") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 \u2013 1930.\n\nMaterial featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to its ease of production.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'', so-called [[Tijuana Bible]]s were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.<ref>An example digitized Tijuana Bible entitled ''The Pet'' from the 1960s is linked at [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&item=TB073&fullsize=0 tijuanabibles.org page link] (also see [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi/hzpi/u/HzSt031FT7pj.ctu7.2/hazel.cgi?action=detail&item=TB073&fullsize=1 full size] and [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SEARCH&SEARCH_SPEC=bestiality&SUBMIT_ACTION_SEARCH=Search search]).</ref>\nThe promotion of \"stars\" began with the Danish [[Bodil Joensen]], in the period of 1969\u201372, along with other porn actors such as the Americans [[Linda Lovelace]] (''Dogarama'', 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was \"[[Animal Farm (video)|Animal Farm]]\", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dark Side of Porn Season 2 (2006) - Documentary / TV-Show|url=http://crimedocumentary.com/dark-side-porn-season-2-2006/|website=Crimedocumentary.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref> The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.\n\nInto the 1980s, the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like \"Wilma\" and the \"Dutch Sisters\". In the 1980s, \"bestiality\" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and [[Marina Hedman]], manifested early in the softcore flick ''Bestialit\u00e0'' in 1976.\n\nToday, in [[Hungary]], where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces a number of films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as ''Topscore'' and ''Book & Film International'', and the [[genre]] has stars such as \"Hector\", a [[Great Dane|great dane]] dog starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers, including for example, Suzy Spark.<ref>[http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/suzyspark.html EuroBabeIndex.com], Suzy Spark</ref>\n\nIn Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} female models performing [[fellatio]] on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an [[AV idol]] known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV ''The Dog Game'' in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, ''[[24 Horas de Sexo Expl\u00edcito]]'' featured zoophilia.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see [[extreme pornography]]), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.<ref>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2086306_acts_of_depravity_found_on_dads_computer \u2018Acts of depravity\u2019 found on dad\u2019s computer], ''[[Reading Post]]'', 26 January 2011.</ref>\n\nPornography of this sort has become the business of certain [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] such as [[Jeremy Jaynes]] and owners of some fake [[Thumbnail gallery post|TGP]]s, who use the promise of \"extreme\" material as a bid for users' attention.\n\n==Health and safety==\n{{Main article|Zoonosis}}\nInfections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the [[semen]], vaginal fluids, [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[feces]] and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are [[Brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[toxocariasis]]. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. [[Allergy|Allergic reactions]] to animal semen may occur, including [[anaphylaxis]]. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.\n\n==Zoophiles==\n\n=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===\nThe love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] the word \"zoophilia\" is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it<ref name=\"CraigheadNemeroff2002\">{{cite book|editor1=W. Edward Craighead|editor2=Charles B.

The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to \"openly\" express their sexuality.<ref>Montclair, 1997, cited by Miletski, 1999, p .35.</ref> As with many other [[alternative lifestyle|alternate lifestyles]], broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in [[online community|networked social groups]] became more common at home and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Weinberg and Williams\">Weinberg and Williams</ref> Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together.<ref>Markoff, 1990.</ref> The popular newsgroup [[alt.sex|alt.sex.bestiality]], said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), \u2013 and reputedly started in humor<ref>Miletski p. 35.</ref> \u2013 along with personal [[bulletin board]]s and [[talker]]s, chief among them [[Sleepy's multiple worlds]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind<!-- Clarify: Of what kind? Of all internet groups? Or of zoophilia-related internet groups? --> in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and [[Internet Forum|internet forums]]. By around 1992\u20131994, the wide social net had evolved.<ref>Miletski (1999)</ref> This was initially centered around the above-mentioned [[newsgroup]], alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group.<ref>Milteski (1999), p. 35.</ref><ref>Andriette, 1996.</ref><ref>Fox, 1994.</ref><ref>Montclair, 1997.</ref> The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events.<ref>Donofrio, 1996.</ref>\n\nWeinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey's day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.<ref name=\"Weinberg and Williams\"/>\n\nWebsites aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth.<ref>Miletski (1999), p. 22.</ref>\n\nZoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form.<ref name=\"browplm2\">{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/2/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 News \u2013 Broward/Palm Beach \u2013 New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Debate over zoophilia or zoophilic relations ==\n[[File:Leda - after Michelangelo Buonarroti.jpg|thumb|[[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|''Leda and the Swan'']], copy of a lost Michelangelo.]]\n\nBecause of its controversial nature, people have developed arguments both for<ref name=\"singer01\">{{cite web|author=Pablo Stafforini |url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |title=Heavy Petting, by Peter Singer |publisher=Utilitarian.net |accessdate=13 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606173906/http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |archivedate=6 June 2012 }}</ref> and against<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopbestiality.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/bestiality-and-lack-of-consent/ |title=Bestiality and Lack of Consent \" StopBestiality |publisher=Stopbestiality.wordpress.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref> zoophilia.

The term ''zoophilia'' derives from the combination of two nouns in [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''\u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd''''' (''z\u1e53ion'', meaning \"animal\") and '''''\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03b1''''' (''[[wiktionary:-philia|philia]]'', meaning \"(fraternal) love\"). In general contemporary usage, the term ''zoophilia'' may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific [[paraphilia]] (''i.e.,'' the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners.

Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are {{As of|2005|lc=on}} in some doubt, having been ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).\n\nSimilar restrictions apply in Germany (see [[Zoophilia#Legal status|above]]). In [[New Zealand]] the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.\n\nThe potential use of media for [[pornographic movie]]s was seen from the start of the era of [[silent film]]. ''Polissons and Galipettes'' (re-released 2002 as \"[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]\") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 \u2013 1930.\n\nMaterial featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to its ease of production.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'', so-called [[Tijuana Bible]]s were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.<ref>An example digitized Tijuana Bible entitled ''The Pet'' from the 1960s is linked at [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&item=TB073&fullsize=0 tijuanabibles.org page link] (also see [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi/hzpi/u/HzSt031FT7pj.ctu7.2/hazel.cgi?action=detail&item=TB073&fullsize=1 full size] and [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SEARCH&SEARCH_SPEC=bestiality&SUBMIT_ACTION_SEARCH=Search search]).</ref>\nThe promotion of \"stars\" began with the Danish [[Bodil Joensen]], in the period of 1969\u201372, along with other porn actors such as the Americans [[Linda Lovelace]] (''Dogarama'', 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was \"[[Animal Farm (video)|Animal Farm]]\", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dark Side of Porn Season 2 (2006) - Documentary / TV-Show|url=http://crimedocumentary.com/dark-side-porn-season-2-2006/|website=Crimedocumentary.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref> The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.\n\nInto the 1980s, the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like \"Wilma\" and the \"Dutch Sisters\". In the 1980s, \"bestiality\" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and [[Marina Hedman]], manifested early in the softcore flick ''Bestialit\u00e0'' in 1976.\n\nToday, in [[Hungary]], where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces a number of films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as ''Topscore'' and ''Book & Film International'', and the [[genre]] has stars such as \"Hector\", a [[Great Dane|great dane]] dog starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers, including for example, Suzy Spark.<ref>[http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/suzyspark.html EuroBabeIndex.com], Suzy Spark</ref>\n\nIn Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} female models performing [[fellatio]] on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an [[AV idol]] known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV ''The Dog Game'' in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, ''[[24 Horas de Sexo Expl\u00edcito]]'' featured zoophilia.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see [[extreme pornography]]), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.<ref>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2086306_acts_of_depravity_found_on_dads_computer \u2018Acts of depravity\u2019 found on dad\u2019s computer], ''[[Reading Post]]'', 26 January 2011.</ref>\n\nPornography of this sort has become the business of certain [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] such as [[Jeremy Jaynes]] and owners of some fake [[Thumbnail gallery post|TGP]]s, who use the promise of \"extreme\" material as a bid for users' attention.\n\n==Health and safety==\n{{Main article|Zoonosis}}\nInfections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the [[semen]], vaginal fluids, [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[feces]] and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are [[Brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[toxocariasis]]. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. [[Allergy|Allergic reactions]] to animal semen may occur, including [[anaphylaxis]]. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.\n\n==Zoophiles==\n\n=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===\nThe love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] the word \"zoophilia\" is sometimes used without sexual implications.

The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to \"openly\" express their sexuality.<ref>Montclair, 1997, cited by Miletski, 1999, p .35.</ref> As with many other [[alternative lifestyle|alternate lifestyles]], broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in [[online community|networked social groups]] became more common at home and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Weinberg and Williams\">Weinberg and Williams</ref> Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together.<ref>Markoff, 1990.</ref> The popular newsgroup [[alt.sex|alt.sex.bestiality]], said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), \u2013 and reputedly started in humor<ref>Miletski p. 35.</ref> \u2013 along with personal [[bulletin board]]s and [[talker]]s, chief among them [[Sleepy's multiple worlds]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind<!-- Clarify: Of what kind?

These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and [[Internet Forum|internet forums]]. By around 1992\u20131994, the wide social net had evolved.<ref>Miletski (1999)</ref> This was initially centered around the above-mentioned [[newsgroup]], alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group.<ref>Milteski (1999), p. 35.</ref><ref>Andriette, 1996.</ref><ref>Fox, 1994.</ref><ref>Montclair, 1997.</ref> The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events.<ref>Donofrio, 1996.</ref>\n\nWeinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey's day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.<ref name=\"Weinberg and Williams\"/>\n\nWebsites aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized.
