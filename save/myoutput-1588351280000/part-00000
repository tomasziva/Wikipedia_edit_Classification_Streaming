{"title_page": "List of churches in the City of London", "text_new": "[[File:StPaulsCathedralSouth.jpg|thumb|[[St Paul's Cathedral]] viewed from near the Thames]]\nThis is a list of '''[[cathedral]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[chapel]]s''' in the [[City of London]]. The list focuses on the more permanent churches and buildings which identify themselves as places of Christian worship. The denominations appended are those by which they self-identify.\n\n==History==\n===Wren and Anglican churches===\nBefore the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, the [[City of London]] had around 100 churches in an area of only one square mile (2.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Of the 86 destroyed by the Fire, 51 were rebuilt along with [[St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>[[Roy Porter|Porter, Roy]] (1994) ''London: A Social History'', Cambridge: Harvard. pp.87\u201388</ref> The majority have traditionally been regarded as the work of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], but although their rebuilding was entrusted primarily to him, the role of his various associates, including [[Robert Hooke#Hooke the architect|Robert Hooke]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] especially, is currently being reassessed and given greater emphasis.<ref>Cooper, Michael (2003) ''A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London after the Great Fire''. Sutton Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7509-2959-6}}</ref><ref>[[Vaughan Hart|Hart, Vaughan]], ''Nicholas Hawksmoor: Rebuilding Ancient Wonders''. [[Yale University Press]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-300-09699-2}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, as opposed to Catholic churches, [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] chapels or meeting houses, the designs of the Wren office provided a new standard for British church architecture ever since,<ref name=Cragoe>{{cite web|last=Davidson Cragoe|first=Carol|title=Towards the Floodgates of Religious Reform|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/church_state/modern/floodgates_of_reform_09.shtml|work=History Trails: Church and State| publisher=[[BBC History]]|date=4 February 2005| accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>  as well as giving a distinctive face to the Anglican church in London.<ref>\"For my own part I view the work of Sir Christopher Wren as a beacon which never fails to inspire. And there is no finer monument of his genius than the character he gave to London,\" Sir Edwin Lutyens. From [http://www.london-city-churches.org.uk/ London City Churches]</ref> Wren also designed a number of Anglican churches outside the City, including [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's, Piccadilly]] and [[St Clement Danes]]. After the Wren era, Hawksmoor was responsible for six of the great Anglican churches in the [[East End of London]] (for example [[Christ Church, Spitalfields]]), and other architects such as Hooke, [[James Gibbs]] and [[John James (architect)|John James]] contributed significantly to Anglican church architecture in London.\n\n===Metropolitan area===\n[[File:Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right| The [[King's Weigh House]] building on Duke Street, Mayfair (designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and an example of nonconformist church architecture) today serves as the [[Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile]].]] London's churches and chapels are extraordinarily numerous and diverse. Anglican and nonconformist churches and chapels are most numerous, but there are also many [[Catholicism|Catholic]] churches as well as places of worship for non-[[Christianity|Christian]] religions.\n\nMost of the Anglican churches lie within the Anglican dioceses of [[Diocese of London|London]] to the north and [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]] to the south. For historical reasons, the Anglican churches in London north of the [[River Thames|Thames]] but east of the [[River Lea]] fall within the [[Diocese of Chelmsford]], and those in the London Boroughs of Bexley and Bromley fall within the [[Diocese of Rochester]]. A few Anglican churches in the Barnet area fall into the [[Diocese of St Albans]], reflecting the historical association of Barnet with Hertfordshire. The Catholic dioceses that cover Greater London are, north of the Thames and west of the Lea, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster|Diocese of Westminster]]; south of the Thames the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark|Archdiocese of Southwark]]; and north of the Thames and east of the Lea, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brentwood|Diocese of Brentwood]]. There are still some two thousand Anglican churches alone, across the capital and if nonconformist and other denominations are included, they cover every age and style, in the design and evolution of which at least six hundred different architects have made contributions. As London expanded during the early 19th century, many new churches and chapels were built independently by the growing nonconformist urban population; to match the growth in nonconformist churches and chapels, the Anglican \"[[Waterloo church]]\" building programme saw numerous Anglican churches constructed across south London in the first half of the century.\n\n===Significance===\nAlthough many churches and chapels were entirely or partly lost to 19th-century demolitions and to bombing in the [[Second World War]], many historic, architecturally significant and religiously significant buildings remain, particularly in the City of London and the neighbouring [[City of Westminster]]. A number of the churches are mentioned in the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Oranges and Lemons]]''. Churches in this list belong to various [[Christian denominations|denominations]], as indicated.\n\n==List of churches==\n<onlyinclude>\n{{Further2|[[:Category:Churches in the City of London|Churches in the City of London]]}}\nThe City of London is not a London borough, but while being a ceremonial county in its own right, is within [[Greater London]].\nIn 1666 there were 96 parishes within the bounds of the City. Today the following continue Christian witness in one form or another in the heart of London. A map can be found here:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simonknott.co.uk/citychurches/mainmap.htm|title=LONDON city churches|website=www.simonknott.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> The area has 46 churches for just 9,400 inhabitants; the ratio of one church to every 204 people is the highest in England, but the statistic disguises the fact that the vast majority of attendees at City churches live outside the area.\n\n===Medieval parish churches in the City===\nThis map shows the medieval churches in the City of London.\n{{Location map+|United Kingdom London City of London |caption =

The list focuses on the more permanent churches and buildings which identify themselves as places of Christian worship. The denominations appended are those by which they self-identify.\n\n==History==\n===Wren and Anglican churches===\nBefore the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, the [[City of London]] had around 100 churches in an area of only one square mile (2.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Of the 86 destroyed by the Fire, 51 were rebuilt along with [[St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>[[Roy Porter|Porter, Roy]] (1994) ''London: A Social History'', Cambridge: Harvard. pp.87\u201388</ref> The majority have traditionally been regarded as the work of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], but although their rebuilding was entrusted primarily to him, the role of his various associates, including [[Robert Hooke#Hooke the architect|Robert Hooke]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] especially, is currently being reassessed and given greater emphasis.<ref>Cooper, Michael (2003) ''A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London after the Great Fire''. Sutton Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7509-2959-6}}</ref><ref>[[Vaughan Hart|Hart, Vaughan]], ''Nicholas Hawksmoor: Rebuilding Ancient Wonders''.

And there is no finer monument of his genius than the character he gave to London,\" Sir Edwin Lutyens. From [http://www.london-city-churches.org.uk/ London City Churches]</ref> Wren also designed a number of Anglican churches outside the City, including [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's, Piccadilly]] and [[St Clement Danes]]. After the Wren era, Hawksmoor was responsible for six of the great Anglican churches in the [[East End of London]] (for example [[Christ Church, Spitalfields]]), and other architects such as Hooke, [[James Gibbs]] and [[John James (architect)|John James]] contributed significantly to Anglican church architecture in London.\n\n===Metropolitan area===\n[[File:Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right| The [[King's Weigh House]] building on Duke Street, Mayfair (designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and an example of nonconformist church architecture) today serves as the [[Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile]].]] London's churches and chapels are extraordinarily numerous and diverse. Anglican and nonconformist churches and chapels are most numerous, but there are also many [[Catholicism|Catholic]] churches as well as places of worship for non-[[Christianity|Christian]] religions.\n\nMost of the Anglican churches lie within the Anglican dioceses of [[Diocese of London|London]] to the north and [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]] to the south. For historical reasons, the Anglican churches in London north of the [[River Thames|Thames]] but east of the [[River Lea]] fall within the [[Diocese of Chelmsford]], and those in the London Boroughs of Bexley and Bromley fall within the [[Diocese of Rochester]]. A few Anglican churches in the Barnet area fall into the [[Diocese of St Albans]], reflecting the historical association of Barnet with Hertfordshire. The Catholic dioceses that cover Greater London are, north of the Thames and west of the Lea, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster|Diocese of Westminster]]; south of the Thames the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark|Archdiocese of Southwark]]; and north of the Thames and east of the Lea, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brentwood|Diocese of Brentwood]]. There are still some two thousand Anglican churches alone, across the capital and if nonconformist and other denominations are included, they cover every age and style, in the design and evolution of which at least six hundred different architects have made contributions. As London expanded during the early 19th century, many new churches and chapels were built independently by the growing nonconformist urban population; to match the growth in nonconformist churches and chapels, the Anglican \"[[Waterloo church]]\" building programme saw numerous Anglican churches constructed across south London in the first half of the century.\n\n===Significance===\nAlthough many churches and chapels were entirely or partly lost to 19th-century demolitions and to bombing in the [[Second World War]], many historic, architecturally significant and religiously significant buildings remain, particularly in the City of London and the neighbouring [[City of Westminster]]. A number of the churches are mentioned in the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Oranges and Lemons]]''. Churches in this list belong to various [[Christian denominations|denominations]], as indicated.\n\n==List of churches==\n<onlyinclude>\n{{Further2|[[:Category:Churches in the City of London|Churches in the City of London]]}}\nThe City of London is not a London borough, but while being a ceremonial county in its own right, is within [[Greater London]].\nIn 1666 there were 96 parishes within the bounds of the City. Today the following continue Christian witness in one form or another in the heart of London. A map can be found here:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simonknott.co.uk/citychurches/mainmap.htm|title=LONDON city churches|website=www.simonknott.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> The area has 46 churches for just 9,400 inhabitants; the ratio of one church to every 204 people is the highest in England, but the statistic disguises the fact that the vast majority of attendees at City churches
