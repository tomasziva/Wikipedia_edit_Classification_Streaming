It lies among the northern ranges of the [[Karancs Hills]] in its valley. Karancsalja is bordered by [[Karancsber\u00e9ny]] in the north, [[Karancslapujt\u0151]] in the west, [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] in the east and [[Etes]] in the south. It lies near the [[border]] between Hungary and [[Slovakia]]. \n\nKarancsalja has probably been inhabited since the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]], since its area - the northern side of the valley - is slightly raised from its surroundings, thus providing a suitable place for settlement.\n\nLike other settlements of the Karancs region, at the beginning of its history, Karancsalja was a typical village on a highway , and it was established along the road connecting the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] and the [[North Hungarian Mountains|Highlands]]. Until the middle of the 19th century, this was an important trade route for the county and even for the country. The traffic here was of considerable economic importance.\n\nDespite its favorable geographical conditions, Karancsalja did not become a large settlement, although in the second half of the [[19th century]], with the emergence and rapid development of mining, the village began to grow. More than 1400 people live in Karancsalja today.\n\n== Location ==\nThe village is located in the northeastern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]] county, in the valley of the Dobroda stream, in the valley of the Karancs Hills, five [[Kilometre|kilometres]] northwest of Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n.\n\nThe easiest way to reach Karancsalja is by Road 2206 (a side road of the [[Main road 21 (Hungary)|Dual carriageway 21]]) between [[Litke, Hungary|Litke]] and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, it is the first settlement from the [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n|county capital]].\n\nIt is also accessible from the Main road 22, from where one has to turn east-northeast in [[S\u00e1g\u00fajfalu]], to the 7 km-long Side road 22109 through Etes.\n\n[[Footpath|Footpaths]] and [[Forest road|forest tracks]] are available from the village to the [[Karancs Hills]].\u00a0\n\n== History==\nKarancsalja is a settlement of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian age]] in the valley of the Dobroda stream.\n\nIt was named after the 727 metres high [[Karancs]] peak, which is situated a few kilometres northeast of the village, on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, is also called \"[[Pal\u00f3c]] Olympus\".\n[[File:Szent Margit-k\u00e1polna (Karancsalja).jpg|left|thumb|258x258px|Margaret Chapel]]\nThe village already existed in the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian period]]. According to legend, in [[1241]] King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]] found refuge there one night when he had to flee after bloody [[battle of Mohi]] against the [[Tat\u00e1rj\u00e1r\u00e1s (disambiguation)|Tatars]]. Tradition holds that the King's daughter, [[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|St. Margaret]], built the Margaret Chapel on the summit of Karancs to commemorate this famous event.\n\nThe history of the village during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] and in the late [[History of Hungary#Medieval Hungary|medieval period]] is rather unexamined.\n\nIn [[1548]] it was owned by Ferenc Bebek.\n\nIn [[1715]], the census recorded 8, and in [[1720]], 14 Hungarian households.\n\nIn [[1770]] L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Jankovich, at the beginning of the [[19th century]] Antal Jankovics, and in the early 1900s G\u00e9za Balla were the most important landowners of the village.\n\nThe [[mansion]] in the village was built by Mikl\u00f3s Jankovich at the beginning of the [[19th century]], but was rebuilt by it\u2019s new owner in [[1909]] and demolished in the [[History of Hungary#Stalinist era (1949\u20131956)|1950s]]. The Roman Catholic church of the village was built in [[1886]].\n\nIn [[1873]] a large [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|cholera]] [[epidemic]] devastated the settlement.\n\nThe [[Coal mining|coal mines]] on the outskirts of Karancsalja were of great importance to the life of the population, providing a livelihood for many people in the [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century|20th centuries]]. At the end of [[1944]], the Karancslejt\u0151s mine at Etes, a few kilometres from the village, was the scene of a tragic event when seven of the miners who refused to work, in order to get better conditions, were shot dead.\u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karancsalja.hu/telepulesunk/ismerteto|title=Official website of the village Karancsalja|last=|first=|date=|website=www.karancsalja.hu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2001, 99% of the population of the [[Human settlement|settlement]] declared themselves to be [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and 1% [[Romani people|Romani]].\n\nAt the 2011 [[census]], 88.5% of the population said they were Hungarian, 2.9% Romani, 0.3% [[Germans of Hungary|German]], 0.3% [[Slovaks in Hungary|Slovak]] (11.5% did not answer; due to dual identities, the total may be more than 100%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/apps/hntr.telepules?p_lang=EN&p_id=18625|title=Detailed Gazetteer of Hungary|website=www.ksh.hu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe distribution of religion was as follows: [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] 47.4%, [[Calvinism|Reformed]] 1.9%, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] 0.8%, non-denominational 22.3% (25.6% did not answer).\n\n== The village today ==\n[[File:Karancsaljagp.jpg|thumb|279x279px|Karancsalja garden plots]]\nThe [[Public utility|infrastructure]] (water, gas, drainage, telephone, cable TV) is fully developed, the roads have been renovated.

In [[2003]], the sports field was renovated.\n\nA popular excursion destination is the \"Tavas\" recreation park, where cultural and sports programs are organized on public holidays. The most visited events in the village are the Village Day on the last Saturday of July, as well as the harvest parade and ball in early October.\n\nIn [[2015]], the Village Library opened in a new location.
