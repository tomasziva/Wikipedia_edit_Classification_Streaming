It is the culmination of a [[National Football League regular season|regular season]] that begins in the late summer of the previous year.\n\nThe game was created as part of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger agreement]] between the NFL and its rival the [[American Football League]] (AFL). It was agreed that the two champion teams would begin playing in an annual '''AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game''' until the merger officially began in 1970. The [[Super Bowl I|first game]] was played on January 15, 1967 after both leagues had completed their respective 1966 seasons. After the merger, each league was re-designated as a \"conference\", and the game has since been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL's league champion. The NFL restricts the use of its \"Super Bowl\" trademark, and it is frequently referred to as the \"big game\" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations.\n\nThe [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] have the most Super Bowl championship titles with six each. The Patriots have the most Super Bowl appearances with 11. The [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) and the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) are tied with 27 Super Bowl wins each.\n\nThe Super Bowl is the second-largest day for U.S. food consumption, after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]].<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite news|last=Karlsons|first=Donna|title=First Down Food Safety Tips for your Super Bowl Party|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2014/01/30/first-down-food-safety-tips-your-super-bowl-party|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]|date=January 30, 2014|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref> In addition, the Super Bowl has frequently been the most-watched American television broadcast of the year; the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Koba|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101367019|title=Super Bowl TV ratings: Fast facts at a glance|publisher=CNBC|date=January 28, 2014|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref> In 2015, [[Super Bowl XLIX]] became the most-watched American television program in history with an audience of 114.4 million viewers, the fifth time in six years that the game had set a record.<ref name=\"The Live Feed\">{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Super Bowl dethrones 'M*A*S*H,' sets all-time record|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/super-bowl-dethrones-mash-sets-53083|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211114725/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/super-bowl-dethrones-mash-sets-53083|archive-date=February 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Patra\">{{cite web|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Super Bowl XLIX is most-watched show in U.S. history|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000467823/article/super-bowl-xlix-is-mostwatched-show-in-us-history|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 2, 2015|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"variety20150202\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kissell|first1=Rick|title=Update: Super Bowl on NBC Draws Record U.S. Television Audience|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 2, 2015|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/ratings/super-bowl-ratings-hit-all-time-high-with-patriots-win-on-nbc-1201421267/|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref> The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world, and is second to the [[UEFA Champions League]] final as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|title=Elite clubs on Uefa gravy train as Super Bowl knocked off perch|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/elite-clubs-on-uefa-gravy-train-as-super-bowl-knocked-off-perch-1884429.html | location=London | work=The Independent|first=Nick|last=Harris|date=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Super Bowl commercials|Commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast]] is the most expensive of the year because of the high viewership, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast.

In 1960, the NFL encountered its most serious competitor when the [[American Football League]] (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. The original \"bowl game\" was the [[Rose Bowl Game]] in [[Pasadena, California]], which was first played in 1902 as the \"Tournament East\u2013West football game\" as part of the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] and moved to the new [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] in 1923. The stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the [[Yale Bowl]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The Tournament of Roses football game eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the [[Orange Bowl]]), New Orleans (the [[Sugar Bowl]]), and [[El Paso]] (the [[Sun Bowl]]) in 1935, and for [[Dallas]] (the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]]) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \"bowl\" for any major American football game was well established.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game, Super Bowl{{nbsp}}I.]]\n\nIn the mid-1960's, [[Lamar Hunt]], owner of the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]], first used the term \"Super Bowl\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.midwestsportsfans.com/2012/01/super-bowl-why-do-we-call-it-that-why-roman-numerals/ |title='Super Bowl' \u2013 Why Do We Call It That?

At the time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's [[New York Jets]] defeated the NFL's [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]] in Miami. One year later, the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the NFL's [[Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u20137 in [[Super Bowl IV]] in New Orleans, which was the final AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the [[Baltimore Colts]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Cleveland Browns]]) would constitute the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe winning team receives the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], named after the [[Vince Lombardi|coach]] of the [[Green Bay Packers]], who won the first two Super Bowl games and three of the five preceding [[History of National Football League Championship|NFL championships]] in 1961, 1962, and 1965. Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in [[Super Bowl V]] in Miami.\n\n==Date==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nSince 2002, the Super Bowl is currently played on the first Sunday in February. This is due to the current NFL schedule which consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately after [[Labor Day]] (the first Monday in September), the 17-week [[National Football League regular season|regular season]] (where teams each play 16 games and have one [[Bye (sports)|bye]]), the first three rounds of the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]], and the Super Bowl two weeks after the two Conference Championship Games. The Conference Championship Games are the third round of the playoffs. The week after the third round of the playoffs is when the [[Pro Bowl]] is played. The week after that, the Super Bowl is played. This schedule has been in effect since [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in February 2004. The date of the Super Bowl can thus be determined from the date of the preceding Labor Day. For example, Labor Day in 2015 occurred on September 7; therefore the next Super Bowl was scheduled exactly five months later on February 7, 2016.\n\nOriginally, the game took place in early to mid-January. For Super Bowl I there was only one round of playoffs: the pre-merger NFL and AFL Championship Games. The addition of two playoff rounds (first in 1967 and then in 1978), an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 (1978), and the establishment of one bye-week per team (1990) have caused the Super Bowl to be played later. Partially offsetting these season-lengthening effects, simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 1978, the season was started earlier. Prior to 1978, the season started as late as September 21. Now, since Labor Day is always the first Monday of September, September 13 is the latest possible date for the first full Sunday set of games (since 2002, the regular season has started with the [[National Football League Kickoff game|Kickoff Game]] on the first Thursday after Labor Day). The earliest possible season start date is September 7.\n\n==Game history==\n\n{{for|a full list of Super Bowl games and champions|List of Super Bowl champions}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:500px; text-align:center; margin-left:1em; float:right;\"\n|+Super Bowl records\n!

Fourteen other NFL franchises have won at least one Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots own the record for most Super Bowl appearances overall (eleven) and tied for the most won (six).\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Denver Broncos]] are tied for second with eight appearances apiece, achieving reaching that milestone in this respective order. Belichick [[Super Bowl ring#Most Super Bowl rings|owns the record]] for most Super Bowl wins (eight) and participation in any capacity (twelve, nine times as head coach, once as assistant head coach, and twice as defensive coordinator). [[Dan Reeves]] previously held the Super Bowl participation record in any capacity (nine, twice as a player, three times as assistant coach, and four times as head coach). Brady has the most Super Bowl starts (nine) and wins as a player (six), while [[Charles Haley]] has the second-most wins among players (five).\n\nEight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The [[Minnesota Vikings]] won the last NFL Championship before the merger but lost to the AFL champion [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in Super Bowl IV and became the first team to have appeared a record four times without a win. The [[Buffalo Bills]] played in a record four Super Bowls in a row but lost every one. The Patriots and [[Denver Broncos]] are tied for the most Super Bowl losses (five).\n\nFour teams (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], and [[Houston Texans]]) have never appeared in a Super Bowl. The Browns and Lions both won NFL Championships prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, while the Jaguars (1995) and Texans (2002) are both recent NFL expansion teams.\n\n===1960s: Early history and Packers dominance===\n\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] won the first two Super Bowls (known as the AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game for these first two contests), defeating the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Oakland Raiders]] following the {{nfly|1966}} and {{nfly|1967}} seasons, respectively. The Packers were led by quarterback, [[Bart Starr]], who was named the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP)]] for both games. These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in {{nfly|1961}}, {{nfly|1962}}, and {{nfly|1965}}, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the only [[threepeat]] in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967).\n\nIn [[Super Bowl III]], the AFL's [[New York Jets]] defeated the eighteen-point favorite [[Baltimore Colts]] of the NFL, 16\u20137. The Jets were led by quarterback [[Joe Namath]], who had famously guaranteed a Jets win prior to the game, and former Colts head coach [[Weeb Ewbank]], and their victory proved that the AFL was the NFL's competitive equal. This was reinforced the following year when the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the NFL's [[Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u20137 in [[Super Bowl IV]].\n\n===1970s: Dominant franchises===\n\nAfter the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] was completed in 1970, three franchises\u2014the [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]\u2014would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls in the decade.\n\nThe [[Baltimore Colts]], now a member of the [[American Football Conference|AFC]], would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in [[Super Bowl V]], a game which is notable as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] (Cowboys' linebacker [[Chuck Howley]]). Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's championship game.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 46 - Terry Bradshaw (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years.]]\n\nThe Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won [[Super Bowl VI]] over the Dolphins. However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss for over a year, as [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the next year]], the Dolphins would go 14\u20130 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games, capped off with a 14\u20137 victory in [[Super Bowl VII]], becoming the first and only team to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason. The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning [[Super Bowl VIII]] a year later.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Steelers became the first NFL dynasty of the post-merger era by winning four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl IX|IX]], [[Super Bowl X|X]], [[Super Bowl XIII|XIII]], and [[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]]) in six years. They were led by head coach [[Chuck Noll]], the play of offensive stars [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Franco Harris]], [[Lynn Swann]], [[John Stallworth]], and [[Mike Webster]], and their dominant \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense, led by [[Joe Greene (American football)|\"Mean\" Joe Greene]], [[L. C. Greenwood]], [[Ernie Holmes]], [[Mel Blount]], [[Jack Ham]], and [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]. The coaches and administrators also were part of the dynasty's greatness as evidenced by the team's \"final pieces\" being part of the famous [[1974 NFL Draft|1974 draft]]. The selections in that class have been considered the best by any pro franchise ever, as Pittsburgh selected four future Hall of Famers, the most for any team in any sport in a single draft. The Steelers were the first team to win three and then four Super Bowls and appeared in six [[AFC Championship Game]]s during the decade, making the playoffs in eight straight seasons. Nine players and three coaches and administrators on the team have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pittsburgh still remains the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice and four Super Bowls in a six-year period.\n\nThe Steelers' dynasty was interrupted only by the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[Super Bowl XI]] win and the Cowboys winning their second Super Bowl of the decade.\n\n===1981\u20131996: The NFC's winning streak===\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from [[Super Bowl XIX]] to [[Super Bowl XXXI]]. The NFC's winning streak was interrupted only when the [[Denver Broncos]] beat the [[Green Bay Packers]], 31\u201324 in [[Super Bowl XXXII]].\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The 49ers against the Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX]]\n\nThe most successful team of the 1980s was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], which featured the [[West Coast offense]] of Hall of Fame head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback [[Joe Montana]], Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], running back [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]], and defensive safety/cornerback [[Ronnie Lott]]. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade ([[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]], [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXIV|XXIV]]) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL.\n\nThe 1980s also produced the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], who posted an 18\u20131 record under head coach [[Mike Ditka]]; quarterback [[Jim McMahon]]; and Hall of Fame running back [[Walter Payton]]. Their team won [[Super Bowl XX]] in dominant fashion. The [[Washington Redskins]] and [[New York Giants]] were also top teams of this period; the Redskins won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]], [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]], and [[Super Bowl XXVI|XXVI]]. The Giants claimed Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXI|XXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]]. As in the 1970s, the [[Oakland Raiders]] were the only team to interrupt the Super Bowl dominance of other teams; they won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XV|XV]] and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]] (the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders).\n\nFollowing several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the [[Dallas Cowboys]] rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, the [[Buffalo Bills]] had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four. After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]], [[Super Bowl XXVIII|XXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXX|XXX]]) led by quarterback [[Troy Aikman]], running back [[Emmitt Smith]], and wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]]. All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who won their league-leading fifth title overall with [[Super Bowl XXIX]] with a dominant performance featuring the Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback [[Steve Young]], Hall of Fame wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], and Hall of Fame cornerback [[Deion Sanders]]; however, the Cowboys' victory in [[Super Bowl XXX]] the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with [[Deion Sanders|Sanders]] after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]]. The NFC's winning streak was continued by the [[Green Bay Packers]] led by Hall of Fame quarterback [[Brett Favre]], won [[Super Bowl XXXI]], their first championship since [[Super Bowl II]] in 1968.\n\n===1997\u20132009: AFC resurgence and the rise of the Patriots===\n\n[[Super Bowl XXXII]] saw quarterback [[John Elway]] and running back [[Terrell Davis]] lead the [[Denver Broncos]] to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak. The following year, the Broncos defeated the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game. The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams\u2014the Steelers, [[New England Patriots]], Broncos, [[Baltimore Ravens]], and [[Indianapolis Colts]]\u2014accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.\n[[File:Patriots on offense at Super Bowl XXXIX 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Patriots playing against the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX]]\n\nThe [[New England Patriots]] became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade. They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s [[Dallas Cowboys]]). In [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], first-year starting quarterback [[Tom Brady]] led his team to a 20\u201317 upset victory over the [[St. Louis Rams]]. Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deadspin.com/5981692/what-was-the-best-super-bowl-ever-ranking-all-47-games-according-to-watchability |title=What Was The Best Super Bowl Ever?

This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]' 48\u201321 [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] victory over the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Indianapolis Colts]] continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XL|XL]] and [[Super Bowl XLI|XLI]] in 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, respectively defeating the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Chicago Bears]].\n\nIn the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16\u20130. They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in [[Super Bowl XLII]]. However, they lost that game to [[Eli Manning]] and the [[New York Giants]] 17\u201314, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18\u20131.\n\nThe following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title ([[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]]) in a 27\u201323, final-minute victory against the [[Arizona Cardinals]].\n\nThe 2009 season saw the [[New Orleans Saints]] defeat the Indianapolis Colts in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] by a score of 31\u201317 to take home their first Championship. With this victory, the Saints joined the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[New York Jets]] as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance.\n\n===2010\u20132019: The Patriots' second run; parity in the NFC===\n\nIn the AFC, this era was dominated by the [[New England Patriots]], with the only three other teams to represent the conference being the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Denver Broncos]] and Baltimore Ravens. The Super Bowls of the late 2000s and 2010s are notable for the performances (and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks, especially on the AFC side in repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, [[Tom Brady]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]], or [[Peyton Manning]] appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls between 2001 and 2018. Conversely, the only NFC teams to make the Super Bowl twice in this era were the [[Seattle Seahawks]], led by quarterback [[Russell Wilson]], and the [[New York Giants]], led by quarterback [[Eli Manning]].\n\nOne of these teams was featured in the culmination of the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], [[Super Bowl XLV]], which brought the [[Green Bay Packers]] their fourth Super Bowl victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in February 2011. This became [[Aaron Rodgers]]' only Super Bowl victory. The following year, in [[Super Bowl XLVI]], the Patriots made their first appearance of the decade, a position where they would become a mainstay. The Patriots, however, lost to the [[Eli Manning]] led [[New York Giants]], 21\u201317, who had beaten the Patriots four years before. This was the Giants 4th Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XLVII]], the NFC's [[San Francisco 49ers]] were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens 34\u201331. The game had been dubbed as the 'Harbaugh Bowl' in the weeks leading up to the game, due to the fact that the coaches of the two teams, [[John Harbaugh]] and [[Jim Harbaugh]], are brothers. During the 3rd quarter, the Ravens had a commanding 28\u20136 lead. However, there was a [[Power outage|blackout]] in New Orleans, where the game was being played. The game was delayed for 34 minutes, and after play resumed, San Francisco stormed back with 17 straight points, but still lost. [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], played at [[New Jersey]]'s [[MetLife Stadium]] in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold weather environment. The [[Seattle Seahawks]] won their first NFL title with a 43\u20138 defeat of the Denver Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XLIX]], the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, by a score of 28\u201324. Down by 10, the Patriots hosted a late 4th quarter comeback to win the game with [[Tom Brady]] scoring two touchdowns in the 4th quarter. In a key play in the final seconds of the game, then rookie free agent [[Malcolm Butler]] would intercept a pass by [[Russell Wilson]] at the one yard line, allowing the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game. \n[[Tom Brady]] was awarded his 3rd Super Bowl MVP, tying [[Joe Montana]] for the most Super Bowl MVP awards.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl 50]], the first Super Bowl to be branded with [[Arabic numerals]], the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the [[Carolina Panthers]], who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback [[Peyton Manning]]'s career. [[Von Miller]] dominated, totaling 2.5 sacks and forcing two [[Cam Newton]] fumbles; both fumbles leading to Broncos touchdowns.\n\n[[File:Tom_Brady_with_Vince_Lombardi_trophy.jpg|thumb|right|The Patriots post game speech after Super Bowl LI]]\n\nIn [[Super Bowl LI]], the first Super Bowl to end in overtime, the [[Atlanta Falcons]] led 28\u20133 late in the third quarter; however, they squandered the lead as the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] would tie the game 28\u201328 on back to back touchdowns and two point conversions. The [[Atlanta Falcons]] lost to the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] 34\u201328 in overtime. This 25 point deficit would be the largest comeback win for any team in a Super Bowl, breaking the previous of a 10 point deficit to comeback and win. The [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] never held the lead until the game winning touchdown in overtime. [[Tom Brady]] was awarded his record fourth Super Bowl MVP and 5th win as a Super Bowl Champion, throwing a then record 466 yards for 43 completions.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl LII]], the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] defeated the defending Super Bowl Champion Patriots 41\u201333. [[Nick Foles]] won the Super Bowl MVP. The Patriots totaled 613 yards in defeat, with [[Tom Brady]] breaking his previous Superbowl record of 466 passing yards with an all time playoff record 505 passing yards in the high scoring game; while the Eagles would gain 538 yards in victory. The Patriots' 33 points was the highest losing score in Super Bowl history. The combined total of 1,151 yards of offense for both teams broke an NFL record (for any game) that had stood for nearly seven decades. It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance, and their first win in franchise history. \n\nWhile Super Bowl LII produced the second highest-scoring Super Bowl, the following year's [[Super Bowl LIII]] became the lowest-scoring Super Bowl. The Patriots defeated the [[Los Angeles Rams]], 13\u20133. [[Tom Brady]] would receive a record sixth Super Bowl championship, the most of any player in NFL history, surpassing his tie with [[Charles Haley]] for five wins. Brady would also become the oldest player to ever win a Super Bowl at age 41, while [[Bill Belichick]] would be the oldest coach to ever win a Super Bowl at age 66. Wide receiver [[Julian Edelman]] was named Super Bowl MVP.\n\n=== 2020s ===\nIn [[Super Bowl LIV]] the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in an end-game comeback, 31\u201320. This victory marked the first time since 1991 that the NFC did not have more Super Bowl victories than AFC (tied at 25 wins each). The NFL and AFL both won two prior to the merger, since the NFC/AFC did not exist in the first four Super Bowls.\n\n==Television coverage and ratings==\n\n{{main|Super Bowl television ratings}}\n{{see also|List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States}}\n[[File:SuperBowlXXXVBroadcastCompound.jpg|thumb|The [[Super Bowl XXXV]] broadcasting compound, full of [[satellite truck]]s]]\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.<ref name=\"Viewership\"/> The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the [[UEFA Champions League]] final.<ref name=\"Viewership\">{{cite news|title=Champions League final tops Super Bowl for TV market|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8490351.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=January 31, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2017 }}</ref> For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most watched United States originating television program of the year.<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/216526/super-bowl-us-tv-viewership/ Statistics on Super Bowl TV Viewership in the US], Nielsen Media Research, February 2013.

The [[Louisiana Superdome]] has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue. The [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] was the only [[American Football League|AFL]] stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting [[Super Bowl II|Super Bowls II]] and [[Super Bowl III|III]].\n\nSeven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after [[Super Bowl XXVII]]'s host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl. Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]] (the [[Houston Oilers]] had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the [[Astrodome]] several years prior to [[Super Bowl VIII]]) and [[Stanford Stadium]]. Starting with the selection of the [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy#Aftermath and legacy|demanding public money or relocating]] to play in new stadiums.\n\nNo team has ever played the [[Super Bowl curse#The Home Field Advantage Curse|Super Bowl in its home stadium]]. The closest any team has come was the [[2017 Minnesota Vikings season|2017 Minnesota Vikings]], who were within one win of playing [[Super Bowl LII]] in [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], but lost the NFC Championship game to the Philadelphia Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the [[Minneapolis Miracle|Vikings won]]); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games. Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market: the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who won [[Super Bowl XIX]] in [[Stanford Stadium]] instead of [[Candlestick Park]]; and the [[Los Angeles Rams]], who lost [[Super Bowl XIV]] in the Rose Bowl instead of [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], during the time when league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).\n\nTraditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.<ref name=\"site\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Earnheardt |first=Adam C. |author-link=Adam Earnheardt |editor1-last=Swayne |editor1-first=Linda E. |editor2-last=Dodds |editor2-first=Mark |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sports Management and Marketing |title=Super Bowl |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TjDiwwaN5VsC|page=1509}} |date=2011 |publisher=Sage Publications |volume=4 |isbn=978-1412973823 |pages=1508\u20131511}}</ref> Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the [[Metro Detroit|Detroit area]]\u2014[[Super Bowl XVI]] at [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] and [[Super Bowl XL]] at [[Ford Field]] in Detroit, two in [[Minneapolis]]\u2014[[Super Bowl XXVI]] at the [[Hubert H.

[[Super Bowl XXXIII]] was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through, the game was moved to [[Hard Rock Stadium|Pro Player Stadium]] in greater Miami. [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, when that stadium failed to be built, the game was moved to [[SDCCU Stadium|Qualcomm Stadium]] in [[San Diego]]. [[Super Bowl XLIV]], slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from [[New York City]]'s proposed [[West Side Stadium]], because the city, [[New York (state)|state]], and proposed tenants [[New York Jets]] could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]. [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015 was originally given to [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with [[Kaufmann Stadium]] critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.<ref name=\"espn\">{{cite news | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2458407 | title = No rolling roof, no Super Bowl at Arrowhead | publisher = ESPN | agency = Associated Press | accessdate =January 15, 2007 | date = May 25, 2006 | authorlink = Associated Press}}</ref> Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to [[State Farm Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]].\n\n===Selection process===\n\nThe location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years prior to the event.

There must be a minimum of 35,000 parking spaces within one mile of the stadium.\n* The host stadium must have space for the Gameday Experience, a large pregame entertainment area, within walking distance of the stadium.\n* The host city must have space for the NFL Experience, the interactive football theme park which is operated the week prior to the Super Bowl. An indoor venue for the event must have a minimum of 850,000 square feet, and an outdoor venue must have a minimum of a million square feet. Additionally, there must be space nearby for the Media Center, and space for all other events involved in the Super Bowl week, including golf courses and bowling alleys.\n* The necessary infrastructure must be in place around the stadium and other Super Bowl facilities, including parking, security, electrical needs, media needs, communication needs, and transportation needs.\n* There must be a minimum number of hotel spaces within one hour's drive of the stadium equaling 35% of the stadium's capacity, along with hotels for the teams, officials, media, and other dignitaries.

Originally, the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for [[Super Bowl V]]. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been six (6) exceptions: the Dallas Cowboys during [[Super Bowl XIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]], the [[Washington Redskins]] during [[Super Bowl XVII]], the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] during [[Super Bowl XL]], the [[Denver Broncos]] during [[Super Bowl 50]], and the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl LII]]. The Cowboys, since {{nfly|1964}}, have worn white jerseys at home. The Redskins wore white at home under coach [[Joe Gibbs]] starting in {{nfly|1981}} through {{nfly|1992}}, continued by [[Richie Petitbon]] and [[Norv Turner]] through {{nfly|2000}}, then again when Gibbs returned from {{nfly|2004}} through {{nfly|2007}}.

It was agreed that the two champion teams would begin playing in an annual '''AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game''' until the merger officially began in 1970. The [[Super Bowl I|first game]] was played on January 15, 1967 after both leagues had completed their respective 1966 seasons. After the merger, each league was re-designated as a \"conference\", and the game has since been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL's league champion. The NFL restricts the use of its \"Super Bowl\" trademark, and it is frequently referred to as the \"big game\" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations.\n\nThe [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] have the most Super Bowl championship titles with six each.

In 1960, the NFL encountered its most serious competitor when the [[American Football League]] (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. The original \"bowl game\" was the [[Rose Bowl Game]] in [[Pasadena, California]], which was first played in 1902 as the \"Tournament East\u2013West football game\" as part of the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] and moved to the new [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] in 1923. The stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the [[Yale Bowl]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The Tournament of Roses football game eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the [[Orange Bowl]]), New Orleans (the [[Sugar Bowl]]), and [[El Paso]] (the [[Sun Bowl]]) in 1935, and for [[Dallas]] (the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]]) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \"bowl\" for any major American football game was well established.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game, Super Bowl{{nbsp}}I.]]\n\nIn the mid-1960's, [[Lamar Hunt]], owner of the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]], first used the term \"Super Bowl\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.midwestsportsfans.com/2012/01/super-bowl-why-do-we-call-it-that-why-roman-numerals/ |title='Super Bowl' \u2013 Why Do We Call It That?

At the time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's [[New York Jets]] defeated the NFL's [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]] in Miami. One year later, the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the NFL's [[Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u20137 in [[Super Bowl IV]] in New Orleans, which was the final AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the [[Baltimore Colts]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Cleveland Browns]]) would constitute the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe winning team receives the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], named after the [[Vince Lombardi|coach]] of the [[Green Bay Packers]], who won the first two Super Bowl games and three of the five preceding [[History of National Football League Championship|NFL championships]] in 1961, 1962, and 1965. Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in [[Super Bowl V]] in Miami.\n\n==Date==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nSince 2002, the Super Bowl is currently played on the first Sunday in February. This is due to the current NFL schedule which consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately after [[Labor Day]] (the first Monday in September), the 17-week [[National Football League regular season|regular season]] (where teams each play 16 games and have one [[Bye (sports)|bye]]), the first three rounds of the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]], and the Super Bowl two weeks after the two Conference Championship Games. The Conference Championship Games are the third round of the playoffs. The week after the third round of the playoffs is when the [[Pro Bowl]] is played. The week after that, the Super Bowl is played. This schedule has been in effect since [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in February 2004. The date of the Super Bowl can thus be determined from the date of the preceding Labor Day. For example, Labor Day in 2015 occurred on September 7; therefore the next Super Bowl was scheduled exactly five months later on February 7, 2016.\n\nOriginally, the game took place in early to mid-January. For Super Bowl I there was only one round of playoffs: the pre-merger NFL and AFL Championship Games. The addition of two playoff rounds (first in 1967 and then in 1978), an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 (1978), and the establishment of one bye-week per team (1990) have caused the Super Bowl to be played later. Partially offsetting these season-lengthening effects, simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 1978, the season was started earlier. Prior to 1978, the season started as late as September 21. Now, since Labor Day is always the first Monday of September, September 13 is the latest possible date for the first full Sunday set of games (since 2002, the regular season has started with the [[National Football League Kickoff game|Kickoff Game]] on the first Thursday after Labor Day).

Fourteen other NFL franchises have won at least one Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots own the record for most Super Bowl appearances overall (eleven) and tied for the most won (six).\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Denver Broncos]] are tied for second with eight appearances apiece, achieving reaching that milestone in this respective order. Belichick [[Super Bowl ring#Most Super Bowl rings|owns the record]] for most Super Bowl wins (eight) and participation in any capacity (twelve, nine times as head coach, once as assistant head coach, and twice as defensive coordinator). [[Dan Reeves]] previously held the Super Bowl participation record in any capacity (nine, twice as a player, three times as assistant coach, and four times as head coach). Brady has the most Super Bowl starts (nine) and wins as a player (six), while [[Charles Haley]] has the second-most wins among players (five).\n\nEight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The [[Minnesota Vikings]] won the last NFL Championship before the merger but lost to the AFL champion [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in Super Bowl IV and became the first team to have appeared a record four times without a win. The [[Buffalo Bills]] played in a record four Super Bowls in a row but lost every one. The Patriots and [[Denver Broncos]] are tied for the most Super Bowl losses (five).\n\nFour teams (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], and [[Houston Texans]]) have never appeared in a Super Bowl. The Browns and Lions both won NFL Championships prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, while the Jaguars (1995) and Texans (2002) are both recent NFL expansion teams.\n\n===1960s: Early history and Packers dominance===\n\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] won the first two Super Bowls (known as the AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game for these first two contests), defeating the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Oakland Raiders]] following the {{nfly|1966}} and {{nfly|1967}} seasons, respectively. The Packers were led by quarterback, [[Bart Starr]], who was named the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP)]] for both games. These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in {{nfly|1961}}, {{nfly|1962}}, and {{nfly|1965}}, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the only [[threepeat]] in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967).\n\nIn [[Super Bowl III]], the AFL's [[New York Jets]] defeated the eighteen-point favorite [[Baltimore Colts]] of the NFL, 16\u20137. The Jets were led by quarterback [[Joe Namath]], who had famously guaranteed a Jets win prior to the game, and former Colts head coach [[Weeb Ewbank]], and their victory proved that the AFL was the NFL's competitive equal. This was reinforced the following year when the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the NFL's [[Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u20137 in [[Super Bowl IV]].\n\n===1970s: Dominant franchises===\n\nAfter the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] was completed in 1970, three franchises\u2014the [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]\u2014would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls in the decade.\n\nThe [[Baltimore Colts]], now a member of the [[American Football Conference|AFC]], would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in [[Super Bowl V]], a game which is notable as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] (Cowboys' linebacker [[Chuck Howley]]). Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's championship game.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 46 - Terry Bradshaw (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years.]]\n\nThe Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won [[Super Bowl VI]] over the Dolphins. However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss for over a year, as [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the next year]], the Dolphins would go 14\u20130 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games, capped off with a 14\u20137 victory in [[Super Bowl VII]], becoming the first and only team to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason. The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning [[Super Bowl VIII]] a year later.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Steelers became the first NFL dynasty of the post-merger era by winning four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl IX|IX]], [[Super Bowl X|X]], [[Super Bowl XIII|XIII]], and [[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]]) in six years. They were led by head coach [[Chuck Noll]], the play of offensive stars [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Franco Harris]], [[Lynn Swann]], [[John Stallworth]], and [[Mike Webster]], and their dominant \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense, led by [[Joe Greene (American football)|\"Mean\" Joe Greene]], [[L. C. Greenwood]], [[Ernie Holmes]], [[Mel Blount]], [[Jack Ham]], and [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]. The coaches and administrators also were part of the dynasty's greatness as evidenced by the team's \"final pieces\" being part of the famous [[1974 NFL Draft|1974 draft]]. The selections in that class have been considered the best by any pro franchise ever, as Pittsburgh selected four future Hall of Famers, the most for any team in any sport in a single draft. The Steelers were the first team to win three and then four Super Bowls and appeared in six [[AFC Championship Game]]s during the decade, making the playoffs in eight straight seasons. Nine players and three coaches and administrators on the team have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pittsburgh still remains the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice and four Super Bowls in a six-year period.\n\nThe Steelers' dynasty was interrupted only by the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[Super Bowl XI]] win and the Cowboys winning their second Super Bowl of the decade.\n\n===1981\u20131996: The NFC's winning streak===\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from [[Super Bowl XIX]] to [[Super Bowl XXXI]]. The NFC's winning streak was interrupted only when the [[Denver Broncos]] beat the [[Green Bay Packers]], 31\u201324 in [[Super Bowl XXXII]].\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The 49ers against the Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX]]\n\nThe most successful team of the 1980s was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], which featured the [[West Coast offense]] of Hall of Fame head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback [[Joe Montana]], Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], running back [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]], and defensive safety/cornerback [[Ronnie Lott]]. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade ([[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]], [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXIV|XXIV]]) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL.\n\nThe 1980s also produced the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], who posted an 18\u20131 record under head coach [[Mike Ditka]]; quarterback [[Jim McMahon]]; and Hall of Fame running back [[Walter Payton]]. Their team won [[Super Bowl XX]] in dominant fashion. The [[Washington Redskins]] and [[New York Giants]] were also top teams of this period; the Redskins won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]], [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]], and [[Super Bowl XXVI|XXVI]]. The Giants claimed Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXI|XXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]]. As in the 1970s, the [[Oakland Raiders]] were the only team to interrupt the Super Bowl dominance of other teams; they won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XV|XV]] and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]] (the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders).\n\nFollowing several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the [[Dallas Cowboys]] rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, the [[Buffalo Bills]] had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four. After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]], [[Super Bowl XXVIII|XXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXX|XXX]]) led by quarterback [[Troy Aikman]], running back [[Emmitt Smith]], and wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]]. All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who won their league-leading fifth title overall with [[Super Bowl XXIX]] with a dominant performance featuring the Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback [[Steve Young]], Hall of Fame wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], and Hall of Fame cornerback [[Deion Sanders]]; however, the Cowboys' victory in [[Super Bowl XXX]] the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with [[Deion Sanders|Sanders]] after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]]. The NFC's winning streak was continued by the [[Green Bay Packers]] led by Hall of Fame quarterback [[Brett Favre]], won [[Super Bowl XXXI]], their first championship since [[Super Bowl II]] in 1968.\n\n===1997\u20132009: AFC resurgence and the rise of the Patriots===\n\n[[Super Bowl XXXII]] saw quarterback [[John Elway]] and running back [[Terrell Davis]] lead the [[Denver Broncos]] to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak. The following year, the Broncos defeated the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game. The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams\u2014the Steelers, [[New England Patriots]], Broncos, [[Baltimore Ravens]], and [[Indianapolis Colts]]\u2014accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.\n[[File:Patriots on offense at Super Bowl XXXIX 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Patriots playing against the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX]]\n\nThe [[New England Patriots]] became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade. They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s [[Dallas Cowboys]]). In [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], first-year starting quarterback [[Tom Brady]] led his team to a 20\u201317 upset victory over the [[St. Louis Rams]]. Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deadspin.com/5981692/what-was-the-best-super-bowl-ever-ranking-all-47-games-according-to-watchability |title=What Was The Best Super Bowl Ever?

This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]' 48\u201321 [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] victory over the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Indianapolis Colts]] continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XL|XL]] and [[Super Bowl XLI|XLI]] in 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, respectively defeating the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Chicago Bears]].\n\nIn the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16\u20130. They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in [[Super Bowl XLII]]. However, they lost that game to [[Eli Manning]] and the [[New York Giants]] 17\u201314, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18\u20131.\n\nThe following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title ([[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]]) in a 27\u201323, final-minute victory against the [[Arizona Cardinals]].\n\nThe 2009 season saw the [[New Orleans Saints]] defeat the Indianapolis Colts in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] by a score of 31\u201317 to take home their first Championship. With this victory, the Saints joined the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[New York Jets]] as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance.\n\n===2010\u20132019: The Patriots' second run; parity in the NFC===\n\nIn the AFC, this era was dominated by the [[New England Patriots]], with the only three other teams to represent the conference being the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Denver Broncos]] and Baltimore Ravens. The Super Bowls of the late 2000s and 2010s are notable for the performances (and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks, especially on the AFC side in repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, [[Tom Brady]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]], or [[Peyton Manning]] appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls between 2001 and 2018. Conversely, the only NFC teams to make the Super Bowl twice in this era were the [[Seattle Seahawks]], led by quarterback [[Russell Wilson]], and the [[New York Giants]], led by quarterback [[Eli Manning]].\n\nOne of these teams was featured in the culmination of the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], [[Super Bowl XLV]], which brought the [[Green Bay Packers]] their fourth Super Bowl victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in February 2011. This became [[Aaron Rodgers]]' only Super Bowl victory. The following year, in [[Super Bowl XLVI]], the Patriots made their first appearance of the decade, a position where they would become a mainstay. The Patriots, however, lost to the [[Eli Manning]] led [[New York Giants]], 21\u201317, who had beaten the Patriots four years before. This was the Giants 4th Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XLVII]], the NFC's [[San Francisco 49ers]] were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens 34\u201331. The game had been dubbed as the 'Harbaugh Bowl' in the weeks leading up to the game, due to the fact that the coaches of the two teams, [[John Harbaugh]] and [[Jim Harbaugh]], are brothers. During the 3rd quarter, the Ravens had a commanding 28\u20136 lead. However, there was a [[Power outage|blackout]] in New Orleans, where the game was being played. The game was delayed for 34 minutes, and after play resumed, San Francisco stormed back with 17 straight points, but still lost. [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], played at [[New Jersey]]'s [[MetLife Stadium]] in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold weather environment. The [[Seattle Seahawks]] won their first NFL title with a 43\u20138 defeat of the Denver Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XLIX]], the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, by a score of 28\u201324. Down by 10, the Patriots hosted a late 4th quarter comeback to win the game with [[Tom Brady]] scoring two touchdowns in the 4th quarter. In a key play in the final seconds of the game, then rookie free agent [[Malcolm Butler]] would intercept a pass by [[Russell Wilson]] at the one yard line, allowing the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game. \n[[Tom Brady]] was awarded his 3rd Super Bowl MVP, tying [[Joe Montana]] for the most Super Bowl MVP awards.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl 50]], the first Super Bowl to be branded with [[Arabic numerals]], the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the [[Carolina Panthers]], who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback [[Peyton Manning]]'s career. [[Von Miller]] dominated, totaling 2.5 sacks and forcing two [[Cam Newton]] fumbles; both fumbles leading to Broncos touchdowns.\n\n[[File:Tom_Brady_with_Vince_Lombardi_trophy.jpg|thumb|right|The Patriots post game speech after Super Bowl LI]]\n\nIn [[Super Bowl LI]], the first Super Bowl to end in overtime, the [[Atlanta Falcons]] led 28\u20133 late in the third quarter; however, they squandered the lead as the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] would tie the game 28\u201328 on back to back touchdowns and two point conversions. The [[Atlanta Falcons]] lost to the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] 34\u201328 in overtime. This 25 point deficit would be the largest comeback win for any team in a Super Bowl, breaking the previous of a 10 point deficit to comeback and win. The [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] never held the lead until the game winning touchdown in overtime. [[Tom Brady]] was awarded his record fourth Super Bowl MVP and 5th win as a Super Bowl Champion, throwing a then record 466 yards for 43 completions.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl LII]], the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] defeated the defending Super Bowl Champion Patriots 41\u201333. [[Nick Foles]] won the Super Bowl MVP. The Patriots totaled 613 yards in defeat, with [[Tom Brady]] breaking his previous Superbowl record of 466 passing yards with an all time playoff record 505 passing yards in the high scoring game; while the Eagles would gain 538 yards in victory. The Patriots' 33 points was the highest losing score in Super Bowl history. The combined total of 1,151 yards of offense for both teams broke an NFL record (for any game) that had stood for nearly seven decades. It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance, and their first win in franchise history. \n\nWhile Super Bowl LII produced the second highest-scoring Super Bowl, the following year's [[Super Bowl LIII]] became the lowest-scoring Super Bowl. The Patriots defeated the [[Los Angeles Rams]], 13\u20133. [[Tom Brady]] would receive a record sixth Super Bowl championship, the most of any player in NFL history, surpassing his tie with [[Charles Haley]] for five wins. Brady would also become the oldest player to ever win a Super Bowl at age 41, while [[Bill Belichick]] would be the oldest coach to ever win a Super Bowl at age 66. Wide receiver [[Julian Edelman]] was named Super Bowl MVP.\n\n=== 2020s ===\nIn [[Super Bowl LIV]] the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in an end-game comeback, 31\u201320. This victory marked the first time since 1991 that the NFC did not have more Super Bowl victories than AFC (tied at 25 wins each). The NFL and AFL both won two prior to the merger, since the NFC/AFC did not exist in the first four Super Bowls.\n\n==Television coverage and ratings==\n\n{{main|Super Bowl television ratings}}\n{{see also|List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States}}\n[[File:SuperBowlXXXVBroadcastCompound.jpg|thumb|The [[Super Bowl XXXV]] broadcasting compound, full of [[satellite truck]]s]]\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.<ref name=\"Viewership\"/> The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the [[UEFA Champions League]] final.<ref name=\"Viewership\">{{cite news|title=Champions League final tops Super Bowl for TV market|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8490351.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=January 31, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2017 }}</ref> For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most watched United States originating television program of the year.<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/216526/super-bowl-us-tv-viewership/ Statistics on Super Bowl TV Viewership in the US], Nielsen Media Research, February 2013.

The [[Louisiana Superdome]] has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue. The [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] was the only [[American Football League|AFL]] stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting [[Super Bowl II|Super Bowls II]] and [[Super Bowl III|III]].\n\nSeven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after [[Super Bowl XXVII]]'s host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl. Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]] (the [[Houston Oilers]] had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the [[Astrodome]] several years prior to [[Super Bowl VIII]]) and [[Stanford Stadium]]. Starting with the selection of the [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy#Aftermath and legacy|demanding public money or relocating]] to play in new stadiums.\n\nNo team has ever played the [[Super Bowl curse#The Home Field Advantage Curse|Super Bowl in its home stadium]]. The closest any team has come was the [[2017 Minnesota Vikings season|2017 Minnesota Vikings]], who were within one win of playing [[Super Bowl LII]] in [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], but lost the NFC Championship game to the Philadelphia Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the [[Minneapolis Miracle|Vikings won]]); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games. Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market: the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who won [[Super Bowl XIX]] in [[Stanford Stadium]] instead of [[Candlestick Park]]; and the [[Los Angeles Rams]], who lost [[Super Bowl XIV]] in the Rose Bowl instead of [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], during the time when league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).\n\nTraditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.<ref name=\"site\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Earnheardt |first=Adam C. |author-link=Adam Earnheardt |editor1-last=Swayne |editor1-first=Linda E. |editor2-last=Dodds |editor2-first=Mark |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sports Management and Marketing |title=Super Bowl |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TjDiwwaN5VsC|page=1509}} |date=2011 |publisher=Sage Publications |volume=4 |isbn=978-1412973823 |pages=1508\u20131511}}</ref> Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the [[Metro Detroit|Detroit area]]\u2014[[Super Bowl XVI]] at [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] and [[Super Bowl XL]] at [[Ford Field]] in Detroit, two in [[Minneapolis]]\u2014[[Super Bowl XXVI]] at the [[Hubert H.

Designated away teams have won 30 of 54 Super Bowls to date (approximately 56%).\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 09 - Mark Murphy (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] are one of six home teams that chose to wear the white jersey, shown here in [[Super Bowl XVII]].]]\n\nSince [[Super Bowl XIII]] in January 1979, the home team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white [[jersey (clothing)|jerseys]]. Originally, the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for [[Super Bowl V]]. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been six (6) exceptions: the Dallas Cowboys during [[Super Bowl XIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]], the [[Washington Redskins]] during [[Super Bowl XVII]], the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] during [[Super Bowl XL]], the [[Denver Broncos]] during [[Super Bowl 50]], and the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl LII]]. The Cowboys, since {{nfly|1964}}, have worn white jerseys at home. The Redskins wore white at home under coach [[Joe Gibbs]] starting in {{nfly|1981}} through {{nfly|1992}}, continued by [[Richie Petitbon]] and [[Norv Turner]] through {{nfly|2000}}, then again when Gibbs returned from {{nfly|2004}} through {{nfly|2007}}. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in {{nfly|1970}}, opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XX]]; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the {{nfly|1985}} season, but after winning road playoff games against the [[New York Jets]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to crimson for the Super Bowl as the designated home team.
