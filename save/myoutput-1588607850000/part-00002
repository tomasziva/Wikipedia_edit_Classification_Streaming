Celebrities and politicians whom he has imitated on more than one occasion include [[Barack Obama]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Donald Trump]], [[One Direction]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Kim Jong-il]], and [[Kim Jong-un]]. He often [[Auto-Tune]]s his vocals. Others who has he impersonated multiple times include [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. His music tends to make use of his several satirical alter egos similar to Detroit rapper [[Eminem]].\n\nHe has multiple alter egos, such as DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish) and Toby Queef (white American [[redneck]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Some critics have labeled Ali as a racist as a reaction to his songs, although his humour seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.<ref name=current/> His videos and YouTube channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17<ref>http://ruckasworld.com/</ref> YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations), but are [[Streisand effect|reuploaded by his fans]], who call themselves \"Rucka's Nuckas\".\n\nOne of his most infamous parodies was \"[[Ima Korean]]\", which was a parody of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' \"[[I Gotta Feeling]]\" which makes fun of [[Kim Jong-il]] and North Koreans. He later released a sequel called \"My Korea's Over I Think\" which is a parody of \"[[International Love]]\", taking place after Kim Jong-il's death in 2011, when his son [[Kim Jong-un]] took over as the leader of [[North Korea]]. In 2013, he released a third song in the series called \"Kim Jong-Un Song\" which is a parody of Florida Georgia Line's \"[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]\" featuring Balotelli, which is about the 2013 North Korean missile crisis.\n\nDuring the weeks July 31, 2010 through August 7, 2010, Ali held 5 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2010-07-31/comedy-digital-tracks |title=Comedy Digital Tracks : Jul 31, 2010 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |work=Billboard |date=July 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2010-08-07/comedy-digital-tracks |title=Comedy Digital Tracks : Aug 07, 2010 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |work=Billboard |date=August 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref> This feat had only been accomplished by comedy band The Lonely Island before Ali.\n\nRucka Rucka Ali has released six albums, three of which charted in the ''Billboard'' [[Top Comedy Albums]], ''[[I'm Black, You're White & These Are Clearly Parodies]]'' which peaked at No. 6<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2011-03-05/comedy-albums | title=Comedy Albums | work= Billboard | date=March 5, 2011 | accessdate=February 4, 2012}}</ref> and ''[[Probably Racist]]'' which peaked at No. 11.<ref>{{allmusic|class=artist|id=p2338024}}</ref> In September 2012, he released his sixth studio album, ''[[Rucka's World]]'', which peaked at No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' Top Comedy Albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rucka-rucka-ali-mn0002634782/awards |title=Rucka Rucka Ali &#124; Awards |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAli used to host a podcast named \"Rucka's Late Night Power Hour\" that ran from 2011 to 2012.

Celebrities and politicians whom he has imitated on more than one occasion include [[Barack Obama]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Donald Trump]], [[One Direction]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Kim Jong-il]], and [[Kim Jong-un]]. He often [[Auto-Tune]]s his vocals. Others who has he impersonated multiple times include [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. His music tends to make use of his several satirical alter egos similar to Detroit rapper [[Eminem]].\n\nHe has multiple alter egos, such as DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish) and Toby Queef (white American [[redneck]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Some critics have labeled Ali as a racist as a reaction to his songs, although his humour seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.<ref name=current/> His videos and YouTube channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17<ref>http://ruckasworld.com/</ref> YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations), but are [[Streisand effect|reuploaded by his fans]], who call themselves \"Rucka's Nuckas\".\n\nOne of his most infamous parodies was \"[[Ima Korean]]\", which was a parody of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' \"[[I Gotta Feeling]]\" which makes fun of [[Kim Jong-il]] and North Koreans. He later released a sequel called \"My Korea's Over I Think\" which is a parody of \"[[International Love]]\", taking place after Kim Jong-il's death in 2011, when his son [[Kim Jong-un]] took over as the leader of [[North Korea]]. In 2013, he released a third song in the series called \"Kim Jong-Un Song\" which is a parody of Florida Georgia Line's \"[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]\" featuring Balotelli, which is about the 2013 North Korean missile crisis.\n\nDuring the weeks July 31, 2010 through August 7, 2010, Ali held 5 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2010-07-31/comedy-digital-tracks |title=Comedy Digital Tracks : Jul 31, 2010 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |work=Billboard |date=July 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2010-08-07/comedy-digital-tracks |title=Comedy Digital Tracks : Aug 07, 2010 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |work=Billboard |date=August 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref> This feat had only been accomplished by comedy band The Lonely Island before Ali.\n\nRucka Rucka Ali has released six albums, three of which charted in the ''Billboard'' [[Top Comedy Albums]], ''[[I'm Black, You're White & These Are Clearly Parodies]]'' which peaked at No. 6<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2011-03-05/comedy-albums | title=Comedy Albums | work= Billboard | date=March 5, 2011 | accessdate=February 4, 2012}}</ref> and ''[[Probably Racist]]'' which peaked at No. 11.<ref>{{allmusic|class=artist|id=p2338024}}</ref> In September 2012, he released his sixth studio album, ''[[Rucka's World]]'', which peaked at No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' Top Comedy Albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rucka-rucka-ali-mn0002634782/awards |title=Rucka Rucka Ali &#124; Awards |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAli used to host a podcast named \"Rucka's Late Night Power Hour\" that ran from 2011 to 2012.
