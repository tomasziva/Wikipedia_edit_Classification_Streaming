The UST was established in 2003 by the [[Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning]] as the nation\u2019s graduate school specializing in science and engineering education and research. The UST runs only a graduate school. Creating the new driving force for growth would play a major role in leading national growth in the new century. The South Korean government established the UST to produce professionals in the field of combined technologies, thought of as one of the most important criteria for creating the driving force for South Korea's national growth. Today, UST continues to develop itself into a major research university.\n\n==Education advantages==\nUST established courses that allow students to build experience in research fields. Lab rotation is an example. UST encourage students to get hands-on experience by actively participating in the research by awarding credits as well as minimizing classroom lectures. UST provide opportunities to participate in projects conducted by other institutions or private companies. UST also adopted Lab rotation programs which enable students to gain relevant experience in various research fields. Students take liberal arts classes as prerequisite so they can be well-grounded as leaders in their given research field, and provide them with insight into society in general.\n\n==Special courses==\nThe universities offer special courses in technical business administration, technical economics, technical strategies, theories of research, planning, and management, venture start-ups, technical communication, technical writing, etc.\n\n==Majors==\nUST is a graduate program in science and technology taught in English run as a consortium by the advanced research institutes in Daejeon and throughout South Korea.\n\n===School of Science=== \n* Science of Measurement \n* Bio-molecular Science \n* Bio-Analytical Science \n* [[Functional genomics|Functional Genomics]] \n* Nano Surface Technology \n* [[Green Chemistry]] and [[Environmental Biotechnology]] \n* Polar Science \n* [[Nuclear Fusion]] \n* [[Astronomy]] and [[Space Science]] \n* Radiological Cancer Medicine \n* Medical Physics \n* Marine Environmental System Science \n* [[Neuroscience]] \n* [[Technology management|Technology Management and Policy]]\n\n===School of Engineering ===\n\n* Broadband Network Technology \n* Information Security Engineering \n* Mobile Communication & Digital Broadcasting Engineering \n* Computer Software & Engineering \n* E-BIZ Management \n* Electronic Counter Counter-Measure Communications Technology \n* ITS Engineering \n* Underwater Acoustic Communications \n* Information Network for Transportation Engineering \n* Information Science & Technology \n* [[Virtual engineering|Virtual Engineering]] \n* Grid and Supercomputing \n* HCI & [[Robotics]] \n* Geoinformatic Engineering \n* Electrical Equipment Information and Communications Engineering \n* Advanced Device Technology \n* Intelligent Robot Engineering \n* Biopotency/Toxicology Evaluation \n* [[Nanobiotechnology]] \n* [[Food Biotechnology]] \n* Korea Traditional Medicine and Biotechnology \n* Nanomaterials Science and Engineering \n* Electrical Functionality Material Engineering\n* Nano-Electronics \n* Micro Nano System Engineering \n* Nano-Mechatronics \n* Accelerator and Beam Nano Engineering \n* Water Resources and Environmental Engineering \n* Resources Recycling \n* Environmental System Engineering \n* Future Modern Traffic System Engineering \n* Energy and Power Conversion Engineering \n* Advanced Energy Technology \n* Energy System Engineering \n* Green Process and System Engineering \n* Measurement and Detection of Radiation \n* Laser and Plasma Engineering \n* Advanced Nuclear System Engineering \n* Quantum Energy Chemical Engineering \n* Petroleum Resources Technology \n* Aircraft System Engineering \n* Space Launch Vehicle System Engineering \n* Accurately Guided Vehicle System Engineering \n* Satellite Systems and Applications Engineering\n\n==Campuses==\n[[File:University_of_Science_and_Technology_(South_Korea)_dorm_at_the_Institute_for_Basic_Science.jpg|thumb|UST Dormitory at the Institute for Basic Science in Daejeon.]]\nUST has headquarters and following research institutions as campus.\n\n*University of Science and Technology (UST)\n*[[Korea Institute of Industrial Technology]] ([[Korea Institute of Industrial Technology|KITECH]])\n*[[Korea Institute of Science and Technology]] ([[Korea Institute of Science and Technology|KIST]])\n*Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute ([[ETRI]])\n*[[Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute]] (KERI)\n*[[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]] (KARI)\n*[[Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute]] ([[KAERI]])\n*[[Korea Basic Science Institute]] (KBSI)\n*[[Institute for Basic Science]] (IBS)\n*[[Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute]] (KASI)\n*Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB)\n*Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM)\n*[[Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology]] (KIOST)\n*[[Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT)]]\n*Korea Institute of Machinery & Material (KIMM)\n*Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI)\n*[[Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science]] (KRISS)\n*Korea Institute of Geoscience & Mineral Resources (KIGAM)\n*Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER)\n*[[Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety]] (KINS)\n*Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI)\n\n==Achievements and vision==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\nSince foundation 2004, UST has been the most qualified research institution in Korea and globally as well.
