The ensuing battle lasted until October 23, 2017 when Defense Secretary [[Delfin Lorenzana]] announced the ending of the battle.

However, it was abandoned later the same year when thousands of Maranao warriors [[investment (military)|invested]] the then-fortifying settlement, pressing the Spaniards hard and thus they returned to Iligan, having failed in their quest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iligan.gov.ph/about-iligan/history/during-spanish-times/ |title=During Spanish times |website=City of Iligan website |language=en-gb |access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> The Spaniards only returned to the area when they began the conquest of the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] in the late 19th century, only to be abandoned once again when the Americans came there in 1900. It served as the capital of the undivided [[Lanao (province)|Lanao province]] from 1907 to 1940. ''Dansalan'' in Meranaw is a place where ships berth \u2013 a port of entry.\n\nA Tribal leader of Marawi before Spanish colonization was \"Datu Buadi Sa Kayo\". He collected taxes in his era.\n\n=== Granting of charter (1940) and change of name to Marawi (1956) ===\nAccording to the late well-known Meranaw scholar Dr. Mamitua Saber, Marawi got its charter in 1940. The granting of a charter to the old Dansalan municipality was jointly conceived by the Philippine Commonwealth President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] and Assemblyman, later Senator, [[Tomas L. Cabili]]. The changing of the official name from Dansalan to Marawi was through Congressional amendment of the Charter in 1956 sponsored by Sen. {{ill|Domocao Alonto|nl}}.  This is embodied by Republic Act No. 1552 dated June 16, 1956.\n\nThe renaming of the city as \"Islamic City of Marawi\" was proposed by Parliamentary Bill No. 261 in the defunct [[Batasang Pambansa]], the former parliament of the Philippines during the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] regime, reportedly to attract funds from the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"ARMM\"/>\n\n=== 2017 Battle of Marawi ===\n{{Main|Battle of Marawi}}\nOn May 23, 2017, a pro\u2013[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] group called the [[Maute group]] attacked the city.

However, it was abandoned later the same year when thousands of Maranao warriors [[investment (military)|invested]] the then-fortifying settlement, pressing the Spaniards hard and thus they returned to Iligan, having failed in their quest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iligan.gov.ph/about-iligan/history/during-spanish-times/ |title=During Spanish times |website=City of Iligan website |language=en-gb |access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> The Spaniards only returned to the area when they began the conquest of the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] in the late 19th century, only to be abandoned once again when the Americans came there in 1900.

The granting of a charter to the old Dansalan municipality was jointly conceived by the Philippine Commonwealth President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] and Assemblyman, later Senator, [[Tomas L. Cabili]]. The changing of the official name from Dansalan to Marawi was through Congressional amendment of the Charter in 1956 sponsored by Sen. {{ill|Domocao Alonto|nl}}.  This is embodied by Republic Act No. 1552 dated June 16, 1956.\n\nThe renaming of the city as \"Islamic City of Marawi\" was proposed by Parliamentary Bill No. 261 in the defunct [[Batasang Pambansa]], the former parliament of the Philippines during the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] regime, reportedly to attract funds from the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"ARMM\"/>\n\n=== 2017 Battle of Marawi ===\n{{Main|Battle of Marawi}}\nOn May 23, 2017, a pro\u2013[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] group called the [[Maute group]] attacked the city.
