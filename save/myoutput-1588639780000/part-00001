He came to prominence in the late 1970s as co-founder and bass player of the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo]], which released a Top 20 hit in 1980 with the single \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\". Casale is one of the main composers of Devo's music and directed most of Devo's music videos.<ref name=AVClub>{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/article/devos-gerald-casale-42649|title=Devo's Gerald Casale|author=Adams, Sam|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=7 Jan 2016}}</ref> He is one of only two members (along with lead singer and keyboardist Mothersbaugh) who have been with Devo throughout its entire history. Casale's brother [[Bob Casale|Bob]] also performed with the band.\n\nCasale pursued a solo career in 2005 while still a member of Devo with the project [[Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers]]. The project received little promotion beyond a music video for the single \"Army Girls Gone Wild.\" Jihad Jerry performed at several shows near the end of Devo's 2006 tour, performing the song \"[[Beautiful World (Devo song)|Beautiful World]]\". He has also performed occasionally with other bands.\n\nCasale has also directed music videos for other recording artists, including [[The Cars]] (\"[[Touch and Go (The Cars song)|Touch and Go]]\"), [[Rush (band)|Rush]] (\"[[Mystic Rhythms]]\"), [[A Perfect Circle]] (\"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\"), [[Foo Fighters]] (\"[[I'll Stick Around]]\"), [[Soundgarden]] (\"[[Blow Up the Outside World]]\"), and [[Silverchair]] (\"[[Freak (Silverchair song)|Freak]]\" and \"[[Cemetery (Silverchair song)|Cemetery]]\"), among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mvdbase.com/person.php?id=C2452|title=Gerald Casale videography|accessdate=7 Jan 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGerald Vincent Pizzute was born on July 28, 1948, in [[Ravenna, Ohio]]. He was born with the last name Pizzute because his father, Bob, had legally changed his name (his birth name having been Robert Edward Casale) to that of his foster parents. Four years after Gerald's birth, his father changed his name back to his birth name. Gerald Casale grew up in [[Kent, Ohio]] and graduated from [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Kent, Ohio)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite news|title=DEVO's Seminal 1975 Night on Kent State's Front Campus|last=Prufer|first=Jason|url=http://kent.patch.com/blog_posts/devos-seminal-1975-night-on-kent-states-front-campus|work=Kent Patch|publisher=[[Patch Media]]|date=August 7, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907234505/http://kent.patch.com/groups/jason-prufers-blog/p/bp--devos-seminal-1975-night-on-kent-states-front-campus|archivedate=September 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===The Numbers Band===\nPrior to Devo, Casale had played bass guitar with [[the Numbers Band]].

Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Following the split, Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Silverchair]] and the [[Foo Fighters]].\n\nIn 2005, Devo recorded a new version of \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\" to be used in [[Swiffer]] television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted.

Their debut album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled ''DEV2.0'', was released on March 14, 2006.

He came to prominence in the late 1970s as co-founder and bass player of the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo]], which released a Top 20 hit in 1980 with the single \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\". Casale is one of the main composers of Devo's music and directed most of Devo's music videos.<ref name=AVClub>{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/article/devos-gerald-casale-42649|title=Devo's Gerald Casale|author=Adams, Sam|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=7 Jan 2016}}</ref> He is one of only two members (along with lead singer and keyboardist Mothersbaugh) who have been with Devo throughout its entire history. Casale's brother [[Bob Casale|Bob]] also performed with the band.\n\nCasale pursued a solo career in 2005 while still a member of Devo with the project [[Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers]]. The project received little promotion beyond a music video for the single \"Army Girls Gone Wild.\" Jihad Jerry performed at several shows near the end of Devo's 2006 tour, performing the song \"[[Beautiful World (Devo song)|Beautiful World]]\".

He was born with the last name Pizzute because his father, Bob, had legally changed his name (his birth name having been Robert Edward Casale) to that of his foster parents. Four years after Gerald's birth, his father changed his name back to his birth name.

Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Following the split, Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Silverchair]] and the [[Foo Fighters]].\n\nIn 2005, Devo recorded a new version of \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\" to be used in [[Swiffer]] television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted.

A full-length album, ''[[Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers#Mine Is Not a Holy War (2006)|Mine Is Not a Holy War]]'', was released on September 12, 2006, after a several-month delay. It featured mostly new material, plus re-recordings of four obscure Devo songs: \"I Need a Chick\" and \"I Been Refused\" (from ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume Two]]''), \"Find Out\" (which appeared on the single and EP of \"[[Peek-a-Boo!]]\" in 1982) and \"Beehive\" (which was recorded by the band in 1974, then apparently abandoned with the exception of one appearance at a special show in 2001).<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mine-is-not-a-holy-war-mw0000426610|author=Deming, Mark|title=Jihad Jerry and the Evildoers: Mine Is Not a Holy War|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nCasale directed several television commercials, including ads for Diet Coke and Honda Scooters featuring Devo, as well as for Coco's restaurants,<ref>{{citation  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dlk0hCTh5s|author=Coco's commercial with Brian Hamilton|title=Jacques the Maitre d'|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> and Miller Lite.

Among the most distinctive is a teardrop shaped bass, actually a [[Gibson Ripper]] with its horns sawed off and a thick arm padding added to the top side, as seen in videos for \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"Come Back Jonee\". From 1981 on, Casale has used a right-handed [[Steinberger]] L-series bass guitar, played upside down. He has played various keyboard basses, including a [[Minimoog]], a custom six-oscillator [[Moog Music|Moog]] keybass and a [[Roland D-50]]. Currently, Casale uses a [[Korg]] synthesizer for bass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myrareguitars.com/the-devo-guitar-guide|title=The Devo guitar guide|accessdate=6 Jan 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1970, he was a student at [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]], and was a witness to the 1970 [[Kent State Shootings]].
