It took six months of research prior to filming, as Yu wanted to create the big picture of the facts and threats of the water crisis in the domestic United States.\n\n''Last Call at the Oasis'' inspired Yu to direct her 2014 documentary ''Misconception'', which paints the population issues from a person-to-person point of view. While filming ''Last Call at the Oasis'' people questioned the purpose of acting on water conservation because they cannot control the population growth affecting it.
