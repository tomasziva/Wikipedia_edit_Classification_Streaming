On 14 April, a debate article was sent to Swedish newspapers signed by 22 academics, saying that the strategy of the Swedish public health agency would lead to \"chaos in the healthcare system\". Moreover, they said that there was no transparency regarding the data used in the models made by the agency. [[Anders Tegnell]] from the public health agency responded to the criticism by saying that there was no lack in transparency in the agency's work and that all data is available to be downloaded by the public as an excel-file on their website.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ann Linde: \"Forskare om Sveriges strategi: \"Kommer att bli kaos\"\" |url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=7451820 |website=www.sverigesradio.se |accessdate=14 April 2020 |language=sv}}</ref>  Additionally Tegnell stated that the numbers of deaths presented in the published article are wrong, especially regarding the specific number of deaths per day. Another claim in the article saying that Sweden's statistics were closing in to the ones of Italy was countered by Anders Tegnell saying that unlike Sweden, Italy and many other countries only report on deaths in hospitals, making it hard to compare the numbers of the different countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Tegnells svar p\u00e5 skarpa kritiken i DN-debatt: Grundl\u00e4ggande felaktigheter\" |url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/forskare-kritiska-til-fhm-lat-politikerna-ta-over |website=www.svt.se |accessdate=14 April 2020 |language=sv}}</ref>  In an interview with the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Tegnell stated his view on the closedown, lockdown, and closing borders imposed in other European countries &ndash; \"nothing has a historical scientific basis ...
