While it tends to carry a negative connotation in the Western world, the term \"propaganda\" broadly refers to any publication or campaign aimed at promoting a cause and is/was used for official purposes by most communist-oriented governments. Rooted in [[Marxism|Marxist thought]], the propaganda of communism is viewed by its proponents as the vehicle for spreading their idea of enlightenment of [[working class]] people and pulling them away from the propaganda of who they view to be their oppressors, that they claim reinforces exploitation, such as [[religion]] or [[consumerism]]. Communist propaganda therefore stands in opposition to bourgeois or [[capitalist propaganda]].\n\nA [[Bolshevik]] theoretician, [[Nikolai Bukharin]], in his ''[[The ABC of Communism]]'' wrote:<ref>[[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] ''The ABC of Communism'' (1969 translation: {{ISBN|0-14-040005-2}}), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/10.htm Chapter 10: Communism and Education]</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe State propaganda of communism becomes in the long run a means for the eradication of the last traces of bourgeois propaganda dating from the old r\u00e9gime; and it is a powerful instrument for the creation of a new ideology, of new modes of thought, of a new outlook on the world.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Theoretical origins==\n[[File:Happy people (7360943944).jpg|thumb|Happy people.

While all societies and civilizations have had their own unique history of development, they each pass through six distinctive stages of economic relationships sharing common characteristics, these being: [[primitive communism]] (hunter-gatherer societies), [[slavery]], [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], and finally a return to [[communism]] in a highly advanced form which is considered to be the epoch of humanity having become fully civilized.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Frederich|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific|date=1880|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm}}</ref>\n\nCommunist propaganda accordingly serves the same purpose as all its predecessor propaganda: to ideologically enforce the legitimacy of the working class (those who derive a living from selling their labor) as the ruling class of society. Within this context, the main counter-propaganda is ''bourgeois propaganda'', or propaganda that promotes the rule of the capitalist class (those who derive a living from privately owning property and capital assets). Communist propaganda is defined as a scientifically based system of the dissemination of the communist ideology with the purpose of education, training and organizing of the masses.\n\n==Purposes==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' identifies the following functions of communist propaganda:<ref>''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', [http://bse.sci-lib.com/article093385.html Propaganda] article</ref>\n*The link of the Communist Party with the [[working class]] and other working people<ref>In the communist and Soviet parlance the \"worker class\" is the class of industrial workers, while \"other working people\" includes other \"non-exploiting\" classes</ref>\n*Incorporation of [[scientific socialism]] into the worker movements and revolutionary activities of the masses\n*Unification and organization of national divisions of the workers', communist, and democratic movements\n*Coordination of the activities of the above-mentioned movements, exchange of information and experience\n*Expression of the [[public opinion]] of the working class, working people, their needs and interests\n*Spread opposition to the bourgeois and revisionist propaganda\n*Dissemination of statistical data about socialist society (i.e., the one of a [[communist state]]).\n\n==Targets==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nAs a common trait of any propaganda and its analogue, [[advertising]], communist propaganda's goals and techniques are tuned according to the target audience. The most broad classification of targets is:<ref name=clews>John C. Clews (1964) ''Communist Propaganda techniques'', printed in the USA by ''[[Frederick A. Praeger|Praeger]]'' and in Great Britain</ref>\n*Domestic propaganda of the communist states\n*External propaganda of the communist states\n*Propaganda of the communist supporters outside the communist states\n\nA more detailed classification of specific targets (workers, peasants, youth, women, etc.) may be found in the Communist Party documents, usually presented at the Congresses of the Communist Party.<ref name=clews/>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Use of Marxist ideology===\n{{Further|Marxism}}\n\nThe creation of the [[Soviet Union]] was presented as the most important turning event in human history, based on the Marxist theory of [[historical materialism]]. This theory identified [[means of production]] as chief determinants of the historical process. They led to the creation of [[social class]]es, and [[class struggle]] was the 'motor' of history. The [[sociocultural evolution]] of societies had to progress inevitably from [[slavery]], through [[feudalism]] and [[capitalism]] to communism. Furthermore, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] became the protagonist of history, as a \"vanguard of the working class\", according to development of this theory by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Hence the unlimited powers of the Communist Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the history itself.<ref name=\"Satter1\">[[David Satter]]. ''Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union'', [[Yale University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08705-5}}</ref> It also followed that a worldwide victory of [[communist countries]] is inevitable.\n\nClass struggle played a central role in the social policies of the USSR and socialist countries, all of which constitutionally outlined the [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|supremacy of the working class in dictating society's development]] towards communism. Other classes with interests hostile to those of the working class were subjected to repression. This primarily focused on capitalists, including anyone who derived their living from privately owning property or capital assets. In the USSR, which was founded on a class alliance between workers and peasants, a neo-capitalist class emerged by the 1930s as a result of the [[New Economic Policy]] introduced after the end of the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]]. Among the peasants, this new class (called Kulaks) accumulated disproportionately large amounts of wealth through merchant trading and small capital practices. Under [[Joseph Stalin]], the government began to [[Dekulakization|crack down on the Kulaks]], to which their resistance was met with violent repression in what could arguably considered a second civil war. Kulaks who resisted the socialization of their assets, along with anyone who collaborated with or fought for them, were punished with imprisonment, deportation to [[Siberia]], or even execution. [[Lev Kopelev]], who was personally involved in actions against villagers deprived of food for collaborating with Kulaks explained his motivation:<ref name=\"kulak\">\"Reflections on a ravaged century\", pages 93-95</ref>\n\n:\"It was excruciating to see and hear all this. And even worse to take part in it.... And I persuaded myself, explained to myself. I must not give in to debilitating pity. We were realizing [[Marx's theory of history|historical necessity]]. We were performing our [[Revolution|revolutionary duty]]. We were obtaining grain for our [[Socialism|socialist]] Fatherland. For the [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)|Five Year Plan]]. Our goal was the universal triumph of the [[Communism]], and for the sake of that goal everything was permissible - to lie, to steal, to destroy hundreds of thousands and even millions of people... everyone who stood in the way\".\n\nThe violence that characterized the forced collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union eventually ended in the final years of the 1930s with the defeat of the Kulaks and their demise. By the 1950s, agriculture was entirely collectivized and the peasantry ceased to exist, as all agricultural workers held the same essential social relationship to their means of production as other industrial workers thus making them part of a working class.\n\n===Polarized values===\nWhile somewhat modified since the times of the [[d\u00e9tente]], communist propaganda is centered around a number of polarized dichotomies: virtues of the communist world vs. vices of the capitalist world, such as:<ref name=clews/>\n*communists are for peace; capitalists are for war\n*communists are for mutual cooperation; capitalists are for coercive exploitation\n*communists are for democracy; capitalists are for oligarchy\n\nStill another polarization was focused on the real and alleged essence of various terms, such as \"[[Political freedom|freedom]]\", \"[[democracy]]\", <!-- {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} I know I have to provide ref, but this is a rather well-known fact --> often counterpointing, e.g.,  \"bourgeois democracy\" vs.  \"true democracy\" or \"people's democracy\". The latter term is seen in the expression \"countries of people's democracy\" as applied to what are called \"[[communist states]]\" in the West.<ref>John Connelly (2000),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=OyU6o8V_K90C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22countries+of+people's+democracy%22&source=web&ots=AZp69ioI1e&sig=sEB5FDzNtnzXR3Rc0CVETXDbpLQ&hl=en p. 48]</ref>\n\n===Self-criticism===\nAccording to [[Jacques Ellul]]'s book ''[[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes]]'' complete propaganda can only be achieved when it is able to win over the adversary, or at least integrate it into the new frame of reference created by propaganda. This was achieved by Soviet propaganda in the self-criticism of its opponents so that the enemy of a regime can be made to declare, while still the enemy, that the regime was right and any opposition was criminal.<ref>Ellul, Jacques (1965).

Communist propaganda is defined as a scientifically based system of the dissemination of the communist ideology with the purpose of education, training and organizing of the masses.\n\n==Purposes==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' identifies the following functions of communist propaganda:<ref>''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', [http://bse.sci-lib.com/article093385.html Propaganda] article</ref>\n*The link of the Communist Party with the [[working class]] and other working people<ref>In the communist and Soviet parlance the \"worker class\" is the class of industrial workers, while \"other working people\" includes other \"non-exploiting\" classes</ref>\n*Incorporation of [[scientific socialism]] into the worker movements and revolutionary activities of the masses\n*Unification and organization of national divisions of the workers', communist, and democratic movements\n*Coordination of the activities of the above-mentioned movements, exchange of information and experience\n*Expression of the [[public opinion]] of the working class, working people, their needs and interests\n*Spread opposition to the bourgeois and revisionist propaganda\n*Dissemination of statistical data about socialist society (i.e., the one of a [[communist state]]).\n\n==Targets==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nAs a common trait of any propaganda and its analogue, [[advertising]], communist propaganda's goals and techniques are tuned according to the target audience. The most broad classification of targets is:<ref name=clews>John C. Clews (1964) ''Communist Propaganda techniques'', printed in the USA by ''[[Frederick A. Praeger|Praeger]]'' and in Great Britain</ref>\n*Domestic propaganda of the communist states\n*External propaganda of the communist states\n*Propaganda of the communist supporters outside the communist states\n\nA more detailed classification of specific targets (workers, peasants, youth, women, etc.) may be found in the Communist Party documents, usually presented at the Congresses of the Communist Party.<ref name=clews/>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Use of Marxist ideology===\n{{Further|Marxism}}\n\nThe creation of the [[Soviet Union]] was presented as the most important turning event in human history, based on the Marxist theory of [[historical materialism]]. This theory identified [[means of production]] as chief determinants of the historical process. They led to the creation of [[social class]]es, and [[class struggle]] was the 'motor' of history. The [[sociocultural evolution]] of societies had to progress inevitably from [[slavery]], through [[feudalism]] and [[capitalism]] to communism. Furthermore, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] became the protagonist of history, as a \"vanguard of the working class\", according to development of this theory by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Hence the unlimited powers of the Communist Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the history itself.<ref name=\"Satter1\">[[David Satter]]. ''Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union'', [[Yale University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08705-5}}</ref> It also followed that a worldwide victory of [[communist countries]] is inevitable.\n\nClass struggle played a central role in the social policies of the USSR and socialist countries, all of which constitutionally outlined the [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|supremacy of the working class in dictating society's development]] towards communism. Other classes with interests hostile to those of the working class were subjected to repression. This primarily focused on capitalists, including anyone who derived their living from privately owning property or capital assets. In the USSR, which was founded on a class alliance between workers and peasants, a neo-capitalist class emerged by the 1930s as a result of the [[New Economic Policy]] introduced after the end of the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]]. Among the peasants, this new class (called Kulaks) accumulated disproportionately large amounts of wealth through merchant trading and small capital practices. Under [[Joseph Stalin]], the government began to [[Dekulakization|crack down on the Kulaks]], to which their resistance was met with violent repression in what could arguably considered a second civil war. Kulaks who resisted the socialization of their assets, along with anyone who collaborated with or fought for them, were punished with imprisonment, deportation to [[Siberia]], or even execution. [[Lev Kopelev]], who was personally involved in actions against villagers deprived of food for collaborating with Kulaks explained his motivation:<ref name=\"kulak\">\"Reflections on a ravaged century\", pages 93-95</ref>\n\n:\"It was excruciating to see and hear all this. And even worse to take part in it.... And I persuaded myself, explained to myself. I must not give in to debilitating pity. We were realizing [[Marx's theory of history|historical necessity]]. We were performing our [[Revolution|revolutionary duty]]. We were obtaining grain for our [[Socialism|socialist]] Fatherland. For the [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)|Five Year Plan]]. Our goal was the universal triumph of the [[Communism]], and for the sake of that goal everything was permissible - to lie, to steal, to destroy hundreds of thousands and even millions of people... everyone who stood in the way\".\n\nThe violence that characterized the forced collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union eventually ended in the final years of the 1930s with the defeat of the Kulaks and their demise. By the 1950s, agriculture was entirely collectivized and the peasantry ceased to exist, as all agricultural workers held the same essential social relationship to their means of production as other industrial workers thus making them part of a working class.\n\n===Polarized values===\nWhile somewhat modified since the times of the [[d\u00e9tente]], communist propaganda is centered around a number of polarized dichotomies: virtues of the communist world vs. vices of the capitalist world, such as:<ref name=clews/>\n*communists are for peace; capitalists are for war\n*communists are for mutual cooperation; capitalists are for coercive exploitation\n*communists are for democracy; capitalists are for oligarchy\n\nStill another polarization was focused on the real and alleged essence of various terms, such as \"[[Political freedom|freedom]]\", \"[[democracy]]\", <!-- {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} I know I have to provide ref, but this is a rather well-known fact --> often counterpointing, e.g.,  \"bourgeois democracy\" vs.  \"true democracy\" or \"people's democracy\". The latter term is seen in the expression \"countries of people's democracy\" as applied to what are called \"[[communist states]]\" in the West.<ref>John Connelly (2000),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=OyU6o8V_K90C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22countries+of+people's+democracy%22&source=web&ots=AZp69ioI1e&sig=sEB5FDzNtnzXR3Rc0CVETXDbpLQ&hl=en p. 48]</ref>\n\n===Self-criticism===\nAccording to [[Jacques Ellul]]'s book ''[[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes]]'' complete propaganda can only be achieved when it is able to win over the adversary, or at least integrate it into the new frame of reference created by propaganda. This was achieved by Soviet propaganda in the self-criticism of its opponents so that the enemy of a regime can be made to declare, while still the enemy, that the regime was right and any opposition was criminal.<ref>Ellul, Jacques (1965).

The book was translated into many languages.\n\n===Communist periodicals===\nA number of periodicals were printed by communist states, either exclusively for distribution abroad or with versions tailored for foreign audiences. While the Soviet Union and Communist China were the major contributors, other communist states contributed their share as well. The lists below are for early 1960s compiled by J. Clews.

These broadcasts originated not only from Moscow, but also from the countries of the [[Soviet Bloc]], as well as from fake \"underground resistance\" radios probably located within the Soviet Bloc as well  rather than in the West.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2746127 \"Communist broadcasts to Italy\"], Harold Mendelsohn and Werner J.

Soviet films helped to create the legends of the revolution: ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'', and ''[[The End of St. Petersburg]]''. [[Roman Karmen]] was a war cameraman and film director and one of the most influential figures in [[documentary film]] making.
