The share of agricultural land exceeds 80% in [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]] and neighbouring [[H\u1eadu Giang Province]] and is below 50% only in [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]] (32%) and [[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province]] (42%).<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> The region's land used for growing cereals makes up 47% of the national total, more than northern and central Vietnam combined. Most of this is used for rice cultivation.\n\nRice output in 2011 was 23,186,000t, 54.8% of Vietnam's total output. The strongest producers are [[Ki\u00ean Giang Province]], An Giang Province, and [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province]], producing over 3 million tonnes each and almost 11&nbsp;million tonnes together. Any two of these provinces produce more than the entire [[Red River Delta]].<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> Only three provinces produce less than 1 million tonnes of rice ([[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province]], [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]], [[B\u1ebfn Tre Province]]).<ref name=\"GSO11\"/>\n\n===Fishery===\nThe Mekong Delta is also Vietnam's most important fishing region. It has almost half of Vietnam's capacity of offshore fishing vessels (mostly in Kien Gian with almost 1/4, B\u1ebfn Tre, C\u00e0 Mau, Ti\u1ec1n Giang, B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau). Fishery output was at 3.168&nbsp;million tons (58.3% of Vietnam) and has experienced rapid growth from 1.84mt in 2005.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> All of Vietnam's largest fishery producers with over 300kt of output are in the Mekong Delta: Ki\u00ean Giang, C\u00e0 Mau, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p, An Giang, and B\u1ebfn Tre.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/>\n\nDespite the region's large offshore fishing fleet, 2/3 (2.13 million tonnes out of Vietnam's total of 2.93) of fishery output actually comes from aquaculture.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/>\n\nDecember 2015, aquaculture production was estimated at 357 thousand tons, up 11% compared to the same period last year, bringing the total aquaculture production 3516 thousand tons in 2015, up 3.0% compared to the same period. Although aquaculture production has increased overall, aquaculture still faces many difficulties coming from export markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ractravel.net/mekong-delta-tour|title=Mekong Delta Tours \u2013 Official MeKong delta Travel}}</ref>\n\n===Industry and FDI===\n\nThe Mekong Delta is not strongly industrialized, but is still the third out of seven regions in terms of industrial [[gross output]]. The region's industry accounts for 10% of Vietnam's total as of 2011.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> Almost half of the region's industrial production is concentrated in [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]], Long An Province and [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]]. C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 is the economic center of the region and more industrialized than the other provinces.

The share of agricultural land exceeds 80% in [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]] and neighbouring [[H\u1eadu Giang Province]] and is below 50% only in [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]] (32%) and [[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province]] (42%).<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> The region's land used for growing cereals makes up 47% of the national total, more than northern and central Vietnam combined. Most of this is used for rice cultivation.\n\nRice output in 2011 was 23,186,000t, 54.8% of Vietnam's total output. The strongest producers are [[Ki\u00ean Giang Province]], An Giang Province, and [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province]], producing over 3 million tonnes each and almost 11&nbsp;million tonnes together. Any two of these provinces produce more than the entire [[Red River Delta]].<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> Only three provinces produce less than 1 million tonnes of rice ([[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province]], [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]], [[B\u1ebfn Tre Province]]).<ref name=\"GSO11\"/>\n\n===Fishery===\nThe Mekong Delta is also Vietnam's most important fishing region. It has almost half of Vietnam's capacity of offshore fishing vessels (mostly in Kien Gian with almost 1/4, B\u1ebfn Tre, C\u00e0 Mau, Ti\u1ec1n Giang, B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau). Fishery output was at 3.168&nbsp;million tons (58.3% of Vietnam) and has experienced rapid growth from 1.84mt in 2005.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> All of Vietnam's largest fishery producers with over 300kt of output are in the Mekong Delta: Ki\u00ean Giang, C\u00e0 Mau, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p, An Giang, and B\u1ebfn Tre.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/>\n\nDespite the region's large offshore fishing fleet, 2/3 (2.13 million tonnes out of Vietnam's total of 2.93) of fishery output actually comes from aquaculture.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/>\n\nDecember 2015, aquaculture production was estimated at 357 thousand tons, up 11% compared to the same period last year, bringing the total aquaculture production 3516 thousand tons in 2015, up 3.0% compared to the same period. Although aquaculture production has increased overall, aquaculture still faces many difficulties coming from export markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ractravel.net/mekong-delta-tour|title=Mekong Delta Tours \u2013 Official MeKong delta Travel}}</ref>\n\n===Industry and FDI===\n\nThe Mekong Delta is not strongly industrialized, but is still the third out of seven regions in terms of industrial [[gross output]]. The region's industry accounts for 10% of Vietnam's total as of 2011.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> Almost half of the region's industrial production is concentrated in [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]], Long An Province and [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]]. C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 is the economic center of the region and more industrialized than the other provinces. Long An has been the only province of the region to attract part of the manufacturing booming around [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and is seen by other provinces as an example of successful FDI attraction.<ref name=STFDI>{{cite news|title=N\u00e2ng n\u1ed9i l\u1ef1c, h\u00fat v\u1ed1n FDI v\u00e0o \u0110BSCL|url=http://www.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/kinhdoanh/dautu/88390/|accessdate=January 5, 2013|newspaper=Saigon Times|date=December 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173852/http://www.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/kinhdoanh/dautu/88390/|archive-date=October 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]] is home to a large industrial zone including power plants and a fertiliser factory.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gas, fertiliser industrial zone opens in Ca Mau|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/Industries/231993/gas-fertiliser-industrial-zone-opens-in-ca-mau.html|accessdate=January 5, 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=October 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccumulated foreign direct investment in the Mekong Delta until 2011 was $10.257bn.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> It has been highly concentrated in a few provinces, led by Long An and Ki\u00ean Giang with over $3bn each, Ti\u1ec1n Giang and C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 (around 850m), C\u00e0 Mau (780m) and H\u1eadu Giang (673m), while the other provinces have received less than 200m each.<ref name=\"GSO11\"/> In general, the performance of the region in attracting FDI is evaluated as unsatisfactory by local analysts and policymakers.<ref name=STFDI/> \nCompanies from [[Ho Chi Minh City]] have also invested heavily in the region.

Cai Luong Singing appeared in Mekong Delta in the early 20th century. Cai Luong Singing is often performed in the soundtrack of guitar and zither. Cai Luong is a kind of play telling a story.
