She and Max's younger brother, Michael, confront Max over the wisdom of using his abilities to save Liz's life. Max becomes overburdened by guilt and decides to tell Liz who he truly is, unaware that Liz has secretly taken a DNA sample from him and analyzed it.

Liz and Max go on a trip into the desert, where Max confesses his dream to be a writer. Alex and Michael discover they are attracted to each other, and hook up.

Jenna questions Wyatt, who professes ignorance of trying to kill Liz, and witnesses him unconsciously sketching Max's symbol. Mimi gives Alex a vague warning about not ending up like Jim Valenti and his father, and mistakes Liz for Rosa, which she plays along with to gain her trust.

Max discovers that Liz has been conducting experiments using his DNA to develop a serum that neutralizes alien powers; Isobel, wracked with guilt, agrees to be placed on a temporary psych hold.

Alex learns from Jesse's files that Michael is an alien. With no other options, Liz turns to alien research conducted by Michael in secret, which leads her to conclude that Isobel can only be saved by using the pods to keep her in suspended animation. Deducing that silver affects the pods, Liz concocts a substance to get Isobel into one of the pods, which she consents to after overhearing Max ranting about how he wishes he loved her less.
