Crokin''' is a American columnist and novelist.\n\n==Early life and career==\nCrokin grew up in [[Glenview, Illinois]] and graduated from [[New Trier High School]]. She attended the [[University of Iowa]] studying political science and journalism. While there, she was an organizer for Students for Bush, a large organization supporting the [[George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign]]. She later [[intern]]ed at the [[U.S. State Department]] during Bush's first term and for conservative pundit [[Bill O'Reilly]]'s show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' on [[Fox News]].\n\nCrokin began work in 2002 for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', before moving to their ''[[RedEye]]'' daily tabloid writing a column called \"Liz in the Loop\" (previously \"Eye Contact\") which covered celebrity news in the Chicago area. In 2010, Crokin moved to [[Los Angeles]] and began working as a freelance entertainment reporter for ''[[National Enquirer]]'', ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'', ''[[In Touch Weekly]]'', ''[[US Weekly]]'' where she focused on celebrity [[breakup]]s. Crokin returned to Chicago in 2012 to work for ''Splash'', a ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' publication at the time, writing a column called \"LA LA Liz\".\n\nIn September 2012, Crokin developed a viral form of [[meningitis]] caused by [[genital herpes]] which progressed into [[meningoencephalitis]] and caused daily [[migraine]]s, [[vertigo]], and [[photophobia]] resulting from brain damage. Crokin blamed the initial herpes infection on an ex-boyfriend - a wealthy businessman from Los Angeles - against whom she later filed a personal injury lawsuit.\n\nHer health problems resulted in a loss of work, including being laid off in 2013 by [[American Media Inc.]], parent company of ''Star'' and ''National Enquirer''. Crokin and others had previously accused AMI content officer [[Dylan Howard]] of sexual harassment, and has suggested that the layoffs were done in retaliation.<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite news |last1=Pearson |first1=Jake |last2=Horwitz |first2=Jeff |title=Top editor of National Enquirer, Us Weekly accused of sexual misconduct |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-gossip-editor-dylan-howard-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-20171205-story.html |accessdate=April 14, 2020 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 5, 2017}}</ref> Crokin's column in ''Splash'' ended in February 2014.\n\n==''Malice'' book==\n''Malice'' won the \"Wild Card\" category at the 2015 [[Hollywood Book Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |title=10th Annual Hollywood Book Festival Honors \"Old Earth\" with Top Prize |url=http://hollywoodbkfest.brinkster.net/winners2015.htm |publisher=[[Hollywood Book Festival]] |accessdate=April 14, 2020 |location=[[Hollywood]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Popdust\">{{cite news |last1=McCoppin |first1=Suzy |title=Liz Crokin Vows To Win Herpes Lawsuit\u2014Has Obligation To Protect Future Victims |url=https://www.popdust.com/liz-crokin-vows-to-win-herpes-lawsuithas-obligation-to-protect-future--1891374118.html |accessdate=April 14, 2020 |work=Popdust |date=August 14, 2015 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Recent work==\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|lizcrokin.com}}\n* {{YouTube|c=UCL5QWloOWiD_H6nc_05PHBA}}\n* {{IMDb name|nm4842685}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crokin, Liz}}\n[[Category:1979 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American women television journalists]]\n[[Category:21st-century American journalists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox writer\n| embed            = \n| honorific_prefix = \n| name             = Liz Crokin\n| honorific_suffix = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| image_upright    = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n| pseudonym        = \n| birth_name       = \n| birth_date       = {{Birth date and age|1979|02|08}}\n| birth_place      = \n| death_date       = <!-- {{Death date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n| death_place      = \n| resting_place    = \n| occupation       = columnist and novelist\n| language         = \n| residence        = [[Los Angeles, California]]\n| nationality      = \n| citizenship      = \n| education        = \n| alma_mater       = [[University of Iowa]]\n| home_town        = [[Glenview, Illinois]]\n| period           = \n| genre            = <!-- or: | genres = -->\n| subject          = <!-- or: | subjects = -->\n| movement         = \n| notable_works    = \n| spouse           = <!-- or: | spouses = -->\n| partner          = <!-- or: | partners = -->\n| children         = \n| relatives        = \n| awards           = \n| signature        = \n| signature_alt    = \n| years_active     = \n| module           = \n| website          = {{URL|lizcrokin.com}}\n| portaldisp       = <!-- \"on\", \"yes\", \"true\", etc.; or omit -->\n}}\n\n'''Liz M.
