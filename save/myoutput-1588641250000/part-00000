John was allegedly banished by the Roman authorities to the Greek island of [[Patmos]], where, according to tradition, he wrote the [[Book of Revelation]]. According to [[Tertullian]] (in ''The Prescription of Heretics'') John was banished (presumably to Patmos) after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome and suffering nothing from it. It is said that all in the audience of [[Colosseum]] were converted to Christianity upon witnessing this miracle. This event would have occurred in the late 1st century, during the reign of the Emperor [[Domitian]], who was known for his persecution of Christians.\n\nWhen John was aged, he trained [[Polycarp]] who later became [[Bishop of Smyrna]]. This was important because Polycarp was able to carry John's message to future generations. Polycarp taught [[Irenaeus]], passing on to him stories about John. Similarly, [[Ignatius of Antioch]] was a student of John and later appointed by [[Saint Peter]] to be the Bishop of Antioch. In ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', Irenaeus relates how Polycarp told a story of \n{{quote |John, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving [[Cerinthus]] within, rushed out of the [[Thermae|bath-house]] without bathing, exclaiming, \"Let us fly, lest even the bath-house fall down, because [[Cerinthus]], the enemy of the truth, is within.\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', III.3.4.</ref>}}\n\nIt is traditionally believed that John was the youngest of the apostles and survived them.

John was allegedly banished by the Roman authorities to the Greek island of [[Patmos]], where, according to tradition, he wrote the [[Book of Revelation]]. According to [[Tertullian]] (in ''The Prescription of Heretics'') John was banished (presumably to Patmos) after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome and suffering nothing from it.
