The university helped nationalists establish a system of education for all Indians, thus proving the country's independence from British-run institutions and de-legitimizing the [[British Raj]]. Its foundation was one of the important event of an initiative  [[satyagraha]] launched by Gandhi as a means to peacefully terminate British rule in India.\n\nThe vidyapith's foundation was emulated by nationalists in [[Varanasi|Benares]], [[Bombay]], [[Calcutta]], [[Nagpur]], [[Madras]] and in many cities across India. Answering Gandhi's call to boycott British institutions, influences and goods, many thousands of students and teachers left British colleges to join the Vidyapith.\n\nPeople like [[Jivatram Kripalani]] and [[Nanabhai Bhatt (Lokbharti)|Nanabhai Bhatt]] volunteered to teach.\n\nThe Gujarat Vidyapith became a 'deemed university' in 1963. It is funded and governed by the University Grants Commission, under the Union Ministry for Human Resources Development in [[New Delhi]].
