It is located in the Bachok district, near the tourist area of the Tok Bali beach. UMK began operating officially on 1 September 2006. The campus covers an area of 553.8 acres and is being developed in two phases with the first phase covering an area of 254 acres with the other phase occupying the remaining 300 acres of landspace in the future. Part of the campus is made up of a former paddy plantation which is suitable for development. The area is surrounded by schools, villages and a technical skills development institute.\n\nThe campus is divided into eight zones with the First Phase containing the commercial, academic, public spaces and residential zones; whereas the Second Phase will incorporate a sports complex, a park, a staff residential complex, a commercial zone and a Wetland Park.\n\nThe main entrance to the campus under the First Phase is through the P2 door with the UMK mosque minaret as the main focus point. The building layout of the campus is pedestrian-friendly, with the buildings being separated from each other at a distance of 400 meters.\n\nThe First Phase of the development involves the entrepreneurship and business faculty, the arts faculty, the university's language centre, the academic administration building, lecture halls and rooms, the administrative building, public spaces; and the Islamic centre and the mosque. This phase currently houses around 2,160 undergraduates and 500 campus staff. The Bachok campus of UMK will be later transformed into a park campus.\n\n==Jeli Campus==\nThe Faculty of Agro Industry and Natural Resources was stationed at UMK Taman Bendahara in Pengkalan Chepa until 19 January 2012. The faculty has moved to the new campus in Gemang, Jeli. The campus is located on 270 acres that includes the department of sciences and technology of FASA as well as the administrative office. In April 2012, FASA was dissolved and two new faculties were formed. They are the Faculty of Agro-based Industry and Faculty of Earth Sciences with a total of 900 undergraduates and postgraduates students. There are 74 academic staff of which 41 academic staff are on study leave, 55 non academic staff and 12 international academic staff.\n\nFor the September 2012 intake, students\u2019 enrolment is expected to increase to 1500 students for seven undergraduate academic programmes and postgraduate programmes. There is only one building in the campus which is shared with the two faculties and the administrative office. The campus has a hall, library and hostels for the students. Due to the fact that there is only one building for the administration and academic purposes, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine has to remain at UMK Padang Tembak. The faculty will move to UMK Jeli soon.\n\nThe first batch of FASA of 42 students graduated during the last convocation ceremony in September 2011.\n\nJeli campus\n\n==The concept of Jeli Campus==\n\"In Forest Park Campus\"<br>\nJeli campus is located in a rural area surrounded by hills and greenery that provide a cool (during monsoon) and very hot atmosphere. The campus holds on to the concept of \"campus in Forest Park\" as the core of the campus physical development even though food is more expensive compared to the Bachok campus  . It is a very undevelop university.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of universities in Malaysia]]\n\n==References==\n{{third-party|date=November 2015}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Universiti Malaysia Kelantan}}\n* [http://www.umk.edu.my/ Universiti Malaysia Kelantan]\n\n{{Public universities in Malaysia}}\n{{East Coast Economic Region}}\n{{coord|6|09|52|N|102|16|57|E|region:MY_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malaysia Kelantan}}\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Kelantan]]\n[[Category:Public universities in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Technical universities and colleges in Malaysia]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=February 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox university\n| name              = University of Malaysia Kelantan\n| native_name       = \u0627\u0648\u0646\u064a\u06cf\u0631\u0633\u064a\u062a\u064a \u0645\u0644\u064a\u0633\u064a\u0627 \u0643\u0644\u0646\u062a\u0646\n| image_name        = Logo_Universiti_Malaysia_Kelantan.png\n| image_size        = 90px\n| caption           = \n| motto             = \n| mottoeng          = Entrepreneurship Is Our Thrust\n| established       = 2007\n| closed            = \n| type              = [[Public university|Public]]\n| affiliation       = \n| endowment         = \n| rector            = \n| officer_in_charge = \n| chancellor        = [[Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra|Dr. Tengku Muhammad Fa-iz Petra ibni Almarhum Sultan Ismail Petra]], Tengku Mahkota Kelantan\n| vice-president    = \n| superintendent    = \n| vice_chancellor   = Prof. Dr. Noor Azizi Ismail\n| principal         = \n| dean              = \n| director          = \n| head_label        = Pro-Chancellor\n| head              = [[:ms:Tengku Mohamad Rizam Tengku Abdul Aziz|Tengku Tan Sri Dato' Haji Mohamad Rizam bin Tengku Abdul Aziz]], Tengku Temenggong Kelantan\n| chairman          = Dato' Dr. Hussamuddin bin Hj.

It is located in the Bachok district, near the tourist area of the Tok Bali beach. UMK began operating officially on 1 September 2006. The campus covers an area of 553.8 acres and is being developed in two phases with the first phase covering an area of 254 acres with the other phase occupying the remaining 300 acres of landspace in the future. Part of the campus is made up of a former paddy plantation which is suitable for development. The area is surrounded by schools, villages and a technical skills development institute.\n\nThe campus is divided into eight zones with the First Phase containing the commercial, academic, public spaces and residential zones; whereas the Second Phase will incorporate a sports complex, a park, a staff residential complex, a commercial zone and a Wetland Park.\n\nThe main entrance to the campus under the First Phase is through the P2 door with the UMK mosque minaret as the main focus point. The building layout of the campus is pedestrian-friendly, with the buildings being separated from each other at a distance of 400 meters.\n\nThe First Phase of the development involves the entrepreneurship and business faculty, the arts faculty, the university's language centre, the academic administration building, lecture halls and rooms, the administrative building, public spaces; and the Islamic centre and the mosque. This phase currently houses around 2,160 undergraduates and 500 campus staff. The Bachok campus of UMK will be later transformed into a park campus.\n\n==Jeli Campus==\nThe Faculty of Agro Industry and Natural Resources was stationed at UMK Taman Bendahara in Pengkalan Chepa until 19 January 2012. The faculty has moved to the new campus in Gemang, Jeli. The campus is located on 270 acres that includes the department of sciences and technology of FASA as well as the administrative office. In April 2012, FASA was dissolved and two new faculties were formed. They are the Faculty of Agro-based Industry and Faculty of Earth Sciences with a total of 900 undergraduates and postgraduates students. There are 74 academic staff of which 41 academic staff are on study leave, 55 non academic staff and 12 international academic staff.\n\nFor the September 2012 intake, students\u2019 enrolment is expected to increase to 1500 students for seven undergraduate academic programmes and postgraduate programmes. There is only one building in the campus which is shared with the two faculties and the administrative office. The campus has a hall, library and hostels for the students. Due to the fact that there is only one building for the administration and academic purposes, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine has to remain at UMK Padang Tembak. The faculty will move to UMK Jeli soon.\n\nThe first batch of FASA of 42 students graduated during the last convocation ceremony in September 2011.\n\nJeli campus\n\n==The concept of Jeli Campus==\n\"In Forest Park Campus\"<br>\nJeli campus is located in a rural area surrounded by hills and greenery that provide a cool (during monsoon) and very hot atmosphere. The campus holds on to the concept of \"campus in Forest Park\" as the core of the campus physical development even though food is more expensive compared to the Bachok campus  . It is a very undevelop university.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of universities in Malaysia]]\n\n==References==\n{{third-party|date=November 2015}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Universiti Malaysia Kelantan}}\n* [http://www.umk.edu.my/ Universiti Malaysia Kelantan]\n\n{{Public universities in Malaysia}}\n{{East Coast Economic Region}}\n{{coord|6|09|52|N|102|16|57|E|region:MY_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malaysia Kelantan}}\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Kelantan]]\n[[Category:Public universities in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Technical universities and colleges in Malaysia]]\n", "name_user": "Wakpiz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:adding link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universiti_Malaysia_Kelantan"}
