It includes Lake [[Trasimeno]] and [[Cascata delle Marmore|Marmore Falls]], and is crossed by the River [[Tiber]]. The regional capital is [[Perugia]]. Umbria is known for its landscapes, traditions, history, culinary delights, artistic legacy, and influence on culture.\n\nThe region is characterized by hills, mountains, valleys and historical towns such as the university centre of [[Perugia]], [[Assisi]], a [[World Heritage Site]] associated with [[St. Francis of Assisi]], [[Terni]], [[Norcia]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Gubbio]], [[Spoleto]], [[Orvieto]], [[Todi]], [[Castiglione del Lago]], [[Narni]], [[Amelia, Umbria|Amelia]], and other small cities.\n\n== Geography ==\nUmbria is bordered by [[Tuscany]] to the west and the north, [[Marche]] to the east and [[Lazio]] to the south. Partly hilly and mountainous, and partly flat and fertile owing to the valley of the [[Tiber]], its topography includes part of the central [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], with the highest point in the region at [[Monte Vettore]] on the border of the Marche, at {{convert|2,476|m|0|abbr=off}}; the lowest point is [[Attigliano]], {{convert|96|m|0|abbr=off}}. It is the only Italian region having neither a coastline nor a common border with other countries. The [[comune]] of Citt\u00e0 di Castello has an exclave named Monte Ruperto within Marche. Contained within Umbria is the hamlet of [[Cospaia]], which was a tiny republic from 1440 to 1826, created by accident.\n\nUmbria is crossed by two valleys: the Umbrian valley (\"Valle Umbra\"), stretching from Perugia to Spoleto, and the Tiber Valley (\"Val Tiberina\"), north and west of the first one, from Citt\u00e0 di Castello to the border with Lazio. The Tiber River forms the approximate border with Lazio, although its source is just over the Tuscan border. The Tiber's three principal tributaries flow southward through Umbria. The [[Chiascio]] basin is relatively uninhabited as far as [[Bastia Umbra]]. About {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} farther on, it joins the Tiber at [[Torgiano]]. The [[Topino River|Topino]], cleaving the Apennines with passes that the [[Via Flaminia]] and successor roads follow, makes a sharp turn at [[Foligno]] to flow NW for a few kilometres before joining the Chiascio below [[Bettona]]. The third river is the [[Nera (Italy)|Nera]], flowing into the Tiber further south, at Terni; its valley is called the ''Valnerina''. The upper Nera cuts ravines in the mountains; the lower, in the Tiber basin, has created a wide floodplain.\n\nIn antiquity, the plain was covered by a pair of shallow, interlocking lakes, the Lacus Clitorius and the Lacus Umber. They were drained by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] over several hundred years. An earthquake in the 4th&nbsp;century and the political collapse of the Roman Empire resulted in the refilling of the basin. It was drained a second time, almost a thousand years later, during a 500-year period: [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks started the process in the 13th century, and the draining was completed by an engineer from Foligno in the 18th century.\n\nThe eastern part of the region, being crossed by many [[Fault (geology)|faults]], has been often hit by earthquakes: the last ones have been [[1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake|that of 1997]] (which hit Foligno, Assisi and [[Nocera Umbra]]) and [[October 2016 Central Italy earthquakes|those of 2016]] (which struck [[Norcia]] and the Valnerina).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Casalini|first1=Simona|title=Terremoto in Centro Italia|url=http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/10/30/news/terremoto_rieti-150898762/?ref=HREA-1|accessdate=30 October 2016|work=Repubblica|date=30 October 2016|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nIn literature, Umbria is referred to as ''Il cuore verde d'Italia'' or ''The green heart of Italy''. The phrase is taken from a poem by [[Giosu\u00e8 Carducci]], the subject of which is the source of the [[Clitunno River]] in Umbria.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Umbria}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Perugia panoramic.jpg|thumb|300px|Cityscape of the capital Perugia]]\n[[File:UmbriaPanorama.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical landscape of the Umbrian countryside]]\n[[File:Panorama-Assisi.jpg|thumb|300px|View of [[Assisi]]]]\n[[File:Norcia-panorama.jpg|300px|thumb|View of [[Norcia]]]]\n[[File:Gubbio Palazzo dei Consoli z02.jpg|thumb|right|View of the medieval town of Gubbio]]\n[[File:Orvieto-Le D\u00f4me-Fa\u00e7ade-.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Orvieto Cathedral]]]]\n===Antiquity===\nThe region is named for the [[Umbri]] people, an [[Italic people]] which was absorbed by the expansion of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Umbri's capital city was [[Gubbio]], which now houses   the longest and most important document of any of the [[Osco-Umbrian]] group of languages, the [[Iguvine Tablets]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] recounted a fanciful derivation for the tribal name from the Greek \u1f44\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"a shower\", which led to the idea that they had survived the Deluge familiar from Greek mythology, allowing them to claim to be the most ancient race in Italy.<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', 3.6; 3.19.</ref> In fact, they belonged to a broader family of neighbouring peoples with similar roots. Their language was [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]], one of the [[Italic languages]], related  to [[Latin]] and [[Oscan language|Oscan]]. The northern part of the region was occupied by [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes.\n\nThe Umbri probably sprang, like neighbouring peoples, from the creators of the [[Terramara]], and [[Proto-Villanovan culture]] in northern and central Italy, who entered north-eastern Italy at the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe [[Etruscans]] were the chief enemies of the Umbri. The Etruscan invasion extended from the western seaboard towards the north and east from about 700 to 500 BC. They eventually drove the Umbrians towards the [[Apennines|Apennine]] uplands and captured 300 Umbrian towns. Nevertheless, the Umbrian population does not seem to have been eradicated in the conquered districts. The border between Etruria and Umbria was the Tiber river, as established by the ancient name of Todi, ''Tular'' (\"border\").\n\nAfter the downfall of the Etruscans, Umbrians aided the [[Samnium|Samnite]]s in their [[Samnite Wars|struggle]] against [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (308 BC). Later communications with [[Samnium]] were impeded by the Roman fortress of [[Narni]]a (founded 298 BC). Romans defeated the Samnites and their Gallic allies in the [[battle of Sentinum]] (295 BC). Allied Umbrians and Etruscans had to return home and defend each of their territories against simultaneous Roman attacks, leaving the Samnites without their help in the battle of Sentinum.\n\nThe Roman victory at Sentinum initiated a period of integration under the Roman rulers, who established some colonies, such as [[Spoletium]], and built the [[via Flaminia]] (220 BC). The via Flaminia became a principal vector for Roman development in Umbria. During [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]]'s invasion during the [[second Punic war]], the [[battle of Lake Trasimene]] was fought in Umbria, but the local people did not aid the invader.\n\nDuring the [[Roman civil war]] between [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavian]] (40 BC), the city of Perugia supported Antony and was almost completely destroyed by Octavian. In [[Pliny the Elder]]'s time, 49 independent communities still existed in Umbria, and the abundance of inscriptions and the high proportion of recruits in the [[Roman Army|imperial army]] attest to its population. Under Augustus, Umbria became [[Roman Umbria|the Regio VI]] of Roman Italy.\n\nModern Umbria is different from [[Roman Umbria]]. Roman Umbria extended through most of what is now the northern Marche to [[Ravenna]], but excluded the west bank of the Tiber, which belonged to Etruria. Thus [[Perusia|Perugia]] was an Etruscan city and the area around Norcia was in the [[Sabine]] territory.\n\nAfter the collapse of the [[Roman empire]], [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] struggled for supremacy in the region, and the [[Battle of Taginae|decisive battle]] of the war between these two peoples took place near modern [[Gualdo Tadino]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter the Ostrogoths, the [[Lombards]] founded the [[duchy of Spoleto]], covering much of today's southern Umbria, but the Byzantine were able to keep in the region a corridor along the Via Flaminia linking Rome with the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis|Pentapolis]]. The Lombard king controlled also the northern part of the region ruled directly by Pavia. When [[Charlemagne]] conquered most of the Lombard kingdoms, some Umbrian territories were given to the Pope, who established temporal power over them. Some cities acquired a form of autonomy named ''[[Medieval commune|comune]]''.  These cities were frequently at war with each other, often in a context of more general conflicts, either between the [[Church State|Papacy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] or between the [[Guelphs]] and the [[Ghibellines]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the ''[[signoria|signorie]]'' arose and the most important of them were those of the [[Vitelli]] in [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], of the Baglioni in Perugia and of the [[Trinci]] in [[Foligno]], but the two last ones were subsumed by the middle of the same century into the [[Papal States]] by [[Cardinal (catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who in this way prepared the return of the pope from [[Avignon]] to Rome. Citt\u00e0 di Castello was subsumed later into the Papal States by [[Cesare Borgia]]. During 15th century Renaissance spread in the northern part of the region. It was in this period that humanists started to use again the ancient denomination of \"Umbria\" to name the area, which until then has been named \"Ducato\", after the [[Duchy of Spoleto]] in the southern part of it. The supremacy of the pope on Umbria was reinforced in 16th century through the erection of a fortress in Perugia by Pope [[Paul III]], named after him Rocca Paolina. The Papacy ruled the region uncontested until the end of the 18th century.\n\n===Modern history===\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] and the French conquest of Italy, Umbria became part of the ephemeral [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131799) and later, part of the [[Napoleonic Empire]] (1809\u20131814) under the name of department of [[Trasim\u00e8ne]].\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat, the Pope regained Umbria and ruled it until 1860. In that year, during Italian [[Risorgimento]], Umbria with Marche and part of Emilia Romagna were annexed by [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Piedmontese]] King [[Victor Emmanuel II]], and the people of Perugia destroyed in the same year the Rocca Paolina, symbol of the papal oppression. The region of Umbria, with capital Perugia, was part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the following year. The region, whose economy was mainly based on agriculture, experienced a dramatic economic shift at the end of the 19th century with the founding of the ''Acciaierie di Terni'', a major steelwork placed in Terni because of its abundance of electric power due to the [[Marmore]] waterfall and its secluded position.\n\nThe region of Umbria at the time was somewhat larger than today, comprising [[province of Rieti|Rieti]] to the south, now part of [[Lazio]]. Rieti was detached and added to the Province of Rome (Lazio) in 1923. In 1927, the region of Umbria was divided into the provinces of Perugia and Terni.\n\nDuring WWII, the industrial centers of the region like Terni and Foligno were heavily bombed and in 1944 became a battlefield between the allied forces and the Germans retreating towards the [[Gothic Line]]. In 1946, Umbria was incorporated into the [[Italian Republic]] as a [[regions of Italy|region]], comprising the two provinces of Perugia and Terni.\n\n== Festivals ==\n[[File:Gubbio Corsa Ceri.jpg|thumb|Corsa dei ceri, or race of the \"candles\", which are symbolized by these tall wooden poles]]\nOne of the most important festivals in Umbria is \"the festival of the Ceri (Candles)\", also known as [[Saint Ubaldo Day]] in [[Gubbio]]. The race has been held every year since 1160, on the 15th day of May. The festival is focused around a race consisting of three teams of ''cerioli'', carrying large symbolic \"candles\" topped by saints, including St. [[Ubald]] (the patron saint of Gubbio), S. Giorgio ([[St. George]]), and S. Antonio ([[Anthony the Great]]), and run through throngs of cheering supporters.  The cerioli are clad in the distinctive colors of yellow, blue or black, according to the saint they support, with white trousers and red belts and neckbands. They travel up much of the mountain from the main square in front of the ''Palazzo dei Consoli'' to the basilica of St. Ubaldo, each team carrying a statue of their saint mounted on a wooden octagonal prism, similar to an hour-glass shape 4 metres tall and weighing about 280&nbsp;kg (617&nbsp;lb).\n\nThe race has strong devotional, civic, and historical overtones and is one of the best-known folklore manifestations in Italy, and therefore the Ceri were chosen as the heraldic emblem on the coat of arms of Umbria as a modern administrative region.\n\nUmbria is not only known for its historical recollections such as the festival of the Ceri, Calendimaggio, but also for one of the biggest jazz music festivals called Umbria Jazz. Umbria Jazz was born as a festival in 1973 and since 2003 has been held in the Umbrian capital \"Perugia\" in July; it has become the fixed appointment of all jazz and good music lovers.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe present economic structure emerged from a series of transformations which took place mainly in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, there was rapid expansion among small and medium-sized firms and a gradual retrenchment among the large firms which had hitherto characterised the region's industrial base. This process of structural adjustment is still going on.<ref name=\"circa.europa.eu\">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/ite2_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |website=Circa.europa.eu |accessdate=24 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721131757/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/ite2_eco.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEconomically the most important region is the upper Tiber valley with [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]]. [[Terni]] steelworks (stainless steel, titanium, alloy steel) and processing companies (automotive, stainless steel tubes, industrial food facility) account for 20 to 25 % of Umbria's GDP. In Terni there are also many multinational companies in the fields of chemistry, hydroelectric power, renewable sources of energy, and textiles ([[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]]). In the rest of the region the ornamental ceramics industry is much esteemed.<ref name=\"circa.europa.eu\"/>\n\nUmbrian agriculture is noted for its tobacco, [[olive oil]] and vineyards, which produce excellent wines. Regional varietals include the white [[Orvieto]], which draws agri-tourists to the vineyards in the area surrounding the medieval town of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/sagrantino-di-montalfalco-umbria-comes-best-red-wine-you-never-tasted|title=Sagrantino di Montefalco: From Umbria Comes The Best Red Wine You Never Tasted!|website=IntoWine.com|date=2 July 2007}}</ref> A notable wine is the Grechetto<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.umbriatourism.it/en_US/-/grechetto-di-todi|title=Grechetto di Todi|website=www.umbriatourism.it|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref> of [[Todi]].

It includes Lake [[Trasimeno]] and [[Cascata delle Marmore|Marmore Falls]], and is crossed by the River [[Tiber]]. The regional capital is [[Perugia]]. Umbria is known for its landscapes, traditions, history, culinary delights, artistic legacy, and influence on culture.\n\nThe region is characterized by hills, mountains, valleys and historical towns such as the university centre of [[Perugia]], [[Assisi]], a [[World Heritage Site]] associated with [[St. Francis of Assisi]], [[Terni]], [[Norcia]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Gubbio]], [[Spoleto]], [[Orvieto]], [[Todi]], [[Castiglione del Lago]], [[Narni]], [[Amelia, Umbria|Amelia]], and other small cities.\n\n== Geography ==\nUmbria is bordered by [[Tuscany]] to the west and the north, [[Marche]] to the east and [[Lazio]] to the south. Partly hilly and mountainous, and partly flat and fertile owing to the valley of the [[Tiber]], its topography includes part of the central [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], with the highest point in the region at [[Monte Vettore]] on the border of the Marche, at {{convert|2,476|m|0|abbr=off}}; the lowest point is [[Attigliano]], {{convert|96|m|0|abbr=off}}. It is the only Italian region having neither a coastline nor a common border with other countries. The [[comune]] of Citt\u00e0 di Castello has an exclave named Monte Ruperto within Marche. Contained within Umbria is the hamlet of [[Cospaia]], which was a tiny republic from 1440 to 1826, created by accident.\n\nUmbria is crossed by two valleys: the Umbrian valley (\"Valle Umbra\"), stretching from Perugia to Spoleto, and the Tiber Valley (\"Val Tiberina\"), north and west of the first one, from Citt\u00e0 di Castello to the border with Lazio. The Tiber River forms the approximate border with Lazio, although its source is just over the Tuscan border. The Tiber's three principal tributaries flow southward through Umbria. The [[Chiascio]] basin is relatively uninhabited as far as [[Bastia Umbra]]. About {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} farther on, it joins the Tiber at [[Torgiano]]. The [[Topino River|Topino]], cleaving the Apennines with passes that the [[Via Flaminia]] and successor roads follow, makes a sharp turn at [[Foligno]] to flow NW for a few kilometres before joining the Chiascio below [[Bettona]]. The third river is the [[Nera (Italy)|Nera]], flowing into the Tiber further south, at Terni; its valley is called the ''Valnerina''. The upper Nera cuts ravines in the mountains; the lower, in the Tiber basin, has created a wide floodplain.\n\nIn antiquity, the plain was covered by a pair of shallow, interlocking lakes, the Lacus Clitorius and the Lacus Umber. They were drained by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] over several hundred years. An earthquake in the 4th&nbsp;century and the political collapse of the Roman Empire resulted in the refilling of the basin. It was drained a second time, almost a thousand years later, during a 500-year period: [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks started the process in the 13th century, and the draining was completed by an engineer from Foligno in the 18th century.\n\nThe eastern part of the region, being crossed by many [[Fault (geology)|faults]], has been often hit by earthquakes: the last ones have been [[1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake|that of 1997]] (which hit Foligno, Assisi and [[Nocera Umbra]]) and [[October 2016 Central Italy earthquakes|those of 2016]] (which struck [[Norcia]] and the Valnerina).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Casalini|first1=Simona|title=Terremoto in Centro Italia|url=http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/10/30/news/terremoto_rieti-150898762/?ref=HREA-1|accessdate=30 October 2016|work=Repubblica|date=30 October 2016|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nIn literature, Umbria is referred to as ''Il cuore verde d'Italia'' or ''The green heart of Italy''. The phrase is taken from a poem by [[Giosu\u00e8 Carducci]], the subject of which is the source of the [[Clitunno River]] in Umbria.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Umbria}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Perugia panoramic.jpg|thumb|300px|Cityscape of the capital Perugia]]\n[[File:UmbriaPanorama.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical landscape of the Umbrian countryside]]\n[[File:Panorama-Assisi.jpg|thumb|300px|View of [[Assisi]]]]\n[[File:Norcia-panorama.jpg|300px|thumb|View of [[Norcia]]]]\n[[File:Gubbio Palazzo dei Consoli z02.jpg|thumb|right|View of the medieval town of Gubbio]]\n[[File:Orvieto-Le D\u00f4me-Fa\u00e7ade-.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Orvieto Cathedral]]]]\n===Antiquity===\nThe region is named for the [[Umbri]] people, an [[Italic people]] which was absorbed by the expansion of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Umbri's capital city was [[Gubbio]], which now houses   the longest and most important document of any of the [[Osco-Umbrian]] group of languages, the [[Iguvine Tablets]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] recounted a fanciful derivation for the tribal name from the Greek \u1f44\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"a shower\", which led to the idea that they had survived the Deluge familiar from Greek mythology, allowing them to claim to be the most ancient race in Italy.<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', 3.6; 3.19.</ref> In fact, they belonged to a broader family of neighbouring peoples with similar roots. Their language was [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]], one of the [[Italic languages]], related  to [[Latin]] and [[Oscan language|Oscan]]. The northern part of the region was occupied by [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes.\n\nThe Umbri probably sprang, like neighbouring peoples, from the creators of the [[Terramara]], and [[Proto-Villanovan culture]] in northern and central Italy, who entered north-eastern Italy at the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe [[Etruscans]] were the chief enemies of the Umbri. The Etruscan invasion extended from the western seaboard towards the north and east from about 700 to 500 BC. They eventually drove the Umbrians towards the [[Apennines|Apennine]] uplands and captured 300 Umbrian towns. Nevertheless, the Umbrian population does not seem to have been eradicated in the conquered districts. The border between Etruria and Umbria was the Tiber river, as established by the ancient name of Todi, ''Tular'' (\"border\").\n\nAfter the downfall of the Etruscans, Umbrians aided the [[Samnium|Samnite]]s in their [[Samnite Wars|struggle]] against [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (308 BC). Later communications with [[Samnium]] were impeded by the Roman fortress of [[Narni]]a (founded 298 BC). Romans defeated the Samnites and their Gallic allies in the [[battle of Sentinum]] (295 BC). Allied Umbrians and Etruscans had to return home and defend each of their territories against simultaneous Roman attacks, leaving the Samnites without their help in the battle of Sentinum.\n\nThe Roman victory at Sentinum initiated a period of integration under the Roman rulers, who established some colonies, such as [[Spoletium]], and built the [[via Flaminia]] (220 BC). The via Flaminia became a principal vector for Roman development in Umbria. During [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]]'s invasion during the [[second Punic war]], the [[battle of Lake Trasimene]] was fought in Umbria, but the local people did not aid the invader.\n\nDuring the [[Roman civil war]] between [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavian]] (40 BC), the city of Perugia supported Antony and was almost completely destroyed by Octavian. In [[Pliny the Elder]]'s time, 49 independent communities still existed in Umbria, and the abundance of inscriptions and the high proportion of recruits in the [[Roman Army|imperial army]] attest to its population. Under Augustus, Umbria became [[Roman Umbria|the Regio VI]] of Roman Italy.\n\nModern Umbria is different from [[Roman Umbria]]. Roman Umbria extended through most of what is now the northern Marche to [[Ravenna]], but excluded the west bank of the Tiber, which belonged to Etruria. Thus [[Perusia|Perugia]] was an Etruscan city and the area around Norcia was in the [[Sabine]] territory.\n\nAfter the collapse of the [[Roman empire]], [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] struggled for supremacy in the region, and the [[Battle of Taginae|decisive battle]] of the war between these two peoples took place near modern [[Gualdo Tadino]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter the Ostrogoths, the [[Lombards]] founded the [[duchy of Spoleto]], covering much of today's southern Umbria, but the Byzantine were able to keep in the region a corridor along the Via Flaminia linking Rome with the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis|Pentapolis]]. The Lombard king controlled also the northern part of the region ruled directly by Pavia. When [[Charlemagne]] conquered most of the Lombard kingdoms, some Umbrian territories were given to the Pope, who established temporal power over them. Some cities acquired a form of autonomy named ''[[Medieval commune|comune]]''.  These cities were frequently at war with each other, often in a context of more general conflicts, either between the [[Church State|Papacy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] or between the [[Guelphs]] and the [[Ghibellines]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the ''[[signoria|signorie]]'' arose and the most important of them were those of the [[Vitelli]] in [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], of the Baglioni in Perugia and of the [[Trinci]] in [[Foligno]], but the two last ones were subsumed by the middle of the same century into the [[Papal States]] by [[Cardinal (catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who in this way prepared the return of the pope from [[Avignon]] to Rome. Citt\u00e0 di Castello was subsumed later into the Papal States by [[Cesare Borgia]]. During 15th century Renaissance spread in the northern part of the region. It was in this period that humanists started to use again the ancient denomination of \"Umbria\" to name the area, which until then has been named \"Ducato\", after the [[Duchy of Spoleto]] in the southern part of it. The supremacy of the pope on Umbria was reinforced in 16th century through the erection of a fortress in Perugia by Pope [[Paul III]], named after him Rocca Paolina. The Papacy ruled the region uncontested until the end of the 18th century.\n\n===Modern history===\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] and the French conquest of Italy, Umbria became part of the ephemeral [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131799) and later, part of the [[Napoleonic Empire]] (1809\u20131814) under the name of department of [[Trasim\u00e8ne]].\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat, the Pope regained Umbria and ruled it until 1860. In that year, during Italian [[Risorgimento]], Umbria with Marche and part of Emilia Romagna were annexed by [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Piedmontese]] King [[Victor Emmanuel II]], and the people of Perugia destroyed in the same year the Rocca Paolina, symbol of the papal oppression. The region of Umbria, with capital Perugia, was part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the following year. The region, whose economy was mainly based on agriculture, experienced a dramatic economic shift at the end of the 19th century with the founding of the ''Acciaierie di Terni'', a major steelwork placed in Terni because of its abundance of electric power due to the [[Marmore]] waterfall and its secluded position.\n\nThe region of Umbria at the time was somewhat larger than today, comprising [[province of Rieti|Rieti]] to the south, now part of [[Lazio]]. Rieti was detached and added to the Province of Rome (Lazio) in 1923. In 1927, the region of Umbria was divided into the provinces of Perugia and Terni.\n\nDuring WWII, the industrial centers of the region like Terni and Foligno were heavily bombed and in 1944 became a battlefield between the allied forces and the Germans retreating towards the [[Gothic Line]]. In 1946, Umbria was incorporated into the [[Italian Republic]] as a [[regions of Italy|region]], comprising the two provinces of Perugia and Terni.\n\n== Festivals ==\n[[File:Gubbio Corsa Ceri.jpg|thumb|Corsa dei ceri, or race of the \"candles\", which are symbolized by these tall wooden poles]]\nOne of the most important festivals in Umbria is \"the festival of the Ceri (Candles)\", also known as [[Saint Ubaldo Day]] in [[Gubbio]]. The race has been held every year since 1160, on the 15th day of May. The festival is focused around a race consisting of three teams of ''cerioli'', carrying large symbolic \"candles\" topped by saints, including St. [[Ubald]] (the patron saint of Gubbio), S. Giorgio ([[St. George]]), and S. Antonio ([[Anthony the Great]]), and run through throngs of cheering supporters.  The cerioli are clad in the distinctive colors of yellow, blue or black, according to the saint they support, with white trousers and red belts and neckbands. They travel up much of the mountain from the main square in front of the ''Palazzo dei Consoli'' to the basilica of St. Ubaldo, each team carrying a statue of their saint mounted on a wooden octagonal prism, similar to an hour-glass shape 4 metres tall and weighing about 280&nbsp;kg (617&nbsp;lb).\n\nThe race has strong devotional, civic, and historical overtones and is one of the best-known folklore manifestations in Italy, and therefore the Ceri were chosen as the heraldic emblem on the coat of arms of Umbria as a modern administrative region.\n\nUmbria is not only known for its historical recollections such as the festival of the Ceri, Calendimaggio, but also for one of the biggest jazz music festivals called Umbria Jazz. Umbria Jazz was born as a festival in 1973 and since 2003 has been held in the Umbrian capital \"Perugia\" in July; it has become the fixed appointment of all jazz and good music lovers.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe present economic structure emerged from a series of transformations which took place mainly in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, there was rapid expansion among small and medium-sized firms and a gradual retrenchment among the large firms which had hitherto characterised the region's industrial base. This process of structural adjustment is still going on.<ref name=\"circa.europa.eu\">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/ite2_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |website=Circa.europa.eu |accessdate=24 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721131757/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/ite2_eco.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEconomically the most important region is the upper Tiber valley with [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]]. [[Terni]] steelworks (stainless steel, titanium, alloy steel) and processing companies (automotive, stainless steel tubes, industrial food facility) account for 20 to 25 % of Umbria's GDP. In Terni there are also many multinational companies in the fields of chemistry, hydroelectric power, renewable sources of energy, and textiles ([[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]]). In the rest of the region the ornamental ceramics industry is much esteemed.<ref name=\"circa.europa.eu\"/>\n\nUmbrian agriculture is noted for its tobacco, [[olive oil]] and vineyards, which produce excellent wines. Regional varietals include the white [[Orvieto]], which draws agri-tourists to the vineyards in the area surrounding the medieval town of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/sagrantino-di-montalfalco-umbria-comes-best-red-wine-you-never-tasted|title=Sagrantino di Montefalco: From Umbria Comes The Best Red Wine You Never Tasted!|website=IntoWine.com|date=2 July 2007}}</ref> A notable wine is the Grechetto<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.umbriatourism.it/en_US/-/grechetto-di-todi|title=Grechetto di Todi|website=www.umbriatourism.it|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref> of [[Todi]].
