He then moved to Spain, where he worked as a clerk at an air base.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> \n\nIn 1962, he wrote a series of 37 articles on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing campaign]], ''Und Deutschlands St\u00e4dte starben nicht'' (''And Germany's Cities Did Not Die''), for the German [[boulevard journalism|boulevard journal]] ''Neue Illustrierte''. These were the basis for his first book, ''[[The Destruction of Dresden]]'' (1963), in which he examined the Allied [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945. By the 1960s, a debate about the morality of the [[carpet bombing]] of German cities and civilian population had already begun, especially in the United Kingdom. There was consequently considerable interest in Irving's book, which was illustrated with graphic pictures, and it became an international [[best-seller]].\n\nIn the first edition, Irving's estimates for deaths in [[Dresden]] were between 100,000 and 250,000 \u2013 notably higher than most previously published figures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=225\u2013226}}.</ref> These figures became authoritative and widely accepted in many standard reference works. In later editions of the book over the next three decades, he gradually adjusted the figure downwards to 50,000\u2013100,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=43}}.</ref> According to [[Richard J. Evans]] at the 2000 libel trial that Irving brought against [[Deborah Lipstadt]], Irving based his estimates of the dead of Dresden on the word of one individual who provided no supporting documentation, used forged documents, and described one witness who was a [[urologist]] as Dresden's Deputy Chief Medical Officer. The doctor later complained about being misidentified by Irving, and further, that he, the doctor, was only repeating rumours about the death toll.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=225}}.</ref>\n\nThe number of deaths in the bombing raids may never be known. The presence in the city of over 100,000 refugees fleeing the advance of the Red Army means there is no accurate record of them. Two tourist books, one written by Herbert Wotte and Siegfried Hoyer, published in 1978, give the casualties as 35,000; another compiled by Jurgen Rach and Erwin and Inge Hartsche (1977), agrees with this figure. The [[East Germany|DDR]] officially accepted figure was \"a minimum of 35,000 dead\". Alexander McKee looked at other firebombings of German cities, notably Hamburg, and concluded that \"the figure of 35,000 for one night's massacre alone might easily be doubled to 70,000 without much fear of exaggeration, because of the exodus of refugees from Silesia.\"<ref>McKee, Alexander, ''Dresden 1945'', Granada Publishing Ltd., UK, 1983, pps:369\u2013370. {{ISBN|0-583-13686-9}}</ref> However, according to an investigation by Dresden City Council in 2008, casualties at Dresden were estimated as 22,700\u201325,000 dead.<ref>Seeking to establish a definitive casualty figure, an independent investigation (commissioned by the Dresden city council), ended in 2010 drawing a conclusion that a maximum of 25,000 people were killed, of which 22,700 deaths have been positively identified\u201420,100 named and a further 2,600 unnamed ({{Citation|date=10 January 2008 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26977893 |title=Report: Dresden bombing deaths overestimated |publisher=NBC News}};  {{in lang|de}} {{Citation  |date=15 April 2010  |url=http://www.sz-online.de/Nachrichten/Freital/?etag=15.04.2010 |title=Mindestzahl der Dresdner Bombenopfer nach oben korrigiert (lowest number of Dresden raids casualties corrected upwards|newspaper=[[S\u00e4chsische Zeitung]]}} {{subscription}}).</ref>\n\nIrving had based his numbers on what purported to be \"TB 47\", a document promulgated by Nazi Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], and on claims made after the war by a former Dresden Nazi functionary, Hans Voigt, without verifying them against official sources available in Dresden. Irving's estimates and sources were first disputed by [[Walter Weidauer]], Mayor of Dresden 1946\u20131958, in his own account of the Dresden bombing. When it was later confirmed that the TB 47 used was a forgery, Irving published a letter to the editor in ''[[The Times]]'' on 7 July 1966 retracting his estimates, writing that he had \"no interest in promoting or perpetuating false legends\".

[[Michael J.

In the latter book, Irving claimed that the plane crash which killed  [[Polish government in exile]] leader General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] in 1943 was really an assassination ordered by [[Winston Churchill]], so as to enable Churchill to betray Poland to the [[Soviet Union]]. Irving's book inspired the highly controversial 1967 play  ''[[Soldiers (play)|Soldiers]]'' by his friend, the German playwright [[Rolf Hochhuth]], where Hochhuth depicts Churchill ordering the assassination of General Sikorski.\n\nAlso in 1967, Irving published two more works: ''The Virus House'', an account of the [[German nuclear energy project]] for which Irving conducted many interviews,<ref name=\"Virus House research\"/> and ''The Destruction of Convoy PQ-17,'' in which he blamed the British escort group commander, Commander [[Jack Broome]] for the catastrophic losses of the [[Convoy PQ 17]]. Amid much publicity, Broome sued Irving for libel in October 1968, and in February 1970, after a 17 day-trial before London's [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], Broome won. Irving was forced to pay \u00a340,000 in damages, and the book was withdrawn from circulation.\n\nAfter ''PQ-17'', Irving largely shifted to writing biographies. In 1968, he published ''Breach of Security'', an account of German reading of messages to and from the British Embassy in Berlin before 1939 with an introduction by the British historian [[Donald Cameron Watt]]. As a result of Irving's success with ''Dresden'', members of Germany's extreme right wing assisted him in contacting surviving members of Hitler's inner circle. In an interview with the American journalist [[Ron Rosenbaum]], Irving claimed to have developed sympathies towards them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|pp=227\u2013229}}.</ref> Many ageing former mid- and high-ranked Nazis saw a potential friend in Irving and donated diaries and other material. Irving described his historical work to Rosenbaum as an act of \"stone-cleaning\" of Hitler, in which he cleared off the \"slime\" that he felt had been unjustly applied to Hitler's reputation.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum 232\" />\n\nIn 1969, during a visit to Germany, Irving met [[Robert Kempner]], one of the American prosecutors at the [[Nuremberg trials]].<ref name=\"Lipstadt 293\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=293}}.</ref> Irving asked Kempner if the \"official record of the Nuremberg Trials was falsified\", and told him that he was planning to go to Washington, D.C., to compare the sound recordings of Luftwaffe Field-Marshal [[Erhard Milch]]'s March 1946 evidence with the subsequently published texts to find proof that evidence given at Nuremberg was \"tampered with and manipulated\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|pp=293\u2013294}}.</ref> Upon his return to the United States, Kempner wrote to [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], that Irving expressed many \"anti-American and anti-Jewish statements\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 293\" />\n\nIn 1971, Irving translated the memoirs of General [[Reinhard Gehlen]], and in 1973 published ''The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe'', a biography of Field Marshal Milch. He spent the remainder of the 1970s working on ''[[Hitler's War]]'' and ''The War Path'', his two-part biography of Adolf Hitler; ''The Trail of the Fox,'' a biography of Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]; and a series in the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' describing the [[Royal Air Force]]'s famous [[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]] raid. In 1975, in his introduction to ''Hitler und seine Feldherren'', the German edition of ''Hitler's War'', Irving attacked [[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank's diary]] as a forgery, claiming falsely that a New York court had ruled that the diary was really the work of American scriptwriter [[Meyer Levin]] \"in collaboration with the girl's father\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=232}}.</ref>\n\n==Revisionism==\n\n===''Hitler's War''===\n{{main|Hitler's War}}\n\nIn 1977 Irving published ''[[Hitler's War]]'', the first of his two-part biography of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Irving's intention in ''Hitler's War'' was to clean away the \"years of grime and discoloration from the facade of a silent and forbidding monument\" to reveal the real Hitler, whose reputation Irving argued had been slandered by historians.<ref name=\"Craig 72\">{{Harvnb|Craig|1982|p=72}}.</ref> In ''Hitler's War'', Irving tried to \"view the situation as far as possible through Hitler's eyes, from behind his desk\".<ref name=\"Craig 72\" /> He portrayed Hitler as a rational, intelligent politician, whose only goal was to increase Germany's prosperity and influence on the continent, and who was constantly let down by incompetent or treasonous subordinates.<ref name=\"Craig 72\" /> Irving's book faulted the Allied leaders, especially [[Winston Churchill]], for the eventual escalation of war, and argued that the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941 was a \"[[preventive war]]\" forced on Hitler to avert an impending Soviet attack.<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\">{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=166 n. 20}}.</ref> He also argued that Hitler had no knowledge of [[the Holocaust]]: while not denying its occurrence, Irving argued that [[Heinrich Himmler]] and his deputy [[Reinhard Heydrich]] were its originators and architects. Irving made much of the lack of any written order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust, and for decades afterward offered to pay \u00a31,000 to anyone who could find such an order.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 46\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nCritical reaction to ''Hitler's War'' was generally negative. Reviewers took issue with Irving's factual claims as well as his conclusions. For example, American historian Charles Sydnor noted numerous errors in ''Hitler's War'', such as Irving's unreferenced statement that the Jews who fought in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943 were well supplied with weapons from Germany's allies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979| p=179}}</ref> Sydnor pointed out that Hitler had received an SS report in November 1942 which contained a mention of 363,211 Russian Jews executed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' between August and November 1942.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979| pp=182\u2013183}}</ref> Sydnor remarked that Irving's statement that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in charge in the [[Extermination camp|death camps]] seems to indicate that he was not familiar with the history of the Holocaust, as the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in fact mobile death squads who had nothing to do with the death camps.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979 |p=176}}</ref>\n\n===Irving's work of the late 1970s and early 1980s===\nJust months after the initial release of ''Hitler's War'', Irving published ''The Trail of the Fox'', a biography of [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]]. In it, Irving attacked the members of the [[20 July Plot]] to assassinate Hitler, branding them \"traitors\", \"cowards\", and \"manipulators\", and uncritically presented Hitler and his government's subsequent revenge against the plotters, of which Rommel was also a victim. In particular, Irving accused Rommel's friend and Chief of Staff General [[Hans Speidel]] of framing Rommel in the attempted coup. The British historian [[David Pryce-Jones]] in a book review of ''The Trail of the Fox'' in the edition of 12 November 1977 of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' accused Irving of taking everything Hitler had to say at face value.<ref name=\"adl profile\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Irving released ''The War Path'', the companion volume to ''Hitler's War'' which covered events leading up to the war and which was written from a similar point of view. Again, professional historians such as Donald Cameron Watt noted numerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Despite the criticism, the book sold well, as did all of Irving's books to that date. The financial success of his books enabled Irving to buy a home in the prestigious [[Mayfair]] district of London, own a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] car, and to enjoy a very affluent lifestyle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=52}}.</ref> In addition, Irving, despite being married, became increasingly open about his affairs with other women, all of which were detailed in his self-published diary.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 51\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=51}}.</ref> Irving's affairs were to cause his first marriage to end in divorce in 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, Irving started researching and writing about topics other than Nazi Germany, but with less success. He began his research on his three-part biography of [[Winston Churchill]]. After publication Irving's work on Churchill received at least one bad review from Professor [[David Cannadine]] (then of the [[University of London]]):\n\n{{quote|It has received almost no attention from historians or reviewers ... It is easy to see why ... full of excesses, inconsistencies and omissions ... seems completely unaware of recent work done on the subject ... It is not merely that the arguments in this book are so perversely tendentious and irresponsibly sensationalist. It is also that it is written in a tone which is at best casually journalistic and at worst quite exceptionally offensive.

The first was ''The War Between the Generals'', in which Irving offered an account of the Allied High Command on the Western Front in 1944\u201345, detailing the heated conflicts Irving alleges occurred between the various generals of the various countries and presenting rumours about their private lives. The second book was ''Uprising!'', about the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|1956 revolt in Hungary]], which Irving characterised as \"primarily an anti-Jewish uprising\", supposedly because the Communist regime was itself controlled by Jews. Irving's depiction of Hungary's Communist regime as a Jewish dictatorship oppressing [[Gentiles]] sparked charges of [[antisemitism]].<ref name=\"Guttenplan 47\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=47}}.</ref> In addition, there were complaints that Irving had grossly exaggerated the number of people of Jewish origin in the Communist regime and had ignored the fact that [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] Communists who did have a Jewish background like [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]] had totally repudiated Judaism and sometimes expressed antisemitic attitudes themselves.<ref name=\"observer 1981\"/> Critics such as [[Neal Ascherson]] and [[Kai Bird]] took issue with some of Irving's language that seemed to evoke antisemitic imagery, such as his remark that R\u00e1kosi possessed \"the tact of a [[kosher]] butcher\".<ref name=\"Guttenplan 47\" />\n\n===Hitler Diaries===\nIn 1983, ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', a weekly German news magazine, purchased 61 volumes of [[Hitler Diaries|Hitler's supposed diaries]] for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 9 million and published excerpts from them. Irving played the main role in exposing the Hitler Diaries as a hoax. In October 1982 Irving had purchased, from the same source as ''Stern'''s 1983 purchase, 800 pages of documents relating to Hitler, only to conclude that many of the documents were forgeries.<ref name=\"Evans 2001 19\">{{Harvnb|Evans|2001|p=19}}.</ref> Irving was amongst the first to identify the diaries as forgeries, and to draw media attention. He went so far as to crash the press conference held by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] at the [[Hamburg]] offices of ''Stern'' magazine on 25 April 1983 to denounce the diaries as a forgery and Trevor-Roper for endorsing the diaries as genuine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=48}}.</ref> Irving's performance at the ''Stern'' press conference where he violently harangued Trevor-Roper until ejected by security led him to be featured prominently on the news: the next day, Irving appeared on the ''Today'' television show as a featured guest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1986|pp=320\u2013323}}.</ref> Irving had concluded that the alleged Hitler diaries were a forgery because they had come from the same dealer in Nazi memorabilia from whom Irving had purchased his collection in 1982.<ref name=\"Evans 2001 19\" /> At the press conference in Hamburg, Irving said, \"I know the collection from which these diaries come. It is an old collection, full of forgeries. I have some here\".<ref name=\"Evans 2001 19\" /> Irving was proud to have detected and denounced the hoax material and of the \"trail of chaos\" he had created at the Hamburg press conference and the attendant publicity it had brought him, and took pride in his humiliation of Trevor-Roper, whom Irving strongly disliked for his sloppy work, in not detecting the hoax, and past criticism of Irving's methods and conclusions.<ref name=\"Pelt 22\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=22}}.</ref> Irving also noted internal inconsistencies in the supposed Hitler diaries, such as a diary entry for [[July 20 plot|July 20, 1944]], which would have been unlikely given that Hitler's right hand had been badly burned by the bomb planted in his headquarters by Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=19}}.</ref>\n\nA week later on 2 May, Irving asserted that many of the diary documents appear to be genuine: at the same press conference, Irving took the opportunity to promote his translation of the memoirs of Hitler's physician Dr. [[Theodor Morell]].<ref name=\"Pelt 22\" /> [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], in his book ''Selling Hitler'', suggested that an additional reason for Irving's change of mind over the authenticity of the alleged Hitler diaries was that the fake diaries contain no reference to the Holocaust, thereby buttressing Irving's claim in ''Hitler's War'' that Hitler had no knowledge of it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1986|pp=338\u2013339}}.</ref> Subsequently, Irving conformed when the diaries were declared a forgery by consensus. At a press conference held to withdraw his endorsement of the diaries, Irving proudly claimed that he was the first to call them a forgery, to which a reporter replied that he was also the last to call them genuine.<ref name=\"Pelt 22\" />\n\n===Other books===\nBy the mid-1980s, Irving had not had a successful book for some years, and was behind schedule in writing the first volume of his Churchill series, the research for which had strained his finances.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 56\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=56}}.</ref> He finished the manuscript in 1985, but the book was not published until 1987, when it was released as ''Churchill's War, Volume I''.\n\nIn 1989, Irving published his biography of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].\n\n==Holocaust denial==\n\n===Movement towards Holocaust denial===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99621, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''Reichsf\u00fchrer''-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]]. A note in Himmler's telephone log from 30 November 1941 saying \"no liquidation\" was later used by Irving as the central argument trying to prove that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust.]]\nOver the years, Irving's stance on the Holocaust changed significantly. From 1988, he started to espouse [[Holocaust denial]] openly: he had previously not denied the Holocaust outright and for this reason, many Holocaust deniers were ambivalent about him.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=21}}.</ref> They admired Irving for the pro-Nazi slant in his work and the fact that he possessed a degree of mainstream credibility that they lacked, but were annoyed that he did not openly deny the Holocaust. In 1980, [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] noted that, although ''Hitler's War'' was strongly sympathetic to the Third Reich, because Irving argued that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust as opposed to denying the Holocaust happened at all, his book was not part of the \"anti-Semitic canon\".<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy \"Lies About the Holocaust\" pages 31\u201337 from ''Commentary'', Volume 70, Issue # 6, p. 35</ref> In 1980, Irving received an invitation to speak at a Holocaust-denial conference, which he refused on the grounds that his appearance there would damage his reputation.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> In a letter, Irving stated his reasons for his refusal as: \"This is pure ''[[Realpolitik]]'' on my part. I am already dangerously exposed, and I cannot take the chance of being caught in flak meant for others!\"<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> Though Irving refused at this time to appear at conferences sponsored by the Holocaust-denying [[Institute for Historical Review]] (IHR), he did grant the institute the right to distribute his books in the United States.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] suggests that the major reason for Irving wishing to keep his distance from Holocaust deniers in the early 1980s was his desire to found his own political party called Focus.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" />\n\nIn a footnote in the first edition of ''Hitler's War'', Irving writes, \"I cannot accept the view...  [that] there exists no document signed by Hitler, Himmler or [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]] speaking of the extermination of the Jews\". In 1982, Irving temporarily stopped writing and made an attempt to unify all of the various far-right splinter groups in Britain into one party called Focus, in which he would play a leading role.<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> Irving described himself as a \"moderate fascist\" and spoke of plans to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]],<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=161}}.</ref> but his efforts to move into politics, which Irving regarded at the time as very important, failed due to fiscal problems.<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> Irving told the ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' of having \"links at a low level\" with the [[National Front (UK)|British National Front]].<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> Irving described ''[[The Spotlight]]'', the main journal of the [[Liberty Lobby]], as \"an excellent fortnightly paper\".<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> At the same time, Irving put a copy of Hitler's \"Prophecy Speech\" of 30 January 1939, promising the \"annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\" if \"Jewish financiers\" started another world war, onto his wall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=167}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing the failure of Focus, in September 1983, Irving for the first time attended a conference of the IHR.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> Van Pelt has argued that, with the failure of Irving's political career, he felt freer to associate with Holocaust deniers.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> At the conference, Irving did not deny the Holocaust, but did appear happy to share the stage with [[Robert Faurisson]] and Judge [[Wilhelm St\u00e4glich]], and claimed to be impressed with the allegations of Friedrich Berg that [[mass murder]] using [[Diesel fuel|diesel gas fumes]] at the [[Operation Reinhard]] death camps was impossible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|pp=22\u201323}}.</ref> At that conference, Irving repeated his claims that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust because he was \"so busy being a soldier\".<ref name=\"Pelt 23\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=23}}.</ref> In a speech at that conference, Irving stated: \"Isn't it right for Tel Aviv to claim now that David Irving is talking nonsense and ''of course'' Adolf Hitler must have known about what was going in Auschwitz and Treblinka, and then in the same breath to claim that, ''of course'' our beloved [[Menachem Begin|Mr. Begin]] didn't know what was going on in [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Chatilla]]\".<ref name=\"Pelt 23\" /> During the same speech, Irving proclaimed Hitler to be the \"biggest friend the Jews had in the Third Reich\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 162\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=162}}.</ref> In the same speech, Irving stated that he operated in such a way as to bring himself maximum publicity. Irving stated that: \"I have at home... a filing cabinet full of documents which I don't issue all at once. I keep them: I issue them a bit at a time. When I think my name hasn't been in the newspapers for several weeks, well, then I ring them up and I phone them and I say: 'What about this one, then?'\"<ref name=\"Pelt 23\" />\n\nA major theme of Irving's writings from the 1980s was his belief that it had been a great blunder on the part of Britain to declare war on Germany in 1939, and that ever since then and as a result of that decision, Britain had slipped into an unstoppable decline.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> Irving also took the view that Hitler often tried to help the Jews of Europe.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> In a June 1992 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Irving claimed to have heard from Hitler's naval adjutant that the ''F\u00fchrer'' had told him that he could not marry because Germany was \"his bride\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> Irving then claimed to have asked the naval adjutant when Hitler made that remark, and upon hearing that the date was 24 March 1938, Irving stated in response \"Herr Admiral, at that moment I was being born\". Irving used this alleged incident to argue that there was some sort of mystical connection between himself and Hitler.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161-162\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|pp=161\u2013162}}.</ref>\n\nIn a 1986 speech in Australia Irving argued that photographs of Holocaust survivors and dead taken in early 1945 by Allied soldiers were proof that the Allies were responsible for the Holocaust, not the Germans.<ref name=\"Pelt 40\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=40}}.</ref> Irving claimed that the Holocaust was not the work of Nazi leaders, but rather of \"nameless criminals\",<ref name=\"Pelt 40\" /> and claimed that \"these men [who killed the Jews] acted on their own impulse, their own initiative, within the general atmosphere of brutality created by the Second World War, in which of course Allied bombings played a part.\"<ref name=\"Pelt 40\" /> In another 1986 speech, this time in [[Atlanta]], Irving claimed that \"historians have a blindness when it comes to the Holocaust because like [[Tay\u2013Sachs disease]] it is a Jewish disease which causes blindness\".<ref name=s32>{{Harvnb|Stern |1992 |p=32}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Irving associated himself with the IHR, began giving lectures to groups such as the far-right German [[Deutsche Volksunion]] (DVU), and publicly denied that the Nazis systematically exterminated Jews in gas chambers during World War II.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 8\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=8}}.</ref> Irving was present at a memorial service for [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] in January 1983 after the latter's death, organised by the DVU and Frey, delivering a speech,<ref>{{cite news |date=9 January 1983|title=Big crowd commemorates death of Nazi pilot|trans-title=|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/09/Big-crowd-commemorates-death-of-Nazi-pilot/7256410936400/|language=|work=[[United Press International]]|location= |access-date=27 November 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gedenkveranstaltung f\u00fcr Hans Ulrich Rudel, 1983|trans-title=Memorial service for Hans Ulrich Rudel, 1983|url=https://www.sz-photo.de/?16607724099100603390&EVENT=POPUP&WINDOW=WGWINe4704873e01b6fac8cb1c19fdf7143a9&AJXUID=0.7987179042092476&MEDIANUMBER=00325558&MEDIAITEMS=667e82876af943c49f10de114a6d270cc7811f83&OMG=fde34952c756&PAGING_SCOPE_4=29&MEDIAGROUP_SCOPE=1|language=German|work=[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]|location= |access-date=28 November 2018 }}</ref> and was given the Hans-Ulrich-Rudel-Award by Frey in June 1985.<ref>{{cite web |title=Funke: David Irving, Holocaust denial, and his connections to right wing extremists and neo-national socialism (neo-nazism) in Germany|trans-title=|url=https://www.hdot.org/funke/|language=|work=[[Emory University]]|location= |access-date=27 November 2018 }}</ref> Irving was a frequent speaker for the DVU in the 1980s and the early 1990s, but the relationship ended in 1993 apparently because of concerns by the DVU that Irving's espousal of Holocaust denial might lead to the DVU being banned.<ref name=\"adl profile\"/>\n\nIn 1986, Irving visited Toronto, where he was met at the airport by Holocaust denier [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]].<ref name=\"Pelt 41\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=41}}.</ref> According to Z\u00fcndel, Irving \"thought I was 'Revisionist-Neo-Nazi-Rambo-Kook!'\", and asked Z\u00fcndel to stay away from him.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\" /> Z\u00fcndel and his supporters obliged Irving by staying away from his lecture tour, which consequently attracted little media attention, and was considered by Irving to be a failure.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\" /> Afterwards, Z\u00fcndel sent Irving a long letter in which he offered to draw publicity to Irving, and so ensure that his future speaking tours would be a success.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\"/> As a result, Irving and Z\u00fcndel became friends, and Irving agreed in late 1987 to testify for Z\u00fcndel at his second trial for denying the Holocaust.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=42}}.</ref> In addition, the publication in 1987 of the book ''Der europ\u00e4ische B\u00fcrgerkrieg 1917\u20131945'' by [[Ernst Nolte]], in which Nolte strongly implied that maybe Holocaust deniers were on to something, encouraged Irving to become more open in associating with Z\u00fcndel.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\" />\n\n===Z\u00fcndel trial===\nIn January 1988, Irving travelled to Toronto, Ontario, to assist [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Douglas Christie]], the defence lawyer for [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] at his [[R. v.

He also expressed his evolving belief that the Final Solution involved \"[[war crimes|atrocities]]\", not systematic murder: \"I don't think there was any overall ''Reich'' policy to kill the Jews. If there was, they would have been killed and there would not be now so many millions of survivors. And believe me, I am glad for every survivor that there was.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihr.org/books/kulaszka/35irving.html |title=The 'False News' Trial of Ernst Z\u00fcndel \u2013 1988: David Irving |publisher=Ihr.org |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> On 22\u201326 April 1988, Irving testified for Z\u00fcndel, endorsing [[Richard Verrall|Richard Harwood]]'s book ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' as \"over ninety percent... factually accurate\".<ref name=\"Pelt 44\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=44}}.</ref>\n\nAs to what evidence further led Irving to believe that the Holocaust never occurred, he cited ''The [[Leuchter report]]'' by Fred A. Leuchter, which claimed there was no evidence for the existence of homicidal [[gas chamber]]s at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Irving said in a 1999 documentary about Leuchter: \"The big point [of the Leuchter report]: there is no significant residue of [[cyanide]] in the brickwork. That's what converted me. When I read that in the report in the courtroom in Toronto, I became a hard-core disbeliever\".<ref>''Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.''.</ref> In addition, Irving was influenced to embrace Holocaust denial by the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]]'s 1988 book ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'', which did not deny the Holocaust, but claimed that most of those who died at Auschwitz were killed by disease: Irving saw in Mayer's book an apparent confirmation of Leuchter's and Z\u00fcndel's theories about no mass murder at Auschwitz.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|pp=47\u201348}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the trial, Irving published Leuchter's report as ''Auschwitz The End of the Line: The Leuchter Report'' in the United Kingdom in 1989 and wrote its foreword.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> Leuchter's book had been first published in Canada by Z\u00fcndel's [[Samisdat Publishers]] in 1988 as ''The Leuchter Report: The End of a Myth: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=260}}.</ref> In his foreword to the British edition of Leuchter's book, Irving wrote that \"Nobody likes to be swindled, still less where considerable sums of money are involved\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> The alleged swindle was the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations]] money totalling 3 billion DM paid by the Federal Republic of Germany to Israel between 1952\u20131966 for the Holocaust. Irving described the reparations as being \"essentially in atonement for the 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz\", which Irving called a \"myth\" that would \"not die easily\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> In his foreword, Irving praised the \"scrupulous methods\" and \"integrity\" of Leuchter.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" />\n\nFor publishing and writing the foreword to ''Auschwitz The End of the Line'', on 20 June 1989 Irving together with Leuchter was condemned in an [[Early Day Motion]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as \"Hitler's heirs\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|pp=179\u2013180}}.</ref> The motion went on to describe Irving as a \"Nazi propagandist and longtime Hitler apologist\" and ''Auschwitz The End of the Line'' as a \"fascist publication\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 180\" /> In the Motion, the House stated that they were \"appalled by [the Holocaust denial of] Nazi propagandist and long-time Hitler apologist David Irving\".<ref name=s32/> In response to the House of Commons motion, Irving in a press statement challenged the MPs who voted to condemn him, writing that: \"I will enter the 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz and you and your friends may lob in [[Zyklon B]] in accordance with the well known procedures and conditions. I guarantee that you won't be satisfied with the results!\".<ref name=\"Brinks, Jan Hermann page 107\">Brinks, Jan Hermann ''Children of a New Fatherland'', London: I.B.

They did not exist \u2013 ever \u2013 except perhaps as the brainchild of Britain's brilliant wartime Psychological Warfare Executive\".<ref name=\"Pelt 48\" /> Finally, Irving claimed \"the survivors of Auschwitz are themselves testimony to the absence of an extermination programme\".<ref name=\"Pelt 48\" /> Echoing the criticism of the House of Commons, a leader in ''[[The Times]]'' on 14 May 1990 described Irving as a \"man for whom Hitler is something of a hero and almost everything of an innocent and for whom Auschwitz is a Jewish deception\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 180\" />\n\n[[File:Aushwitz I gas chamber memorial.jpg|thumb|275px|Interior of the gas chamber of Auschwitz I camp.

There have been only mock-ups built by the Poles in the years after the war.\"<ref name=\"Pelt 55\" />]]\n\n===Holocaust denial lecture circuit===\nIn the early 1990s, Irving was a frequent visitor to Germany, where he spoke at neo-Nazi rallies.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 8\" /> The chief themes of Irving's German speeches were that the Allies and Axis states were equally culpable for war crimes, that the decision of [[Neville Chamberlain]] to declare war on Germany in 1939, and that of [[Winston Churchill]] to continue the war in 1940, had been great mistakes that set Britain on a path of decline, and the Holocaust was just a \"propaganda exercise\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 8\" /> In June 1990, Irving visited [[East Germany]] on a well-publicized tour entitled \"An Englishman Fights for the Honour of the Germans,\" on which he accused the Allies of having used \"forged documents\" to \"humiliate\" the German people.<ref name=\"Brinks, Jan Hermann page 107\"/> Irving's self-proclaimed mission was to guide \"promising young men\" in Germany in the \"right direction\" (Irving has often stated his belief that women exist for a \"certain task, which is producing us [men]\", and should be \"subservient to men\": leading, in Lipstadt's view, to a lack of interest on Irving's part in guiding young German women in the \"right direction\").<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 16\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=16}}.</ref> German nationalists found Irving, as a non-German Holocaust denier, to be particularly credible.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 16\" />\n\nIn January 1990, Irving gave a speech in [[Moers]] where he asserted that only 30,000 people died at Auschwitz between 1940\u201345, all of natural causes, which was equal\u2014so he claimed\u2014to the typical death toll from one Bomber Command raid on German cities.<ref name=\"Pelt 55\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=55}}.</ref> Irving claimed that there were no gas chambers at the death camp, stating that the existing remains were \"mock-ups built by the Poles\".<ref name=\"Pelt 55\" /> On 21 April 1990, Irving repeated the same speech in [[Munich]], which led to his conviction for Holocaust denial in Munich on 11 July 1991. The court fined Irving DM 7,000. Irving appealed against the judgement, and received a fine of DM 10,000 for repeating the same remarks in the courtroom on 5 May 1992.<ref name=\"Pelt 55\" /> During his appeal in 1992, Irving called upon those present in the Munich courtroom to \"fight a battle for the German people and put an end to the blood lie of the Holocaust which has been told against this country for fifty years\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> Irving went on to call the Auschwitz death camp a \"tourist attraction\" whose origins Irving claimed went back to an \"ingenious plan\" devised by the British Psychological Warfare Executive in 1942 to spread anti-German propaganda that it was the policy of the German state to be \"using 'gas chambers' to kill millions of Jews and other undesirables\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> During the same speech, Irving denounced the judge as a \"[[senile]], alcoholic cretin\".<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\">{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=50}}.</ref> Following his conviction for Holocaust denial, Irving was banned from visiting Germany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=221}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Auschwitz Birkenau German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940-1945)-107820.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Inside a barracks in [[Auschwitz II Birkenau]]. In 1992 during his appeal for his conviction for Holocaust denial, Irving called Auschwitz a \"tourist attraction\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\"/>]]\n\nExpanding upon his thesis in ''Hitler's War'' about the lack of a written ''F\u00fchrer'' order for the Holocaust, Irving argued in the 1990s that the absence of such an order meant that there was no Holocaust.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum 233\">{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=233}}.</ref> In a speech delivered in Toronto in November 1990 Irving claimed that Holocaust survivors had manufactured memories of their suffering because \"there's money involved and they can get a good compensation cash payment out of it\".<ref name=\"adl profile\"/> In that speech, Irving used the metaphor of a cruise ship named Holocaust, which Irving claimed had \"...{{nbsp}}luxury wall to wall fitted carpets and a crew of thousands ...  marine terminals established in now virtually every capital in the world, disguised as Holocaust memorial museums\".<ref name=\"Pelt 57\" /> Irving went on to assert that the \"ship\" was due for rough sailing because recently the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government had allowed historians access to \"the index cards of all the people who passed through the gates of Auschwitz\", and claimed that this would lead to \"a lot of people [who] are not claiming to be Auschwitz survivors anymore\" (Irving's statement about the index cards was incorrect: what the Soviet government had made available in 1990 were the death books of Auschwitz, recording the weekly death tolls).<ref name=\"Pelt 57\" /> Irving claimed on the basis of what he called the index books that, \"Because the experts can look at a tattoo and say 'Oh yes, 181, 219 that means you entered Auschwitz in March 1943\" and he warned Auschwitz survivors \"If you want to go and have a tattoo put on your arm, as a lot of them do, I am afraid to say, and claim subsequently that you were in Auschwitz, you have to make sure a) that it fits in with the month you said you went to Auschwitz and b) it is not a number which anyone used before\".<ref name=\"Pelt 57\" />\n\nOn 17 January 1991, Irving told a reporter from ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' that \"The Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time\".<ref name=s33>{{Harnvb|Stern|1992|p=33}}</ref> Irving went on to say that he believed anti-Semitism will increase all over the world because \"the Jews have exploited people with the gas chamber legend\" and that \"In ten years, Israel will cease to exist and the Jews will have to return to Europe\".<ref name=s33/> In his 1991 revised edition of ''Hitler's War'', he had removed all references to [[death camp]]s and the Holocaust. In a speech given in [[Hamburg]] in 1991, Irving stated that in two years' time \"this myth of mass murders of Jews in the death factories of Auschwitz, [[Majdanek]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] ... which in fact never took place\" will be disproved (Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka were all well established as being [[extermination camp]]s).<ref name=\"Rosenbaum 222\">{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=222}}.</ref> Two days later, Irving repeated the same speech in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] before a group of neo-Nazis, and praised [[Rudolf Hess]] as \"that great German martyr, Rudolf Hess\".<ref name=\"Rosenbaum 222\" /> At another 1991 speech, this time in Canada, Irving called the Holocaust a \"hoax\", and again predicted that by 1993 the \"hoax\" would have been \"exposed\".<ref name=\"Pelt 57\" /> In that speech, Irving declared, \"Gradually the word is getting around Germany. Two years from now too, the German historians will accept that we are right. They will accept that for fifty years they have believed a lie\".<ref name=\"Pelt 57\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=57}}.</ref> During that speech given in October 1991, Irving expressed his contempt and hatred for Holocaust survivors by proclaiming that:\n\n<blockquote>Ridicule alone isn't enough, you've got to be tasteless about it. You've got to say things like 'More women died on the back seat of [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]]'s car at [[Chappaquiddick incident|Chappaquiddick]] than in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.' Now you think that's tasteless, what about this? I'm forming an association especially dedicated to all these liars, the ones who try and kid people that they were in these concentration camps, it's called the Auschwitz Survivors, Survivors of the Holocaust and Other Liars, 'ASSHOLs'. Can't get more tasteless than that, but you've got to be tasteless because these people deserve our contempt.</blockquote>\n\nIn another 1991 speech, this time in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], Irving called the Holocaust \"a major fraud... There were no gas chambers. They were fakes and frauds\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Stern|1992|p=48}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1992, Irving was to be a featured speaker at a world [[anti zionism|anti-Zionist]] congress in [[Stockholm]] that was cancelled by the Swedish government.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 8\" /> Also scheduled to attend were fellow Holocaust-deniers [[Robert Faurisson]] and [[Fred A. Leuchter]], and [[Louis Farrakhan]], together with representatives of the militant Palestinian group [[Hamas]], the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] militant [[Shiite]] group [[Hezbollah]], and the right-wing Russian antisemitic group [[Pamyat]].<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 8\" /> In a 1993 speech, Irving claimed that there had been only 100,000 Jewish deaths at Auschwitz, \"but not from gas chambers. They died from epidemics\".<ref name=\"Pelt 56\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=56}}.</ref> Irving went on to claim that most of the Jewish deaths during World War II had been caused by Allied bombing.<ref name=\"Pelt 56\" /> Irving claimed that \"The concentration camp inmates arrived in Berlin or [[Leipzig]] or in [[Dresden]] just in time for the [[RAF]] bombers to set fire to those cities. Nobody knows how many Jews died in those air raids\".<ref name=\"Pelt 56\" /> In a 1994 speech, Irving lamented that his predictions of 1991 had failed to occur, and complained of the persistence of belief in the \"rotting corpse\" of the \"profitable legend\" of the Holocaust.<ref name=\"Pelt 57\" /> In another 1994 speech, Irving claimed that there was no German policy of genocide of Jews, and that only 600,000 Jews died in concentration camps in World War II, all due to either Allied bombing or disease.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\" /> At the same time, Irving started to appear more frequently at the annual conferences hosted by the IHR.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 49-50\">{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|pp=49\u201350}}.</ref> In a 1995 speech, Irving claimed that the Holocaust was a myth invented by a \"world-wide Jewish cabal\" to serve their own ends.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=51}}.</ref> Irving also spoke on other topics at the IHR gatherings. A frequent theme was the claim that [[Winston Churchill]] had advance knowledge of the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] plans to attack [[Pearl Harbor]], and refused to warn the Americans, in order to bring the United States into World War II.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=56}}.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Irving maintained an ambivalent attitude to Holocaust denial depending on his audience. In a 1993 letter, Irving lashed out against his former friend Z\u00fcndel, writing that: \"In April 1988 I unhesitatingly agreed to aid your defence as a witness in Toronto. ''I would not make the same mistake again''. As a penalty for having defended you then, and for having continued to aid you since, my life has come under a gradually mounting attack: I find myself the worldwide victim of mass demonstrations, violence, vituperation and persecution\" (emphasis in the original). Irving went on to claim his life had been wonderful until Z\u00fcndel had got him involved in the Holocaust denial movement: van Pelt argues that Irving was just trying to shift responsibility for his actions in his letter.<ref name=\"Pelt 56\"/> In an interview with Australian radio in July 1995, Irving claimed that at least four million Jews died in World War II, though he argued that this was due to terrible sanitary conditions inside the concentration camps as opposed to a deliberate policy of genocide in the death camps.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\" /> Irving's statement led to a very public spat with his former ally Faurisson, who insisted that no Jews were killed in the Holocaust.<ref name=\"Pelt 56\" /> In 1995, Irving stated in another speech that \"I have to take off my hat to my adversaries and the strategies they have employed\u2014the marketing of the very word Holocaust: I half expected to see a little [[Trademark symbol|TM]] after it\".<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\" /> Likewise, depending on his audience, during the 1990s Irving either used the absence of a written ''F\u00fchrerbefehl'' (F\u00fchrer order) for the \"Final Solution\" to argue that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, or claimed that the absence of a written order meant there was no Holocaust at all.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 49-50\" />\n\n==Racism and antisemitism==\nIrving has expressed [[racism|racist]] and antisemitic sentiments, both publicly and privately. Irving has often expressed his belief in the theory of a sinister Jewish conspiracy ruling the world, and that the belief in the reality of Holocaust was manufactured as part of the same alleged conspiracy.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 51\" /> Irving used the label \"traditional enemies of the truth\" to describe Jews, and in a 1963 article about a speech by Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] wrote that the \"Yellow Star did not make a showing\".<ref name=\"Guttenplan 51\" /> In 1992, Irving stated that \"the Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time\" and claimed he \"foresees a new wave of antisemitism\" the world over due to Jewish \"exploitation of the Holocaust myth\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 180\" /> During an interview with the American writer [[Ron Rosenbaum]], Irving restated his belief that Jews were his \"traditional enemy\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=234}}.</ref> In one interview cited in the libel lawsuit, Irving also stated that he would be \"willing to put [his] signature\" to the \"fact\" that \"a great deal of control over the world is exercised by Jews\".<ref name=\"vs\">Interview for ''This Week'', 28 November 1991. pp. 7\u20138.

The National Press Club defended its invitation of Irving, saying that it amounted not to an endorsement of his views, but rather an opportunity to question him.

Several of Norway's most distinguished authors protested against the invitation. The leader of the board for the festival, Jesper Holte, defended the invitation by stating that \"Our agenda is to invite a liar and a falsifier of history to a festival about truth. And confront him with this. Irving has been invited to discuss his concept of [[truth]] in light of his activity as a writer of historical books and the many accusations he has been exposed to as a consequence of this.\" Although Irving was introduced in the festival's webpages as \"historian and writer\", the board chair leader defended the more aggressive language being used to characterize Irving in connection with the controversy that had arisen. [[Lars Saabye Christensen]] and [[Roy Jacobsen]] were two authors who had threatened to boycott the festival on account of Irving's invitation and [[Anne B. Ragde]] stated that [[Sigrid Undset]] would have turned around in her grave.

His interpretations of the war were widely regarded as unduly favourable to the German side.

A marked change in Irving's reputation can be seen in the surveys of the [[historiography of the Third Reich]] produced by [[Ian Kershaw]].

He then moved to Spain, where he worked as a clerk at an air base.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> \n\nIn 1962, he wrote a series of 37 articles on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing campaign]], ''Und Deutschlands St\u00e4dte starben nicht'' (''And Germany's Cities Did Not Die''), for the German [[boulevard journalism|boulevard journal]] ''Neue Illustrierte''. These were the basis for his first book, ''[[The Destruction of Dresden]]'' (1963), in which he examined the Allied [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945. By the 1960s, a debate about the morality of the [[carpet bombing]] of German cities and civilian population had already begun, especially in the United Kingdom. There was consequently considerable interest in Irving's book, which was illustrated with graphic pictures, and it became an international [[best-seller]].\n\nIn the first edition, Irving's estimates for deaths in [[Dresden]] were between 100,000 and 250,000 \u2013 notably higher than most previously published figures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=225\u2013226}}.</ref> These figures became authoritative and widely accepted in many standard reference works. In later editions of the book over the next three decades, he gradually adjusted the figure downwards to 50,000\u2013100,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=43}}.</ref> According to [[Richard J. Evans]] at the 2000 libel trial that Irving brought against [[Deborah Lipstadt]], Irving based his estimates of the dead of Dresden on the word of one individual who provided no supporting documentation, used forged documents, and described one witness who was a [[urologist]] as Dresden's Deputy Chief Medical Officer. The doctor later complained about being misidentified by Irving, and further, that he, the doctor, was only repeating rumours about the death toll.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=225}}.</ref>\n\nThe number of deaths in the bombing raids may never be known. The presence in the city of over 100,000 refugees fleeing the advance of the Red Army means there is no accurate record of them. Two tourist books, one written by Herbert Wotte and Siegfried Hoyer, published in 1978, give the casualties as 35,000; another compiled by Jurgen Rach and Erwin and Inge Hartsche (1977), agrees with this figure. The [[East Germany|DDR]] officially accepted figure was \"a minimum of 35,000 dead\". Alexander McKee looked at other firebombings of German cities, notably Hamburg, and concluded that \"the figure of 35,000 for one night's massacre alone might easily be doubled to 70,000 without much fear of exaggeration, because of the exodus of refugees from Silesia.\"<ref>McKee, Alexander, ''Dresden 1945'', Granada Publishing Ltd., UK, 1983, pps:369\u2013370. {{ISBN|0-583-13686-9}}</ref> However, according to an investigation by Dresden City Council in 2008, casualties at Dresden were estimated as 22,700\u201325,000 dead.<ref>Seeking to establish a definitive casualty figure, an independent investigation (commissioned by the Dresden city council), ended in 2010 drawing a conclusion that a maximum of 25,000 people were killed, of which 22,700 deaths have been positively identified\u201420,100 named and a further 2,600 unnamed ({{Citation|date=10 January 2008 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26977893 |title=Report: Dresden bombing deaths overestimated |publisher=NBC News}};  {{in lang|de}} {{Citation  |date=15 April 2010  |url=http://www.sz-online.de/Nachrichten/Freital/?etag=15.04.2010 |title=Mindestzahl der Dresdner Bombenopfer nach oben korrigiert (lowest number of Dresden raids casualties corrected upwards|newspaper=[[S\u00e4chsische Zeitung]]}} {{subscription}}).</ref>\n\nIrving had based his numbers on what purported to be \"TB 47\", a document promulgated by Nazi Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], and on claims made after the war by a former Dresden Nazi functionary, Hans Voigt, without verifying them against official sources available in Dresden. Irving's estimates and sources were first disputed by [[Walter Weidauer]], Mayor of Dresden 1946\u20131958, in his own account of the Dresden bombing. When it was later confirmed that the TB 47 used was a forgery, Irving published a letter to the editor in ''[[The Times]]'' on 7 July 1966 retracting his estimates, writing that he had \"no interest in promoting or perpetuating false legends\". In 1977, the real document TB 47 was located in Dresden by G\u00f6tz Bergander.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|2001|pages=148\u2013184}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Walter|last= Weidauer|title=Inferno Dresden. \u00dcber L\u00fcgen und Legenden um die Aktion \"Donnerschlag.\"|publisher= Dietz Verlag|year=1965|isbn= 3-320-00818-8|pages=6,132}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=A German Catastrophe?: German Historians and the Allied Bombings, 1945\u20132010|series=UvA Proefschriften Seris|first=Bas |last=Von Benda-Beckmann|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year= 2010|isbn=978-9056296537|page=150}}</ref>\n\nDespite acknowledging that the copy of \"TB 47\" he had used was inaccurate, Irving argued during the late 1980s and 1990s that the death toll at Dresden was much higher than the accepted estimates: in several speeches during this period he said that 100,000 or more people had been killed in the bombing of Dresden.

In the latter book, Irving claimed that the plane crash which killed  [[Polish government in exile]] leader General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] in 1943 was really an assassination ordered by [[Winston Churchill]], so as to enable Churchill to betray Poland to the [[Soviet Union]]. Irving's book inspired the highly controversial 1967 play  ''[[Soldiers (play)|Soldiers]]'' by his friend, the German playwright [[Rolf Hochhuth]], where Hochhuth depicts Churchill ordering the assassination of General Sikorski.\n\nAlso in 1967, Irving published two more works: ''The Virus House'', an account of the [[German nuclear energy project]] for which Irving conducted many interviews,<ref name=\"Virus House research\"/> and ''The Destruction of Convoy PQ-17,'' in which he blamed the British escort group commander, Commander [[Jack Broome]] for the catastrophic losses of the [[Convoy PQ 17]]. Amid much publicity, Broome sued Irving for libel in October 1968, and in February 1970, after a 17 day-trial before London's [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], Broome won. Irving was forced to pay \u00a340,000 in damages, and the book was withdrawn from circulation.\n\nAfter ''PQ-17'', Irving largely shifted to writing biographies. In 1968, he published ''Breach of Security'', an account of German reading of messages to and from the British Embassy in Berlin before 1939 with an introduction by the British historian [[Donald Cameron Watt]]. As a result of Irving's success with ''Dresden'', members of Germany's extreme right wing assisted him in contacting surviving members of Hitler's inner circle. In an interview with the American journalist [[Ron Rosenbaum]], Irving claimed to have developed sympathies towards them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|pp=227\u2013229}}.</ref> Many ageing former mid- and high-ranked Nazis saw a potential friend in Irving and donated diaries and other material. Irving described his historical work to Rosenbaum as an act of \"stone-cleaning\" of Hitler, in which he cleared off the \"slime\" that he felt had been unjustly applied to Hitler's reputation.<ref name=\"Rosenbaum 232\" />\n\nIn 1969, during a visit to Germany, Irving met [[Robert Kempner]], one of the American prosecutors at the [[Nuremberg trials]].<ref name=\"Lipstadt 293\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=293}}.</ref> Irving asked Kempner if the \"official record of the Nuremberg Trials was falsified\", and told him that he was planning to go to Washington, D.C., to compare the sound recordings of Luftwaffe Field-Marshal [[Erhard Milch]]'s March 1946 evidence with the subsequently published texts to find proof that evidence given at Nuremberg was \"tampered with and manipulated\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|pp=293\u2013294}}.</ref> Upon his return to the United States, Kempner wrote to [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], that Irving expressed many \"anti-American and anti-Jewish statements\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 293\" />\n\nIn 1971, Irving translated the memoirs of General [[Reinhard Gehlen]], and in 1973 published ''The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe'', a biography of Field Marshal Milch. He spent the remainder of the 1970s working on ''[[Hitler's War]]'' and ''The War Path'', his two-part biography of Adolf Hitler; ''The Trail of the Fox,'' a biography of Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]; and a series in the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' describing the [[Royal Air Force]]'s famous [[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]] raid. In 1975, in his introduction to ''Hitler und seine Feldherren'', the German edition of ''Hitler's War'', Irving attacked [[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank's diary]] as a forgery, claiming falsely that a New York court had ruled that the diary was really the work of American scriptwriter [[Meyer Levin]] \"in collaboration with the girl's father\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=232}}.</ref>\n\n==Revisionism==\n\n===''Hitler's War''===\n{{main|Hitler's War}}\n\nIn 1977 Irving published ''[[Hitler's War]]'', the first of his two-part biography of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Irving's intention in ''Hitler's War'' was to clean away the \"years of grime and discoloration from the facade of a silent and forbidding monument\" to reveal the real Hitler, whose reputation Irving argued had been slandered by historians.<ref name=\"Craig 72\">{{Harvnb|Craig|1982|p=72}}.</ref> In ''Hitler's War'', Irving tried to \"view the situation as far as possible through Hitler's eyes, from behind his desk\".<ref name=\"Craig 72\" /> He portrayed Hitler as a rational, intelligent politician, whose only goal was to increase Germany's prosperity and influence on the continent, and who was constantly let down by incompetent or treasonous subordinates.<ref name=\"Craig 72\" /> Irving's book faulted the Allied leaders, especially [[Winston Churchill]], for the eventual escalation of war, and argued that the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941 was a \"[[preventive war]]\" forced on Hitler to avert an impending Soviet attack.<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\">{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=166 n. 20}}.</ref> He also argued that Hitler had no knowledge of [[the Holocaust]]: while not denying its occurrence, Irving argued that [[Heinrich Himmler]] and his deputy [[Reinhard Heydrich]] were its originators and architects. Irving made much of the lack of any written order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust, and for decades afterward offered to pay \u00a31,000 to anyone who could find such an order.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 46\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nCritical reaction to ''Hitler's War'' was generally negative. Reviewers took issue with Irving's factual claims as well as his conclusions. For example, American historian Charles Sydnor noted numerous errors in ''Hitler's War'', such as Irving's unreferenced statement that the Jews who fought in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943 were well supplied with weapons from Germany's allies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979| p=179}}</ref> Sydnor pointed out that Hitler had received an SS report in November 1942 which contained a mention of 363,211 Russian Jews executed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' between August and November 1942.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979| pp=182\u2013183}}</ref> Sydnor remarked that Irving's statement that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in charge in the [[Extermination camp|death camps]] seems to indicate that he was not familiar with the history of the Holocaust, as the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in fact mobile death squads who had nothing to do with the death camps.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979 |p=176}}</ref>\n\n===Irving's work of the late 1970s and early 1980s===\nJust months after the initial release of ''Hitler's War'', Irving published ''The Trail of the Fox'', a biography of [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]]. In it, Irving attacked the members of the [[20 July Plot]] to assassinate Hitler, branding them \"traitors\", \"cowards\", and \"manipulators\", and uncritically presented Hitler and his government's subsequent revenge against the plotters, of which Rommel was also a victim. In particular, Irving accused Rommel's friend and Chief of Staff General [[Hans Speidel]] of framing Rommel in the attempted coup. The British historian [[David Pryce-Jones]] in a book review of ''The Trail of the Fox'' in the edition of 12 November 1977 of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' accused Irving of taking everything Hitler had to say at face value.<ref name=\"adl profile\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Irving released ''The War Path'', the companion volume to ''Hitler's War'' which covered events leading up to the war and which was written from a similar point of view. Again, professional historians such as Donald Cameron Watt noted numerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Despite the criticism, the book sold well, as did all of Irving's books to that date. The financial success of his books enabled Irving to buy a home in the prestigious [[Mayfair]] district of London, own a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] car, and to enjoy a very affluent lifestyle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=52}}.</ref> In addition, Irving, despite being married, became increasingly open about his affairs with other women, all of which were detailed in his self-published diary.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 51\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=51}}.</ref> Irving's affairs were to cause his first marriage to end in divorce in 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, Irving started researching and writing about topics other than Nazi Germany, but with less success. He began his research on his three-part biography of [[Winston Churchill]]. After publication Irving's work on Churchill received at least one bad review from Professor [[David Cannadine]] (then of the [[University of London]]):\n\n{{quote|It has received almost no attention from historians or reviewers ... It is easy to see why ... full of excesses, inconsistencies and omissions ... seems completely unaware of recent work done on the subject ... It is not merely that the arguments in this book are so perversely tendentious and irresponsibly sensationalist. It is also that it is written in a tone which is at best casually journalistic and at worst quite exceptionally offensive. The text is littered with errors from beginning to end.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/i/irving-david/ |title=David Irving: Britain's Holocaust \"revisionist\" |publisher=Nizkor.org |accessdate=2 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812023313/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/i/irving-david/ |archive-date=12 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1981, he published two books. The first was ''The War Between the Generals'', in which Irving offered an account of the Allied High Command on the Western Front in 1944\u201345, detailing the heated conflicts Irving alleges occurred between the various generals of the various countries and presenting rumours about their private lives. The second book was ''Uprising!'', about the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|1956 revolt in Hungary]], which Irving characterised as \"primarily an anti-Jewish uprising\", supposedly because the Communist regime was itself controlled by Jews. Irving's depiction of Hungary's Communist regime as a Jewish dictatorship oppressing [[Gentiles]] sparked charges of [[antisemitism]].<ref name=\"Guttenplan 47\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=47}}.</ref> In addition, there were complaints that Irving had grossly exaggerated the number of people of Jewish origin in the Communist regime and had ignored the fact that [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] Communists who did have a Jewish background like [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]] had totally repudiated Judaism and sometimes expressed antisemitic attitudes themselves.<ref name=\"observer 1981\"/> Critics such as [[Neal Ascherson]] and [[Kai Bird]] took issue with some of Irving's language that seemed to evoke antisemitic imagery, such as his remark that R\u00e1kosi possessed \"the tact of a [[kosher]] butcher\".<ref name=\"Guttenplan 47\" />\n\n===Hitler Diaries===\nIn 1983, ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', a weekly German news magazine, purchased 61 volumes of [[Hitler Diaries|Hitler's supposed diaries]] for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 9 million and published excerpts from them. Irving played the main role in exposing the Hitler Diaries as a hoax. In October 1982 Irving had purchased, from the same source as ''Stern'''s 1983 purchase, 800 pages of documents relating to Hitler, only to conclude that many of the documents were forgeries.<ref name=\"Evans 2001 19\">{{Harvnb|Evans|2001|p=19}}.</ref> Irving was amongst the first to identify the diaries as forgeries, and to draw media attention. He went so far as to crash the press conference held by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] at the [[Hamburg]] offices of ''Stern'' magazine on 25 April 1983 to denounce the diaries as a forgery and Trevor-Roper for endorsing the diaries as genuine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=48}}.</ref> Irving's performance at the ''Stern'' press conference where he violently harangued Trevor-Roper until ejected by security led him to be featured prominently on the news: the next day, Irving appeared on the ''Today'' television show as a featured guest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1986|pp=320\u2013323}}.</ref> Irving had concluded that the alleged Hitler diaries were a forgery because they had come from the same dealer in Nazi memorabilia from whom Irving had purchased his collection in 1982.<ref name=\"Evans 2001 19\" /> At the press conference in Hamburg, Irving said, \"I know the collection from which these diaries come. It is an old collection, full of forgeries. I have some here\".<ref name=\"Evans 2001 19\" /> Irving was proud to have detected and denounced the hoax material and of the \"trail of chaos\" he had created at the Hamburg press conference and the attendant publicity it had brought him, and took pride in his humiliation of Trevor-Roper, whom Irving strongly disliked for his sloppy work, in not detecting the hoax, and past criticism of Irving's methods and conclusions.<ref name=\"Pelt 22\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=22}}.</ref> Irving also noted internal inconsistencies in the supposed Hitler diaries, such as a diary entry for [[July 20 plot|July 20, 1944]], which would have been unlikely given that Hitler's right hand had been badly burned by the bomb planted in his headquarters by Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=19}}.</ref>\n\nA week later on 2 May, Irving asserted that many of the diary documents appear to be genuine: at the same press conference, Irving took the opportunity to promote his translation of the memoirs of Hitler's physician Dr. [[Theodor Morell]].<ref name=\"Pelt 22\" /> [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], in his book ''Selling Hitler'', suggested that an additional reason for Irving's change of mind over the authenticity of the alleged Hitler diaries was that the fake diaries contain no reference to the Holocaust, thereby buttressing Irving's claim in ''Hitler's War'' that Hitler had no knowledge of it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|1986|pp=338\u2013339}}.</ref> Subsequently, Irving conformed when the diaries were declared a forgery by consensus. At a press conference held to withdraw his endorsement of the diaries, Irving proudly claimed that he was the first to call them a forgery, to which a reporter replied that he was also the last to call them genuine.<ref name=\"Pelt 22\" />\n\n===Other books===\nBy the mid-1980s, Irving had not had a successful book for some years, and was behind schedule in writing the first volume of his Churchill series, the research for which had strained his finances.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 56\">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=56}}.</ref> He finished the manuscript in 1985, but the book was not published until 1987, when it was released as ''Churchill's War, Volume I''.\n\nIn 1989, Irving published his biography of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].\n\n==Holocaust denial==\n\n===Movement towards Holocaust denial===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99621, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''Reichsf\u00fchrer''-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]]. A note in Himmler's telephone log from 30 November 1941 saying \"no liquidation\" was later used by Irving as the central argument trying to prove that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust.]]\nOver the years, Irving's stance on the Holocaust changed significantly. From 1988, he started to espouse [[Holocaust denial]] openly: he had previously not denied the Holocaust outright and for this reason, many Holocaust deniers were ambivalent about him.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=21}}.</ref> They admired Irving for the pro-Nazi slant in his work and the fact that he possessed a degree of mainstream credibility that they lacked, but were annoyed that he did not openly deny the Holocaust. In 1980, [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] noted that, although ''Hitler's War'' was strongly sympathetic to the Third Reich, because Irving argued that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust as opposed to denying the Holocaust happened at all, his book was not part of the \"anti-Semitic canon\".<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy \"Lies About the Holocaust\" pages 31\u201337 from ''Commentary'', Volume 70, Issue # 6, p. 35</ref> In 1980, Irving received an invitation to speak at a Holocaust-denial conference, which he refused on the grounds that his appearance there would damage his reputation.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> In a letter, Irving stated his reasons for his refusal as: \"This is pure ''[[Realpolitik]]'' on my part. I am already dangerously exposed, and I cannot take the chance of being caught in flak meant for others!\"<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> Though Irving refused at this time to appear at conferences sponsored by the Holocaust-denying [[Institute for Historical Review]] (IHR), he did grant the institute the right to distribute his books in the United States.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] suggests that the major reason for Irving wishing to keep his distance from Holocaust deniers in the early 1980s was his desire to found his own political party called Focus.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" />\n\nIn a footnote in the first edition of ''Hitler's War'', Irving writes, \"I cannot accept the view...  [that] there exists no document signed by Hitler, Himmler or [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]] speaking of the extermination of the Jews\". In 1982, Irving temporarily stopped writing and made an attempt to unify all of the various far-right splinter groups in Britain into one party called Focus, in which he would play a leading role.<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> Irving described himself as a \"moderate fascist\" and spoke of plans to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]],<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=161}}.</ref> but his efforts to move into politics, which Irving regarded at the time as very important, failed due to fiscal problems.<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> Irving told the ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' of having \"links at a low level\" with the [[National Front (UK)|British National Front]].<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> Irving described ''[[The Spotlight]]'', the main journal of the [[Liberty Lobby]], as \"an excellent fortnightly paper\".<ref name=\"Evans 1989 166\" /> At the same time, Irving put a copy of Hitler's \"Prophecy Speech\" of 30 January 1939, promising the \"annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\" if \"Jewish financiers\" started another world war, onto his wall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=167}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing the failure of Focus, in September 1983, Irving for the first time attended a conference of the IHR.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> Van Pelt has argued that, with the failure of Irving's political career, he felt freer to associate with Holocaust deniers.<ref name=\"Pelt 21\" /> At the conference, Irving did not deny the Holocaust, but did appear happy to share the stage with [[Robert Faurisson]] and Judge [[Wilhelm St\u00e4glich]], and claimed to be impressed with the allegations of Friedrich Berg that [[mass murder]] using [[Diesel fuel|diesel gas fumes]] at the [[Operation Reinhard]] death camps was impossible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|pp=22\u201323}}.</ref> At that conference, Irving repeated his claims that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust because he was \"so busy being a soldier\".<ref name=\"Pelt 23\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=23}}.</ref> In a speech at that conference, Irving stated: \"Isn't it right for Tel Aviv to claim now that David Irving is talking nonsense and ''of course'' Adolf Hitler must have known about what was going in Auschwitz and Treblinka, and then in the same breath to claim that, ''of course'' our beloved [[Menachem Begin|Mr. Begin]] didn't know what was going on in [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Chatilla]]\".<ref name=\"Pelt 23\" /> During the same speech, Irving proclaimed Hitler to be the \"biggest friend the Jews had in the Third Reich\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 162\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=162}}.</ref> In the same speech, Irving stated that he operated in such a way as to bring himself maximum publicity. Irving stated that: \"I have at home... a filing cabinet full of documents which I don't issue all at once. I keep them: I issue them a bit at a time. When I think my name hasn't been in the newspapers for several weeks, well, then I ring them up and I phone them and I say: 'What about this one, then?'\"<ref name=\"Pelt 23\" />\n\nA major theme of Irving's writings from the 1980s was his belief that it had been a great blunder on the part of Britain to declare war on Germany in 1939, and that ever since then and as a result of that decision, Britain had slipped into an unstoppable decline.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> Irving also took the view that Hitler often tried to help the Jews of Europe.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> In a June 1992 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Irving claimed to have heard from Hitler's naval adjutant that the ''F\u00fchrer'' had told him that he could not marry because Germany was \"his bride\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> Irving then claimed to have asked the naval adjutant when Hitler made that remark, and upon hearing that the date was 24 March 1938, Irving stated in response \"Herr Admiral, at that moment I was being born\". Irving used this alleged incident to argue that there was some sort of mystical connection between himself and Hitler.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161-162\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|pp=161\u2013162}}.</ref>\n\nIn a 1986 speech in Australia Irving argued that photographs of Holocaust survivors and dead taken in early 1945 by Allied soldiers were proof that the Allies were responsible for the Holocaust, not the Germans.<ref name=\"Pelt 40\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=40}}.</ref> Irving claimed that the Holocaust was not the work of Nazi leaders, but rather of \"nameless criminals\",<ref name=\"Pelt 40\" /> and claimed that \"these men [who killed the Jews] acted on their own impulse, their own initiative, within the general atmosphere of brutality created by the Second World War, in which of course Allied bombings played a part.\"<ref name=\"Pelt 40\" /> In another 1986 speech, this time in [[Atlanta]], Irving claimed that \"historians have a blindness when it comes to the Holocaust because like [[Tay\u2013Sachs disease]] it is a Jewish disease which causes blindness\".<ref name=s32>{{Harvnb|Stern |1992 |p=32}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Irving associated himself with the IHR, began giving lectures to groups such as the far-right German [[Deutsche Volksunion]] (DVU), and publicly denied that the Nazis systematically exterminated Jews in gas chambers during World War II.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 8\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=8}}.</ref> Irving was present at a memorial service for [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] in January 1983 after the latter's death, organised by the DVU and Frey, delivering a speech,<ref>{{cite news |date=9 January 1983|title=Big crowd commemorates death of Nazi pilot|trans-title=|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/09/Big-crowd-commemorates-death-of-Nazi-pilot/7256410936400/|language=|work=[[United Press International]]|location= |access-date=27 November 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gedenkveranstaltung f\u00fcr Hans Ulrich Rudel, 1983|trans-title=Memorial service for Hans Ulrich Rudel, 1983|url=https://www.sz-photo.de/?16607724099100603390&EVENT=POPUP&WINDOW=WGWINe4704873e01b6fac8cb1c19fdf7143a9&AJXUID=0.7987179042092476&MEDIANUMBER=00325558&MEDIAITEMS=667e82876af943c49f10de114a6d270cc7811f83&OMG=fde34952c756&PAGING_SCOPE_4=29&MEDIAGROUP_SCOPE=1|language=German|work=[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]|location= |access-date=28 November 2018 }}</ref> and was given the Hans-Ulrich-Rudel-Award by Frey in June 1985.<ref>{{cite web |title=Funke: David Irving, Holocaust denial, and his connections to right wing extremists and neo-national socialism (neo-nazism) in Germany|trans-title=|url=https://www.hdot.org/funke/|language=|work=[[Emory University]]|location= |access-date=27 November 2018 }}</ref> Irving was a frequent speaker for the DVU in the 1980s and the early 1990s, but the relationship ended in 1993 apparently because of concerns by the DVU that Irving's espousal of Holocaust denial might lead to the DVU being banned.<ref name=\"adl profile\"/>\n\nIn 1986, Irving visited Toronto, where he was met at the airport by Holocaust denier [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]].<ref name=\"Pelt 41\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=41}}.</ref> According to Z\u00fcndel, Irving \"thought I was 'Revisionist-Neo-Nazi-Rambo-Kook!'\", and asked Z\u00fcndel to stay away from him.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\" /> Z\u00fcndel and his supporters obliged Irving by staying away from his lecture tour, which consequently attracted little media attention, and was considered by Irving to be a failure.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\" /> Afterwards, Z\u00fcndel sent Irving a long letter in which he offered to draw publicity to Irving, and so ensure that his future speaking tours would be a success.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\"/> As a result, Irving and Z\u00fcndel became friends, and Irving agreed in late 1987 to testify for Z\u00fcndel at his second trial for denying the Holocaust.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=42}}.</ref> In addition, the publication in 1987 of the book ''Der europ\u00e4ische B\u00fcrgerkrieg 1917\u20131945'' by [[Ernst Nolte]], in which Nolte strongly implied that maybe Holocaust deniers were on to something, encouraged Irving to become more open in associating with Z\u00fcndel.<ref name=\"Pelt 41\" />\n\n===Z\u00fcndel trial===\nIn January 1988, Irving travelled to Toronto, Ontario, to assist [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Douglas Christie]], the defence lawyer for [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] at his [[R. v. Zundel|second trial]] for denying the Holocaust.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> Working closely with [[Robert Faurisson]], who was also assisting the defence, Irving contacted Warden Bill Armontrout of the Missouri State Penitentiary who recommended that Irving and Faurisson get into touch with [[Fred A. Leuchter]], a self-described execution expert living in Boston.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 162\" /> Irving and Faurisson then flew to Boston to meet with Leuchter, who agreed to lend his alleged technical expertise on the behalf of Z\u00fcndel's defence.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> Irving argued that an alleged expert on gassings like Leuchter could prove that the Holocaust was a \"myth\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 161\" /> After work on the second Z\u00fcndel trial, Irving declared that based on his exposure to Z\u00fcndel's and Leuchter's theories that he was now conducting a \"one-man ''[[wikt:intifada|intifada]]''\" against the idea that there had been a Holocaust.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=179}}.</ref> Subsequently, Irving claimed to the American journalist [[DD Guttenplan|D.D.

He also expressed his evolving belief that the Final Solution involved \"[[war crimes|atrocities]]\", not systematic murder: \"I don't think there was any overall ''Reich'' policy to kill the Jews. If there was, they would have been killed and there would not be now so many millions of survivors.

Leuchter, which claimed there was no evidence for the existence of homicidal [[gas chamber]]s at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Irving said in a 1999 documentary about Leuchter: \"The big point [of the Leuchter report]: there is no significant residue of [[cyanide]] in the brickwork. That's what converted me. When I read that in the report in the courtroom in Toronto, I became a hard-core disbeliever\".<ref>''Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.''.</ref> In addition, Irving was influenced to embrace Holocaust denial by the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]]'s 1988 book ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'', which did not deny the Holocaust, but claimed that most of those who died at Auschwitz were killed by disease: Irving saw in Mayer's book an apparent confirmation of Leuchter's and Z\u00fcndel's theories about no mass murder at Auschwitz.<ref>{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|pp=47\u201348}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the trial, Irving published Leuchter's report as ''Auschwitz The End of the Line: The Leuchter Report'' in the United Kingdom in 1989 and wrote its foreword.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> Leuchter's book had been first published in Canada by Z\u00fcndel's [[Samisdat Publishers]] in 1988 as ''The Leuchter Report: The End of a Myth: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=260}}.</ref> In his foreword to the British edition of Leuchter's book, Irving wrote that \"Nobody likes to be swindled, still less where considerable sums of money are involved\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> The alleged swindle was the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations]] money totalling 3 billion DM paid by the Federal Republic of Germany to Israel between 1952\u20131966 for the Holocaust. Irving described the reparations as being \"essentially in atonement for the 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz\", which Irving called a \"myth\" that would \"not die easily\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> In his foreword, Irving praised the \"scrupulous methods\" and \"integrity\" of Leuchter.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" />\n\nFor publishing and writing the foreword to ''Auschwitz The End of the Line'', on 20 June 1989 Irving together with Leuchter was condemned in an [[Early Day Motion]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as \"Hitler's heirs\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|pp=179\u2013180}}.</ref> The motion went on to describe Irving as a \"Nazi propagandist and longtime Hitler apologist\" and ''Auschwitz The End of the Line'' as a \"fascist publication\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 180\" /> In the Motion, the House stated that they were \"appalled by [the Holocaust denial of] Nazi propagandist and long-time Hitler apologist David Irving\".<ref name=s32/> In response to the House of Commons motion, Irving in a press statement challenged the MPs who voted to condemn him, writing that: \"I will enter the 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz and you and your friends may lob in [[Zyklon B]] in accordance with the well known procedures and conditions.

The court fined Irving DM 7,000. Irving appealed against the judgement, and received a fine of DM 10,000 for repeating the same remarks in the courtroom on 5 May 1992.<ref name=\"Pelt 55\" /> During his appeal in 1992, Irving called upon those present in the Munich courtroom to \"fight a battle for the German people and put an end to the blood lie of the Holocaust which has been told against this country for fifty years\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> Irving went on to call the Auschwitz death camp a \"tourist attraction\" whose origins Irving claimed went back to an \"ingenious plan\" devised by the British Psychological Warfare Executive in 1942 to spread anti-German propaganda that it was the policy of the German state to be \"using 'gas chambers' to kill millions of Jews and other undesirables\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 179\" /> During the same speech, Irving denounced the judge as a \"[[senile]], alcoholic cretin\".<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\">{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=50}}.</ref> Following his conviction for Holocaust denial, Irving was banned from visiting Germany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=221}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Auschwitz Birkenau German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940-1945)-107820.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Inside a barracks in [[Auschwitz II Birkenau]].

In a speech given in [[Hamburg]] in 1991, Irving stated that in two years' time \"this myth of mass murders of Jews in the death factories of Auschwitz, [[Majdanek]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] ... which in fact never took place\" will be disproved (Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka were all well established as being [[extermination camp]]s).<ref name=\"Rosenbaum 222\">{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=222}}.</ref> Two days later, Irving repeated the same speech in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] before a group of neo-Nazis, and praised [[Rudolf Hess]] as \"that great German martyr, Rudolf Hess\".<ref name=\"Rosenbaum 222\" /> At another 1991 speech, this time in Canada, Irving called the Holocaust a \"hoax\", and again predicted that by 1993 the \"hoax\" would have been \"exposed\".<ref name=\"Pelt 57\" /> In that speech, Irving declared, \"Gradually the word is getting around Germany. Two years from now too, the German historians will accept that we are right. They will accept that for fifty years they have believed a lie\".<ref name=\"Pelt 57\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=57}}.</ref> During that speech given in October 1991, Irving expressed his contempt and hatred for Holocaust survivors by proclaiming that:\n\n<blockquote>Ridicule alone isn't enough, you've got to be tasteless about it. You've got to say things like 'More women died on the back seat of [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]]'s car at [[Chappaquiddick incident|Chappaquiddick]] than in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.' Now you think that's tasteless, what about this? I'm forming an association especially dedicated to all these liars, the ones who try and kid people that they were in these concentration camps, it's called the Auschwitz Survivors, Survivors of the Holocaust and Other Liars, 'ASSHOLs'. Can't get more tasteless than that, but you've got to be tasteless because these people deserve our contempt.</blockquote>\n\nIn another 1991 speech, this time in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], Irving called the Holocaust \"a major fraud... There were no gas chambers. They were fakes and frauds\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Stern|1992|p=48}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1992, Irving was to be a featured speaker at a world [[anti zionism|anti-Zionist]] congress in [[Stockholm]] that was cancelled by the Swedish government.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 8\" /> Also scheduled to attend were fellow Holocaust-deniers [[Robert Faurisson]] and [[Fred A.

They died from epidemics\".<ref name=\"Pelt 56\">{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=56}}.</ref> Irving went on to claim that most of the Jewish deaths during World War II had been caused by Allied bombing.<ref name=\"Pelt 56\" /> Irving claimed that \"The concentration camp inmates arrived in Berlin or [[Leipzig]] or in [[Dresden]] just in time for the [[RAF]] bombers to set fire to those cities. Nobody knows how many Jews died in those air raids\".<ref name=\"Pelt 56\" /> In a 1994 speech, Irving lamented that his predictions of 1991 had failed to occur, and complained of the persistence of belief in the \"rotting corpse\" of the \"profitable legend\" of the Holocaust.<ref name=\"Pelt 57\" /> In another 1994 speech, Irving claimed that there was no German policy of genocide of Jews, and that only 600,000 Jews died in concentration camps in World War II, all due to either Allied bombing or disease.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\" /> At the same time, Irving started to appear more frequently at the annual conferences hosted by the IHR.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 49-50\">{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|pp=49\u201350}}.</ref> In a 1995 speech, Irving claimed that the Holocaust was a myth invented by a \"world-wide Jewish cabal\" to serve their own ends.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=51}}.</ref> Irving also spoke on other topics at the IHR gatherings. A frequent theme was the claim that [[Winston Churchill]] had advance knowledge of the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] plans to attack [[Pearl Harbor]], and refused to warn the Americans, in order to bring the United States into World War II.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=56}}.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Irving maintained an ambivalent attitude to Holocaust denial depending on his audience. In a 1993 letter, Irving lashed out against his former friend Z\u00fcndel, writing that: \"In April 1988 I unhesitatingly agreed to aid your defence as a witness in Toronto. ''I would not make the same mistake again''. As a penalty for having defended you then, and for having continued to aid you since, my life has come under a gradually mounting attack: I find myself the worldwide victim of mass demonstrations, violence, vituperation and persecution\" (emphasis in the original). Irving went on to claim his life had been wonderful until Z\u00fcndel had got him involved in the Holocaust denial movement: van Pelt argues that Irving was just trying to shift responsibility for his actions in his letter.<ref name=\"Pelt 56\"/> In an interview with Australian radio in July 1995, Irving claimed that at least four million Jews died in World War II, though he argued that this was due to terrible sanitary conditions inside the concentration camps as opposed to a deliberate policy of genocide in the death camps.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\" /> Irving's statement led to a very public spat with his former ally Faurisson, who insisted that no Jews were killed in the Holocaust.<ref name=\"Pelt 56\" /> In 1995, Irving stated in another speech that \"I have to take off my hat to my adversaries and the strategies they have employed\u2014the marketing of the very word Holocaust: I half expected to see a little [[Trademark symbol|TM]] after it\".<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 50\" /> Likewise, depending on his audience, during the 1990s Irving either used the absence of a written ''F\u00fchrerbefehl'' (F\u00fchrer order) for the \"Final Solution\" to argue that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, or claimed that the absence of a written order meant there was no Holocaust at all.<ref name=\"Shermer Grobman 49-50\" />\n\n==Racism and antisemitism==\nIrving has expressed [[racism|racist]] and antisemitic sentiments, both publicly and privately. Irving has often expressed his belief in the theory of a sinister Jewish conspiracy ruling the world, and that the belief in the reality of Holocaust was manufactured as part of the same alleged conspiracy.<ref name=\"Guttenplan 51\" /> Irving used the label \"traditional enemies of the truth\" to describe Jews, and in a 1963 article about a speech by Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] wrote that the \"Yellow Star did not make a showing\".<ref name=\"Guttenplan 51\" /> In 1992, Irving stated that \"the Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time\" and claimed he \"foresees a new wave of antisemitism\" the world over due to Jewish \"exploitation of the Holocaust myth\".<ref name=\"Lipstadt 1993 180\" /> During an interview with the American writer [[Ron Rosenbaum]], Irving restated his belief that Jews were his \"traditional enemy\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=234}}.</ref> In one interview cited in the libel lawsuit, Irving also stated that he would be \"willing to put [his] signature\" to the \"fact\" that \"a great deal of control over the world is exercised by Jews\".<ref name=\"vs\">Interview for ''This Week'', 28 November 1991. pp. 7\u20138.

Several of Norway's most distinguished authors protested against the invitation. The leader of the board for the festival, Jesper Holte, defended the invitation by stating that \"Our agenda is to invite a liar and a falsifier of history to a festival about truth. And confront him with this. Irving has been invited to discuss his concept of [[truth]] in light of his activity as a writer of historical books and the many accusations he has been exposed to as a consequence of this.\" Although Irving was introduced in the festival's webpages as \"historian and writer\", the board chair leader defended the more aggressive language being used to characterize Irving in connection with the controversy that had arisen. [[Lars Saabye Christensen]] and [[Roy Jacobsen]] were two authors who had threatened to boycott the festival on account of Irving's invitation and [[Anne B. Ragde]] stated that [[Sigrid Undset]] would have turned around in her grave. As the festival has as its subsidiary name \"Sigrid Undset Days\", a representative of Undset's family had requested that the name of the Nobel laureate be removed in connection with the festival.<ref>{{cite news|first=Geir |last=Rakvaag |title=Irving fortsatt invitert |url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article372935.ece |work=[[Dagsavisen]] |location=Oslo |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008174519/http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article372935.ece |archivedate=8 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Vibecke |last= Wold Haagensen |title= Irving invitert som l\u00f8gner |url= http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.6252043 |publisher= [[NRK]] |location= [[Hedmark]]/[[Oppland]] |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |language= Norwegian}}</ref> Also the Norwegian [[free speech]] organization [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]] was critical towards letting Irving speak at the festival<ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news |title= Holocaust denier unwelcome in Norway |url= http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/10/09/Holocaust_denier_unwelcome_in_Norway/UPI-56301223577740/ |agency = [[United Press International|UPI]] |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2008}}</ref> and had requested that its logo be removed from the festival.<ref>{{cite news|title=Holocaust denial speaker's invitation cancelled |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2704141.ece |work=[[Aftenposten]] |location=Oslo, Norway |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010220014/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2704141.ece |archivedate=10 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> In addition [[Edvard Hoem]] announced that he would not attend the 2009 festival with Irving taking part.

His interpretations of the war were widely regarded as unduly favourable to the German side. At first this was seen as personal opinion, unpopular but consistent with full respectability as a historian.<ref name=\"Lipstadt 2005 22\">{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=22}}.</ref>\n\nBy 1988, however, Irving had begun to reject the status of the Holocaust as a systematic and deliberate genocide. He soon became the main proponent of Holocaust denial. This, along with his association with far-right circles, dented his standing as a historian. A marked change in Irving's reputation can be seen in the surveys of the [[historiography of the Third Reich]] produced by [[Ian Kershaw]]. In the first edition of Kershaw's book ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' in 1985, Irving was called a \"maverick\" historian working outside the mainstream of the historical profession.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kershaw|1985|p=150}}.</ref> By the time of the fourth edition of ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' in 2000, Irving was described only as a historical writer who had in the 1970s engaged in \"provocations\" intended to provide an \"exculpation of Hitler's role in the Final Solution\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kershaw|1985|p=268}}.</ref> Other critical responses to his work tend to follow this pattern.\n\nThe description of Irving as a historian, rather than a historical author, is controversial, with some publications since the libel trial continuing to refer to him as a \"historian\"<ref name=\"DI_historian\">e.g. [https://www.theguardian.com/irving/ The Guardian]</ref> or \"disgraced historian\",<ref name=DIdisgraced>Philippe Naughton and agencies in Vienna.
