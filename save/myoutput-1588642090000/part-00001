The episode was written by [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and directed by [[Jeff Melman]]. It originally aired on October 13, 2011 on [[NBC]]. The episode features a housewarming party for Troy and Abed panning out in seven alternate timelines. Each timeline explored the effect of the absence/presence of a character on other characters in similar situations.\n\nConsidered one of the best episodes of the series, \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" received highly positive reviews, with many critics lauding its unconventional structure and noting a significant improvement from the first three episodes of the season. McKenna was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series]] for this episode.\n\n==Plot==\nTroy ([[Donald Glover]]) and Abed ([[Danny Pudi]]) invite the study group to their housewarming party. In particular, they call attention to their ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' boulder escape scene diorama. Once everyone has arrived, they begin playing [[Yahtzee]]. The [[pizza delivery]] man, Toby (Robert Tarpinian), arrives, and someone has to go downstairs to collect the pizza. Everyone agrees to Jeff's ([[Joel McHale]]) plan to roll a [[dice|die]] to determine who has to get the pizza.\n\nThe episode then splits into different [[Timeline|timelines]]\u2014as noted by Abed throughout, to his friends' confusion\u2014with each alternate timeline playing out every possible outcome of the die roll. Every timeline features running gags which end differently depending on which characters are present or absent:\n\n*Britta ([[Gillian Jacobs]]) plays \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" by [[The Police]] on the [[iPod]] stereo system and begins to sing along to it, but Jeff cuts her off.\n*Pierce ([[Chevy Chase]]) attempts to introduce his story about having had sex with [[Eartha Kitt]] in an airplane bathroom into the conversation.\n*Britta excuses herself after Jeff slams her down in order to visit the bathroom to smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] covertly.\n*Annie ([[Alison Brie]]) has a gun in her bag.\n*Pierce gives Troy a housewarming gift, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[troll]] (wrapped in a box), which frightened Troy while he lived in Pierce's mansion earlier in the series.\n*Jeff gets up from the table to get a drink, hitting his head on the ceiling fan in the process. Annie tends to him, while Pierce and Troy laugh at him.\n*Shirley ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) is baking pies in order to curry favor with the group, though the others disapprove of her manipulative tactic of using baking to gain love.\n*The boulder in the ''Indiana Jones'' diorama begins to roll down whenever someone closes the door, but Abed stops it before it reaches the bottom.\n*The pizza man is called ugly or creepy.\n*Abed wonders aloud what happens in all the other timelines, but Jeff dismissively says there are no other timelines.\n\nIn the first timeline, Jeff rolls a two and Annie (who is sitting second on his left around the table) goes to get the pizza. Troy opens Annie's purse to find a gun, and is too distracted to open Pierce's present. Abed confronts Britta about the smell of marijuana in the bathroom, which offends her.\n\nIn the second timeline, Jeff rolls a four and Shirley has to go. She reminds the group to take her pies out of the oven before leaving. Troy opens Pierce's present and freaks out. When Shirley returns, she finds that her pies were left in the oven to burn. She berates the group and leaves.\n\nIn the third timeline, the die lands on three and Pierce has to go. Jeff belittles Troy, which causes him to leave the table and join Britta in the bathroom. She consoles Troy by mocking Jeff's guarded personality. Annie demonstrates her first aid skills when tending to Jeff. When Pierce returns with the pizza, everyone is happy.\n\nIn the fourth timeline, Jeff rolls a six and Britta has to go. Annie tends to Jeff in the bathroom since Britta isn't using it. Jeff expresses his concern for Annie, but just as they are about to kiss, they are interrupted by Troy screaming. Pierce is terrorizing him with the troll, and reveals that he is upset that Troy has moved out from his mansion. Britta returns with the pizza man, doped, and announces they are now engaged.\n\nIn the fifth timeline, Jeff rolls a one and Troy has to go. He leaves in a hurry, so as not to miss anything interesting, and slams the door, which causes the diorama boulder to slip and roll onto the floor. Britta and Abed leave for the bathroom, not noticing the boulder. When Annie stands up, she trips over it and falls on the coffee table, in turn displacing Pierce's bottle of rum, which shatters on the floor. Pierce abruptly rises from the table in reaction to the fall, knocking Annie's purse to the floor. The gun inside discharges and hits Pierce in the thigh, and his blood from the wound sprays Shirley in the face. Abed rushes to help Annie with Pierce, while Britta comes out of the bathroom and goes slack-jawed upon seeing Pierce on the floor; her lit joint drops from her mouth and ignites the spilled rum. Jeff attempts to smother the fire with his shirt, only for it to catch fire itself and get wrapped around Jeff's right arm. Britta attempts to put out the fire by dropping glasses of water onto it. Troy returns to a scene of chaos with the troll doll, having been knocked from the table during the kerfuffle, staring directly at him from amid the flames, causing him to scream in horror.\n\nIn the sixth timeline, Jeff rolls a five, meaning Abed has to go. Forgetting the others' refusal to eat Shirley's pies, Britta does so, at the same time inadvertently revealing that she smoked marijuana, to Shirley's great dismay, and they confront each other about their respective \"habits\". Troy says a few kind words to Pierce, which causes Pierce to attempt to rescind the gift. In the ensuing struggle, the troll is flung out of the box. Jeff and Annie kiss at the kitchen counter, but Annie kills the mood inadvertently by saying that Jeff's actions remind her of her father; he belittles her for the remark and for using too much lip gloss. Abed returns to an awkward situation but acts obliviously (\"I hope this is the real [timeline] because I just found a nickel in the hallway\").\n\nIn the final, prime<ref name=\"HarmonTumblr\">{{cite web |title=Dan Harmon's Tumblr |url=http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/11469117959/fine-were-geniuses-but-not-evil-geniuses |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}</ref> timeline, Abed stops the die from rolling and urges the group to stay united regardless of whatever happens to them. He then points out that Jeff (using a six-sided die for seven people) devised a system in which he would never be selected, resulting in the group berating Jeff for his deception. In the end, Jeff has to get the pizza. After he leaves (hitting his head as he stands) and Britta puts on \"Roxanne\", the five other group members sing and dance to the song. Pierce decides not to give Troy his gift and discards the doll. Abed invites Annie to move in with him and Troy.\n\nThe end tag shows the universe in which Troy got the pizza. With the (remaining) group members sitting around the study table, it is revealed that Pierce is dead, Annie has been institutionalized after going insane with guilt for having indirectly caused it, Shirley is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], Troy injured his larynx trying to destroy the flaming troll (he tried to eat it) and can only speak with the assistance of an artificial voice box, Jeff is missing an arm, and Britta has a blue streak in her hair. Abed declares that, as this is \"the darkest timeline\", they must become \"the evil study group\" and find a way to enter the \"prime timeline\" and take control over it. He hands out black felt goatees to the others, mimicking the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]\". Depressed, Britta, Jeff, and Shirley depart, but Troy stays behind; he and Abed don the goatees, singing \"Evil Troy and Evil Abed,\" a variation on the series\u2019 running gag of \"Troy and Abed in the Morning.\" Suddenly, the scene changes via the reverse of the dice roll animation used throughout the episode (the camera zooms out from that timeline to the prime timeline at the center this time) to the \"prime\" Abed and Troy watching TV, where Abed mentions that something felt strange for a moment, but dismisses it without a thought.\n==Production==\n[[File:Chris McKenna at Wondercon 2012.jpg|thumb|225px|right|This episode was Chris McKenna's sixth writing credit for ''Community''.]]\n\n\"Remedial Chaos Theory\" was broadcast as the fourth episode of the third season.

In particular, they call attention to their ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' boulder escape scene diorama. Once everyone has arrived, they begin playing [[Yahtzee]]. The [[pizza delivery]] man, Toby (Robert Tarpinian), arrives, and someone has to go downstairs to collect the pizza. Everyone agrees to Jeff's ([[Joel McHale]]) plan to roll a [[dice|die]] to determine who has to get the pizza.\n\nThe episode then splits into different [[Timeline|timelines]]\u2014as noted by Abed throughout, to his friends' confusion\u2014with each alternate timeline playing out every possible outcome of the die roll. Every timeline features running gags which end differently depending on which characters are present or absent:\n\n*Britta ([[Gillian Jacobs]]) plays \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" by [[The Police]] on the [[iPod]] stereo system and begins to sing along to it, but Jeff cuts her off.\n*Pierce ([[Chevy Chase]]) attempts to introduce his story about having had sex with [[Eartha Kitt]] in an airplane bathroom into the conversation.\n*Britta excuses herself after Jeff slams her down in order to visit the bathroom to smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] covertly.\n*Annie ([[Alison Brie]]) has a gun in her bag.\n*Pierce gives Troy a housewarming gift, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[troll]] (wrapped in a box), which frightened Troy while he lived in Pierce's mansion earlier in the series.\n*Jeff gets up from the table to get a drink, hitting his head on the ceiling fan in the process. Annie tends to him, while Pierce and Troy laugh at him.\n*Shirley ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) is baking pies in order to curry favor with the group, though the others disapprove of her manipulative tactic of using baking to gain love.\n*The boulder in the ''Indiana Jones'' diorama begins to roll down whenever someone closes the door, but Abed stops it before it reaches the bottom.\n*The pizza man is called ugly or creepy.\n*Abed wonders aloud what happens in all the other timelines, but Jeff dismissively says there are no other timelines.\n\nIn the first timeline, Jeff rolls a two and Annie (who is sitting second on his left around the table) goes to get the pizza. Troy opens Annie's purse to find a gun, and is too distracted to open Pierce's present. Abed confronts Britta about the smell of marijuana in the bathroom, which offends her.\n\nIn the second timeline, Jeff rolls a four and Shirley has to go. She reminds the group to take her pies out of the oven before leaving. Troy opens Pierce's present and freaks out. When Shirley returns, she finds that her pies were left in the oven to burn. She berates the group and leaves.\n\nIn the third timeline, the die lands on three and Pierce has to go. Jeff belittles Troy, which causes him to leave the table and join Britta in the bathroom. She consoles Troy by mocking Jeff's guarded personality. Annie demonstrates her first aid skills when tending to Jeff. When Pierce returns with the pizza, everyone is happy.\n\nIn the fourth timeline, Jeff rolls a six and Britta has to go. Annie tends to Jeff in the bathroom since Britta isn't using it. Jeff expresses his concern for Annie, but just as they are about to kiss, they are interrupted by Troy screaming. Pierce is terrorizing him with the troll, and reveals that he is upset that Troy has moved out from his mansion. Britta returns with the pizza man, doped, and announces they are now engaged.\n\nIn the fifth timeline, Jeff rolls a one and Troy has to go. He leaves in a hurry, so as not to miss anything interesting, and slams the door, which causes the diorama boulder to slip and roll onto the floor. Britta and Abed leave for the bathroom, not noticing the boulder. When Annie stands up, she trips over it and falls on the coffee table, in turn displacing Pierce's bottle of rum, which shatters on the floor. Pierce abruptly rises from the table in reaction to the fall, knocking Annie's purse to the floor. The gun inside discharges and hits Pierce in the thigh, and his blood from the wound sprays Shirley in the face. Abed rushes to help Annie with Pierce, while Britta comes out of the bathroom and goes slack-jawed upon seeing Pierce on the floor; her lit joint drops from her mouth and ignites the spilled rum. Jeff attempts to smother the fire with his shirt, only for it to catch fire itself and get wrapped around Jeff's right arm. Britta attempts to put out the fire by dropping glasses of water onto it. Troy returns to a scene of chaos with the troll doll, having been knocked from the table during the kerfuffle, staring directly at him from amid the flames, causing him to scream in horror.\n\nIn the sixth timeline, Jeff rolls a five, meaning Abed has to go. Forgetting the others' refusal to eat Shirley's pies, Britta does so, at the same time inadvertently revealing that she smoked marijuana, to Shirley's great dismay, and they confront each other about their respective \"habits\". Troy says a few kind words to Pierce, which causes Pierce to attempt to rescind the gift. In the ensuing struggle, the troll is flung out of the box. Jeff and Annie kiss at the kitchen counter, but Annie kills the mood inadvertently by saying that Jeff's actions remind her of her father; he belittles her for the remark and for using too much lip gloss. Abed returns to an awkward situation but acts obliviously (\"I hope this is the real [timeline] because I just found a nickel in the hallway\").\n\nIn the final, prime<ref name=\"HarmonTumblr\">{{cite web |title=Dan Harmon's Tumblr |url=http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/11469117959/fine-were-geniuses-but-not-evil-geniuses |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}</ref> timeline, Abed stops the die from rolling and urges the group to stay united regardless of whatever happens to them. He then points out that Jeff (using a six-sided die for seven people) devised a system in which he would never be selected, resulting in the group berating Jeff for his deception. In the end, Jeff has to get the pizza. After he leaves (hitting his head as he stands) and Britta puts on \"Roxanne\", the five other group members sing and dance to the song. Pierce decides not to give Troy his gift and discards the doll. Abed invites Annie to move in with him and Troy.\n\nThe end tag shows the universe in which Troy got the pizza. With the (remaining) group members sitting around the study table, it is revealed that Pierce is dead, Annie has been institutionalized after going insane with guilt for having indirectly caused it, Shirley is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], Troy injured his larynx trying to destroy the flaming troll (he tried to eat it) and can only speak with the assistance of an artificial voice box, Jeff is missing an arm, and Britta has a blue streak in her hair. Abed declares that, as this is \"the darkest timeline\", they must become \"the evil study group\" and find a way to enter the \"prime timeline\" and take control over it. He hands out black felt goatees to the others, mimicking the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]\". Depressed, Britta, Jeff, and Shirley depart, but Troy stays behind; he and Abed don the goatees, singing \"Evil Troy and Evil Abed,\" a variation on the series\u2019 running gag of \"Troy and Abed in the Morning.\" Suddenly, the scene changes via the reverse of the dice roll animation used throughout the episode (the camera zooms out from that timeline to the prime timeline at the center this time) to the \"prime\" Abed and Troy watching TV, where Abed mentions that something felt strange for a moment, but dismisses it without a thought.\n==Production==\n[[File:Chris McKenna at Wondercon 2012.jpg|thumb|225px|right|This episode was Chris McKenna's sixth writing credit for ''Community''.]]\n\n\"Remedial Chaos Theory\" was broadcast as the fourth episode of the third season.
