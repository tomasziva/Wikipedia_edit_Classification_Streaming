For over two centuries, the designation has been given varying levels of authority and formality. \n\nToday, it is no longer a specific rank within Active Duty or Reserve ranks, but it continues to be used as an ''honorary title'' within the [[U.S. Navy]] and the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] for those senior [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]]s (pay grade O-6) in command of operational organizations composed of multiple independent subordinate naval units (e.g., multiple independent ships or aviation squadrons). \n\nHowever, Commodore is a rank that is actively used to this day in the [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary]] , the civilian volunteer branch of the Coast Guard, for the ranks of District Commodore, Vice National Commodore, and National Commodore.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days===\n[[File:US-Navy-Commodore (1862-1864).svg|thumb|125px|right|19th-century commodore insignia]]\n\nUse of the term \"commodore\" dates from 1775 in the then\u2013[[Continental Navy]], the predecessor of the modern [[U.S. Navy]], when it was established (but not used) as a courtesy title reserved for captains in command of a fleet or squadron.<ref name=\"NCCT6\">''Naval Ceremonies, Customs and Traditions'', 6th ed., CDR Royal W.

Mack, USN (Ret); US Naval Institute, Annapolis, MD; 2004; {{ISBN|1-55750-330-3}}, pp. 261, 266\u2013267, 289\u2013290</ref>\n\nThe first U.S. naval officer to become a commodore was [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]], a senior officer of the Navy, appointed in 1794 after the former [[Continental Navy]] was reorganized into what would become the current [[U.S. Navy]].<ref name=\"NCCT6\"/>\n\nBecause the [[U.S. Congress]] was originally unwilling to authorize more than four officer ranks in the navy (captain, master commandant, lieutenant, and midshipman) until 1862, considerable importance was attached to the title of commodore. Captain [[Isaac Hull]], chafing at not being able to progress further in rank, wrote in 1814 that, if no admirals were to be authorized, something should be done to prevent, \"...every midshipman that has command of a gunboat on a separate station taking upon himself the name of Commodore\".\n\nLike its [[Royal Navy]] counterpart at the time, the U.S. Navy commodore was not a higher rank, but a temporary assignment for navy officers, as [[Herman Melville]] wrote in his 1850 novel, ''[[White-Jacket]]''.<ref name=\"NCCT6\"/>\n\n{{Quote\n|text=An American commodore in the early period, like an English commodore or a French ''[[chef d'escadre]]'', was an officer (generally, but not exclusively, a captain) assigned temporary command of more than one ship. He continued his permanent or regular rank during the assignment.  Once employed as a commodore, however, many jealously held onto the impressive title after their qualifying assignment ended.  The Navy Department tried to discourage such continuing usage because it led to confusion and unnecessary rivalries.\n}}\n\nEventually the title of commodore was defined more strictly, and was reserved for captains so designated by the [[Navy Department]], although the practice of retaining the title for life added some confusion. In 1857, Congress established the grade of [[Flag Officer#United States|flag officer]]. This generic title was intended \"to promote the efficiency of the Navy\", but differed little from the previous practice. Like the courtesy-title commodores, \"flag officers\" reverted to captain once their squadron command assignment was completed.<ref>http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/triv4-5k.htm</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:US-Navy-Commodore (1864-1866).svg|thumb|right|125px|Commodore of the Union Navy, 1864-1865 variant.]]\nBecause of the acute need for officers at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], naval tradition was ignored and commodore became for the first time a permanent commissioned rank in the U.S. Navy. Eighteen commodores were authorized on July 16, 1862. The rank title also lost its \"line command\" status when, in 1863, the chiefs of the bureaus of Medicine and Surgery, Provisions and Clothing, Steam Engineering, and Construction and Repair were all given the rank of commodore.\n\n===Flag officer===\nThe rank of commodore continued in the Navy until March 3, 1899, when \"An Act To reorganize and increase the efficiency and the personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps\" redefined the list of officers on the active list and did not include the rank of commodore, effectively disestablishing the rank for active line officer, but not on the retirement list.<ref>https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/55th-congress/session-3/c55s3ch413.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=CDR Royal W. |author2=VADM William P.

In short, U.S. Navy commodores were not being treated as [[flag officer]]s by other navies, or given the respect that the Navy Department thought was their due.\n\nAs it would have been expensive to increase the pay of all the former commodores to the level of rear admirals, the [[U.S. Congress]] at the time specified that the lower half of the rear admiral list have pay equal to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]]s of the [[U.S. Army]]. If there were an odd number of rear admirals, the lower half of the list was to be the larger. All rear admirals lower half and full rear admirals, were considered equal to major generals, flew a blue flag with the requisite number of stars instead of a broad pennant, and were entitled to a 13-gun salute. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] later held that the rank of commodore had been removed from the U.S. Navy, leaving it without a rank equivalent to brigadier general. This act disgruntled all the brigadier generals, who could now be outranked by officers who were their juniors in terms of service. This was a point of [[interservice rivalry|inter-service controversy]] for many years, especially after 1916, when the U.S. Army made its brigadier generals equivalent to rear admirals (lower half).  Thus the two-star rank of rear admiral was now equal to that of [[Major general (United States)|major general]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/196/327.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|author=|date=|website=Findlaw|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref><ref>Supreme Court of the United States, October Term, 1902; No. 562; ''William C.

However, some Navy and Coast Guard captains, although not yet selected for rear admiral (lower half), were holding commands of significantly higher responsibility than they had earlier and this needed to be recognized. The [[COMINCH]] of the U.S. Navy and [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] (later [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]]) [[Ernest J. King]], proposed bringing back the older rank of \"commodore\" for these officers. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] agreed, making the suggestion that the title be revived.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=CDR Royal W. |author2=VADM William P. Mack |title=Naval Ceremonies, Customs and Traditions |year=2004 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, MD |edition=6th |isbn=1-55750-330-3 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wvKiBiWKrzMC&pg=PA289#v=twopage&q=&f=false 289\u2013290]}}<!--|accessdate=18 June 2013 --></ref>\n\nAs a result, the one-star officer rank for the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard was re-established in April 1943 with the title of \"commodore\".  In actual practice, some officers on admiral's staffs were also promoted to the rank of commodore.  By the end of the [[War in the Pacific]] in August 1945, there were over 100 commodores in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. With respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, it should be understood that during World War II, the much-expanded Coast Guard was transferred from the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] to the [[Department of the Navy]] and was involved in combat operations in both [[anti-submarine warfare]] and [[amphibious warfare]], thousands of miles away from home, and not just in its usual role of defending the coasts of the United States, detaining smugglers, lifesaving, and [[search and rescue]] operations.\n\nAfter World War II, and with the rapid drawdown in size of both the Navy and the Coast Guard, very few of the wartime commodores were ever promoted to rear admiral. All promotions to commodore ceased in 1947, and nearly all of the commodores who had held the one-star rank had either been promoted to rear admiral or had retired from the Navy by 1950. According to the 1949 edition of the Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Navy, updated to January 1st, 1949, the last two commodores on active duty were Tully Shelley (b. 1892) and Antoine O. Rabideau (b. 1884).<ref>Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Navy. 1949. pg. 12.</ref> Shelley retired in July 1949 and was promoted on retirement to rear admiral retroactive to April 3, 1945.<ref>Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Navy. 1950. pg. 403.</ref> Rabideau apparently died sometime in 1949, as he is not listed in the 1950 register as either on active duty or as retired.\n\nHowever, as the [[Cold War]] evolved, the Navy began to rebound from its immediate post-World War II reductions.  This expanding Navy saw growth in several mission areas, and the reintroduction and designation of senior captains in command of units comprising multiple ships (e.g., \"flotillas\"), multiple aviation squadrons or other similar organizations became increasingly commonplace, leading to increased use of the title of commodore for those senior captains occupying these highly responsible positions.\n\n===1982 commodore admiral / 1983 rear admiral (lower half)===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, following years of objections and complaints by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], efforts were begun to reinstate commodore as an official rank in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard with a [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay grade]] of O-7, replacing \"rear admiral (lower half)\", which were Navy and Coast Guard flag officers who were paid at the one-star rank of an O-7 and carried the relative seniority of a one-star officer, but who, due to the elimination of the rank of commodore at the end of World War II, wore the same two-star rank insignia as a full, or \"upper half,\" rear admiral, an O-8.\n\nIn 1982, the rank of commodore was finally and officially reintroduced in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard as the O-7 rank.  This was intended to quell the long-running dissatisfaction by U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Air Force officers with the U.S. Navy's and the U.S. Coast Guard's policy of honoring its rear admirals (lower half), who received the pay grade of [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades#Officer pay grades|O-7]] while wearing the rank insignia of a [[two-star admiral]], i.e., an [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|O-8]].  The one-star officer's rank and insignia for Navy and Coast Guard officers was thence re-established with the initial title of [[commodore admiral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/611|title=10 U.S. Code \u00a7 611 - Convening of selection boards|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5150|title=10 U.S. Code \u00a7 5150 - Staff corps of the Navy|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, following numerous objections by USN officers to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and USCG officers to the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] that this new title was unwieldy and confusing, the rank of \"commodore admiral\" was simplified to \"commodore\".\n\nHowever, this action still failed to stem the confusion and the objections of senior officers in the naval services.  This was because the U.S. Navy had long assigned the title (although not the rank) of commodore to selected captains holding major operational sea-going commands. Since at least the late 1940s, commodore had been used as a \"position title\" for senior navy captains who commanded air groups and air wings (other than those officers commanding carrier air groups/carrier air wings, who were historically known and referred to as \"CAGs\"), destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, amphibious squadrons, patrol boat flotillas, patrol hydrofoil missile ship squadrons, special warfare groups, construction regiments, and other large seagoing commands.  The [[U.S. Coast Guard]] had never previously used the title.\n\nLater in 1983, the one-star U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard admiral rank was changed back to its original O-7 pay grade title of \"rear admiral\" with the discriminator in seniority and protocol purposes of Rear Admiral, lower half, and a rank title abbreviation of RDML versus the O-8 rank title abbreviation of RADM.\n\nFrom then on, commodore has remained a title for U.S. Navy captains in command of more than a single unit (other than captains commanding carrier air wings, who retained their traditional title of \"CAG\") and all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard one-star admirals were subsequently referred to as rear admiral.  The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard [[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral (lower half)|rear admirals (lower half)]], continued to wear the single star for collar insignia and applicable shoulder insignia (i.e., flight suits, jackets, etc.), a single silver star on top of solid gold background shoulder board insignia, and a single broad gold sleeve stripe insignia for dress blue uniforms (service dress blue, full dress blue and dinner dress blue) of all USN and USCG flag officers in pay grade O-7, and for the service dress white and full dress white uniforms of female USN flag officers in pay grade O-7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/uniforms/uniformregulations/Pages/default.aspx|title=Uniform Regulations|author=|date=|website=www.public.navy.mil|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"commodore\" again reverted to that of an honorary title versus an actual rank for the limited number of captains in command of multiple units.\n\n==Present-day title usage==\n\n===Military===\n\n====U.S. Navy====\nThe U.S. Navy no longer maintains a ''rank'' of commodore, but the term has survived as an ''honorary title''.

In the other U.S. armed services, the level and scope of responsibility of a USN Captain in a commodore billet is equivalent to that of the Commanding Officer of a Marine Regiment, Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) or Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) in the U.S. Marine Corps, a wing commander in the U.S. Air Force (even when the USN command is designated as a \"Group\"), or a brigade commander or O-6 level post commander/installation commander in the U.S. Army.\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard====\nThe U.S. Coast Guard presently designates the [[USCG]] [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] commanding those U.S. Coast Guard cutters and other afloat and ashore [[USCG]] units comprising [[PATFORSWA|Patrol Forces Southwest Asia]] ([[PATFORSWA]]) as a \"commodore\".  PATFORSWA is headquartered at [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]] in [[Manama, Bahrain]] and its primary area of responsibility is the [[Persian Gulf]], as well as other areas coinciding with that of [[United States Naval Forces Central Command]] (NAVCENT).  It is currently the only commodore billet in the U.S. Coast Guard and this usage mirrors the [[USN]]'s use of the title \"commodore\".\n\n===Auxiliary Components of Uniformed Services===\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary====\nThe [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]] also employs variants of the ''title'' of commodore.  Members of the Auxiliary are part of the Coast Guard's [[Auxiliaries|uniformed auxiliary service]] who do not have military rank, but who do wear modified U.S. Coast Guard uniforms and U.S. military-style officer rank insignia to indicate office.  Auxiliary members who have been elected to positions in the highest levels of the organization, similar in nature to active and reserve rear admirals and vice admirals use the term commodore (e.g., District Commodore, Assistant National Commodore, Deputy National Commodore, National Commodore, etc.).  These Coast Guard Auxiliarists may permanently append the title commodore, sometimes abbreviated COMO, to their names (e.g., Commodore James A. Smith, National Commodore; or COMO Jim Smith, (NACO)).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg3/cg3pcx/cginfo/uniforms/insignia-national.asp |title=USCGAux Insignia of Office: Flotilla, Division, District and National Offices |date=7 May 2013 |publisher=[[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary|United States Coast Guard Auxiliary Division]] |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> In the 1970s there was an honorary commodore title given to friends and members of the USCG Auxiliary as well as the rank of lifetime member as the Auxiliary organization, which originated as a seafaring militia and counterweight to the USCG in 1941 also liaised with Yacht clubs and other non governmental civilian organizations for the mutual defense.\n\n====U.S. Maritime Service====\nThe [[United States Maritime Service]] uses the rank of commodore for their one-star flag officers, with the two-star rank being simply designated as \"rear admiral\".

Captain [[Isaac Hull]], chafing at not being able to progress further in rank, wrote in 1814 that, if no admirals were to be authorized, something should be done to prevent, \"...every midshipman that has command of a gunboat on a separate station taking upon himself the name of Commodore\".\n\nLike its [[Royal Navy]] counterpart at the time, the U.S. Navy commodore was not a higher rank, but a temporary assignment for navy officers, as [[Herman Melville]] wrote in his 1850 novel, ''[[White-Jacket]]''.<ref name=\"NCCT6\"/>\n\n{{Quote\n|text=An American commodore in the early period, like an English commodore or a French ''[[chef d'escadre]]'', was an officer (generally, but not exclusively, a captain) assigned temporary command of more than one ship. He continued his permanent or regular rank during the assignment.  Once employed as a commodore, however, many jealously held onto the impressive title after their qualifying assignment ended.  The Navy Department tried to discourage such continuing usage because it led to confusion and unnecessary rivalries.\n}}\n\nEventually the title of commodore was defined more strictly, and was reserved for captains so designated by the [[Navy Department]], although the practice of retaining the title for life added some confusion. In 1857, Congress established the grade of [[Flag Officer#United States|flag officer]]. This generic title was intended \"to promote the efficiency of the Navy\", but differed little from the previous practice. Like the courtesy-title commodores, \"flag officers\" reverted to captain once their squadron command assignment was completed.<ref>http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/triv4-5k.htm</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:US-Navy-Commodore (1864-1866).svg|thumb|right|125px|Commodore of the Union Navy, 1864-1865 variant.]]\nBecause of the acute need for officers at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], naval tradition was ignored and commodore became for the first time a permanent commissioned rank in the U.S. Navy. Eighteen commodores were authorized on July 16, 1862. The rank title also lost its \"line command\" status when, in 1863, the chiefs of the bureaus of Medicine and Surgery, Provisions and Clothing, Steam Engineering, and Construction and Repair were all given the rank of commodore.\n\n===Flag officer===\nThe rank of commodore continued in the Navy until March 3, 1899, when \"An Act To reorganize and increase the efficiency and the personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps\" redefined the list of officers on the active list and did not include the rank of commodore, effectively disestablishing the rank for active line officer, but not on the retirement list.<ref>https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/55th-congress/session-3/c55s3ch413.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=CDR Royal W. |author2=VADM William P.

In short, U.S. Navy commodores were not being treated as [[flag officer]]s by other navies, or given the respect that the Navy Department thought was their due.\n\nAs it would have been expensive to increase the pay of all the former commodores to the level of rear admirals, the [[U.S. Congress]] at the time specified that the lower half of the rear admiral list have pay equal to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]]s of the [[U.S. Army]]. If there were an odd number of rear admirals, the lower half of the list was to be the larger. All rear admirals lower half and full rear admirals, were considered equal to major generals, flew a blue flag with the requisite number of stars instead of a broad pennant, and were entitled to a 13-gun salute. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] later held that the rank of commodore had been removed from the U.S. Navy, leaving it without a rank equivalent to brigadier general. This act disgruntled all the brigadier generals, who could now be outranked by officers who were their juniors in terms of service. This was a point of [[interservice rivalry|inter-service controversy]] for many years, especially after 1916, when the U.S. Army made its brigadier generals equivalent to rear admirals (lower half).  Thus the two-star rank of rear admiral was now equal to that of [[Major general (United States)|major general]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/196/327.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|author=|date=|website=Findlaw|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref><ref>Supreme Court of the United States, October Term, 1902; No. 562; ''William C.

However, some Navy and Coast Guard captains, although not yet selected for rear admiral (lower half), were holding commands of significantly higher responsibility than they had earlier and this needed to be recognized. The [[COMINCH]] of the U.S. Navy and [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] (later [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]]) [[Ernest J. King]], proposed bringing back the older rank of \"commodore\" for these officers. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] agreed, making the suggestion that the title be revived.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=CDR Royal W. |author2=VADM William P. Mack |title=Naval Ceremonies, Customs and Traditions |year=2004 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, MD |edition=6th |isbn=1-55750-330-3 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wvKiBiWKrzMC&pg=PA289#v=twopage&q=&f=false 289\u2013290]}}<!--|accessdate=18 June 2013 --></ref>\n\nAs a result, the one-star officer rank for the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard was re-established in April 1943 with the title of \"commodore\".  In actual practice, some officers on admiral's staffs were also promoted to the rank of commodore.  By the end of the [[War in the Pacific]] in August 1945, there were over 100 commodores in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. With respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, it should be understood that during World War II, the much-expanded Coast Guard was transferred from the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] to the [[Department of the Navy]] and was involved in combat operations in both [[anti-submarine warfare]] and [[amphibious warfare]], thousands of miles away from home, and not just in its usual role of defending the coasts of the United States, detaining smugglers, lifesaving, and [[search and rescue]] operations.\n\nAfter World War II, and with the rapid drawdown in size of both the Navy and the Coast Guard, very few of the wartime commodores were ever promoted to rear admiral. All promotions to commodore ceased in 1947, and nearly all of the commodores who had held the one-star rank had either been promoted to rear admiral or had retired from the Navy by 1950. According to the 1949 edition of the Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Navy, updated to January 1st, 1949, the last two commodores on active duty were Tully Shelley (b. 1892) and Antoine O. Rabideau (b. 1884).<ref>Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Navy. 1949. pg. 12.</ref> Shelley retired in July 1949 and was promoted on retirement to rear admiral retroactive to April 3, 1945.<ref>Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Navy. 1950. pg. 403.</ref> Rabideau apparently died sometime in 1949, as he is not listed in the 1950 register as either on active duty or as retired.\n\nHowever, as the [[Cold War]] evolved, the Navy began to rebound from its immediate post-World War II reductions.  This expanding Navy saw growth in several mission areas, and the reintroduction and designation of senior captains in command of units comprising multiple ships (e.g., \"flotillas\"), multiple aviation squadrons or other similar organizations became increasingly commonplace, leading to increased use of the title of commodore for those senior captains occupying these highly responsible positions.\n\n===1982 commodore admiral / 1983 rear admiral (lower half)===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, following years of objections and complaints by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], efforts were begun to reinstate commodore as an official rank in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard with a [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay grade]] of O-7, replacing \"rear admiral (lower half)\", which were Navy and Coast Guard flag officers who were paid at the one-star rank of an O-7 and carried the relative seniority of a one-star officer, but who, due to the elimination of the rank of commodore at the end of World War II, wore the same two-star rank insignia as a full, or \"upper half,\" rear admiral, an O-8.\n\nIn 1982, the rank of commodore was finally and officially reintroduced in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard as the O-7 rank.  This was intended to quell the long-running dissatisfaction by U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Air Force officers with the U.S. Navy's and the U.S. Coast Guard's policy of honoring its rear admirals (lower half), who received the pay grade of [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades#Officer pay grades|O-7]] while wearing the rank insignia of a [[two-star admiral]], i.e., an [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|O-8]].  The one-star officer's rank and insignia for Navy and Coast Guard officers was thence re-established with the initial title of [[commodore admiral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/611|title=10 U.S. Code \u00a7 611 - Convening of selection boards|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5150|title=10 U.S. Code \u00a7 5150 - Staff corps of the Navy|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, following numerous objections by USN officers to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and USCG officers to the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] that this new title was unwieldy and confusing, the rank of \"commodore admiral\" was simplified to \"commodore\".\n\nHowever, this action still failed to stem the confusion and the objections of senior officers in the naval services.  This was because the U.S. Navy had long assigned the title (although not the rank) of commodore to selected captains holding major operational sea-going commands. Since at least the late 1940s, commodore had been used as a \"position title\" for senior navy captains who commanded air groups and air wings (other than those officers commanding carrier air groups/carrier air wings, who were historically known and referred to as \"CAGs\"), destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, amphibious squadrons, patrol boat flotillas, patrol hydrofoil missile ship squadrons, special warfare groups, construction regiments, and other large seagoing commands.  The [[U.S. Coast Guard]] had never previously used the title.\n\nLater in 1983, the one-star U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard admiral rank was changed back to its original O-7 pay grade title of \"rear admiral\" with the discriminator in seniority and protocol purposes of Rear Admiral, lower half, and a rank title abbreviation of RDML versus the O-8 rank title abbreviation of RADM.\n\nFrom then on, commodore has remained a title for U.S. Navy captains in command of more than a single unit (other than captains commanding carrier air wings, who retained their traditional title of \"CAG\") and all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard one-star admirals were subsequently referred to as rear admiral.  The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard [[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral (lower half)|rear admirals (lower half)]], continued to wear the single star for collar insignia and applicable shoulder insignia (i.e., flight suits, jackets, etc.), a single silver star on top of solid gold background shoulder board insignia, and a single broad gold sleeve stripe insignia for dress blue uniforms (service dress blue, full dress blue and dinner dress blue) of all USN and USCG flag officers in pay grade O-7, and for the service dress white and full dress white uniforms of female USN flag officers in pay grade O-7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/uniforms/uniformregulations/Pages/default.aspx|title=Uniform Regulations|author=|date=|website=www.public.navy.mil|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"commodore\" again reverted to that of an honorary title versus an actual rank for the limited number of captains in command of multiple units.\n\n==Present-day title usage==\n\n===Military===\n\n====U.S. Navy====\nThe U.S. Navy no longer maintains a ''rank'' of commodore, but the term has survived as an ''honorary title''.

In the other U.S. armed services, the level and scope of responsibility of a USN Captain in a commodore billet is equivalent to that of the Commanding Officer of a Marine Regiment, Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) or Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) in the U.S. Marine Corps, a wing commander in the U.S. Air Force (even when the USN command is designated as a \"Group\"), or a brigade commander or O-6 level post commander/installation commander in the U.S. Army.\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard====\nThe U.S. Coast Guard presently designates the [[USCG]] [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] commanding those U.S. Coast Guard cutters and other afloat and ashore [[USCG]] units comprising [[PATFORSWA|Patrol Forces Southwest Asia]] ([[PATFORSWA]]) as a \"commodore\".  PATFORSWA is headquartered at [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]] in [[Manama, Bahrain]] and its primary area of responsibility is the [[Persian Gulf]], as well as other areas coinciding with that of [[United States Naval Forces Central Command]] (NAVCENT).  It is currently the only commodore billet in the U.S. Coast Guard and this usage mirrors the [[USN]]'s use of the title \"commodore\".\n\n===Auxiliary Components of Uniformed Services===\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary====\nThe [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]] also employs variants of the ''title'' of commodore.  Members of the Auxiliary are part of the Coast Guard's [[Auxiliaries|uniformed auxiliary service]] who do not have military rank, but who do wear modified U.S. Coast Guard uniforms and U.S. military-style officer rank insignia to indicate office.  Auxiliary members who have been elected to positions in the highest levels of the organization, similar in nature to active and reserve rear admirals and vice admirals use the term commodore (e.g., District Commodore, Assistant National Commodore, Deputy National Commodore, National Commodore, etc.).  These Coast Guard Auxiliarists may permanently append the title commodore, sometimes abbreviated COMO, to their names (e.g., Commodore James A. Smith, National Commodore; or COMO Jim Smith, (NACO)).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg3/cg3pcx/cginfo/uniforms/insignia-national.asp |title=USCGAux Insignia of Office: Flotilla, Division, District and National Offices |date=7 May 2013 |publisher=[[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary|United States Coast Guard Auxiliary Division]] |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> In the 1970s there was an honorary commodore title given to friends and members of the USCG Auxiliary as well as the rank of lifetime member as the Auxiliary organization, which originated as a seafaring militia and counterweight to the USCG in 1941 also liaised with Yacht clubs and other non governmental civilian organizations for the mutual defense.\n\n====U.S. Maritime Service====\nThe [[United States Maritime Service]] uses the rank of commodore for their one-star flag officers, with the two-star rank being simply designated as \"rear admiral\".
