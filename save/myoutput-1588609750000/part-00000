George Whitehill Chamberlain and his wife Mary Annesley founded a private grammar school inside their home. The classes were held in their living room and, a few years later, the \"American School\" was established as a center of excellence in S\u00e3o Paulo. The Chamberlains' American School was revolutionary for the Brazilian standards at that time: no corporal punishment on students was permitted, and both boys and girls could attend classes. Even though the Chamberlains were openly Presbyterians, students from all ethnic backgrounds, social classes, and religious denominations were welcome. The fame of academic rigor allied to religious tolerance soon reached the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1896, John Theron Mackenzie, an attorney from Phelps, New York, and his sisters donated US$50,000 \"for the establishment of an engineering school to be built under the auspices of Mr. Chamberlain\". The Mackenzie building was built the next year, and the college was named in their honor.\n\nAfter the establishment of Mackenzie College, the institution saw rapid expansion of its activities with the creation of a School of Architecture, a School of Economics, and a Law School, gaining the status of university in 1952.\n[[Image:Mackenzie University (1).jpg|290px|thumb|S\u00e3o Paulo Campus at night]]\n[[File:Edif\u00edcio Jo\u00e3o Calvino.JPG|thumb|290px|Jo\u00e3o Calvino Building, which hosts the university's post-graduation facilities.]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\nIn 130 years of history (as of 2000), it is estimated that Mackenzie University has 300,000 alumni, many of them important personalities of Brazilian politics and civil society.
