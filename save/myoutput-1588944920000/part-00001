{"title_page": "Punk in Sweden", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=August 2010}}\n'''[[Punk rock]]''' and '''[[hardcore punk]]''' have created a [[punk subculture]] in [[Sweden]] since punk music became popular in the 1970s. The most famous Swedish punk band was [[Ebba Gr\u00f6n]], followed by [[KSMB (band)|KSMB]]; other notable bands were [[Asta Kask]], [[Kriminella Gitarrer]], [[Tant Strul]], [[Pink champagne]] , [[The Pain (band)|The Pain]] and [[G\u00f6teborg Sound]]. In the 1980s [[hardcore punk]], [[k\u00e4ngpunk]] and [[raw punk]] became popular in Sweden. The two perhaps most influential bands are [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Some other examples of influential bands are [[Moderat Likvidation]], [[Black Uniforms]], [[Totalit\u00e4r]] and [[Avskum]]. Together with the early American hardcore bands and the British band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], the Swedish punk scene since the early 1990s consisted almost exclusively of \"tribute bands\" to the above. In the 1990s the aggressive punk scene turned more towards crust punk with bands like [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]], [[Skitsystem]], [[Wolfbrigade]], and [[Disfear]].\n\nThe genre is in Sweden also connected with the hardcore scene that emerged in [[Ume\u00e5]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Ume\u00e5) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Lule\u00e5]]) in the lead. Refused had a strong base in the genre's traditional roots and may in part represent how it sounded then, but experimented and stretched the limits sufficiently to their most famous songs rather have come under the term post-hardcore.\n\nThe majority of the genre called [[melodic hardcore]] influenced later [[skate punk]]/[[pop punk]] into what it became in the 1990s. \n\nThere is also a Swedish subgenre called ''[[trallpunk]]'', with its roots in '80s melodic punkbands and raw punk bands like Asta Kask, Total Egon, Strebers, Charta 77, Puke, Rolands Gossk\u00f6r and S\u00f6tlimpa, etc. Many of these early trallpunk bands had a powerful folk music undertone and a style of music with catchy melodies, fast drum speed and narrative texts, often left-wing political lyrics, and unlike the more aggressive hardcore punk, straight to the point lyrics. Notable trallpunk bands include [[De lyckliga kompisarna]], [[Strebers]], [[Dia Psalma]], [[Charta 77]], [[Coca Carola]], [[R\u00e4serbajs]], [[k\u00f6ttgrottorna]],  [[Radioaktiva R\u00e4ker]]. later trallpunk bands took inspiration from American skatepunk and play a mix between the two. For example Skumdum. \n\nIn the 2000s many old Swedish punk bands such as Asta Kask, Dia Psalma, Mob 47, Moderat Likvidation and De lyckliga kompisarna reunited with most of them releasing new albums with new songs. This decade many hardcore punk bands from Ume\u00e5 and northern Sweden started to play more pop-influenced punk and the early Swedish punk like Ebba Gr\u00f6n and KSMB, for example [[Invasionen]] with [[Dennis Lyxz\u00e9n]] from Refused and [[Knugen Faller]] with Inge Johansson from [[Totalt j\u00e4vla m\u00f6rker]].\n\n==Notable bands==\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\n* [[Ebba Gr\u00f6n]]\n* [[Anti Cimex]]\n* [[Disarm (band)]]\n* [[Mob 47]]\n* [[KSMB (band)|KSMB]]\n* [[Incest Brothers]]\n* [[Attentat (band)|Attentat]]\n* [[Rude Kids]]\n* [[Kriminella Gitarrer]]\n* [[Warheads (band)|Warheads]]\n* [[Asta Kask]]\n* [[Sighstens Grannar]]\n* [[Tant Strul]]\n* [[Totalit\u00e4r]]\n* [[Avskum]]\n* [[Strebers]]\n* [[De lyckliga kompisarna]]\n* [[Charta 77 (band)|Charta 77]]\n\n===1990s===\n* [[Abhinanda]]\n* [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]]\n* [[Skitsystem]]\n* [[Wolfbrigade]]\n* [[Disfear]]\n* [[Refused]]\n* [[Raised Fist]]\n* [[Abhinanda]]\n* [[Radioaktiva r\u00e4ker]]\n* [[Satanic Surfers]]\n* [[Dia Psalma]]\n* [[Millencolin]]\n* Skumdum\n* [[Outlast]]\n* [[No Fun At All]]\n* [[Randy (band)|Randy]]\n\n===2000s===\n* [[Invasionen]]\n* [[Knugen Faller]]\n* [[Masshysteri]]\n* [[Suis La Lune]]\n* [[Makthaverskan]]\n* [[Disconvenience]]\n* [[Snorting Maradonas]]\n* [[Fornicators]]\n* [[Honn\u00f6r SS]]\n* [[Shuvit]]\n\n==Notable labels==\n*[[Birdnest Records]] - started by Charta 77's Per Granberg\n\n==References==\n* Svensk punk 1977-81 - Varf\u00f6r tror du vi l\u00e5ter som vi l\u00e5ter?\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Punk}}\n\n[[Category:Punk by country|Sweden]]\n[[Category:Swedish music]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=August 2010}}\n'''[[Punk rock]]''' and '''[[hardcore punk]]''' have created a [[punk subculture]] in [[Sweden]] since punk music became popular in the 1970s.
