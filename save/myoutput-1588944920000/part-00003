It was last assigned to the [[401st Operations Group]] at [[Torrejon Air Base]], Spain, where it was inactivated on 1 January 1992.\n\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''614th Bombardment Squadron'''.  After training in the United States it moved to England, where it participated in the [[strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign]] against Germany.  It earned two [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]s for combat action.  Following [[V-E Day]], the squadron was inactivated in England.  It was briefly active in the [[military reserve force|reserves]] from 1947 to 1949, but does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped.\n\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''614th Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' and activated in 1954 at [[Alexandria Air Force Base]], Louisiana.  After temporary deployments to Southeast Asia, the squadron moved to [[Phan Rang Air Base]], South Vietnam.  It engaged in combat operations until being withdrawn from the theater and moving to  [[Torrejon Air Base]], Spain, where it continued fighter operations until inactivating in 1992, as the Air Force withdrew permanently stationed units from Spain.  Shortly before inactivating, its planes and pilots were used to man a provisional organization during [[Operation Desert Storm]].\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n====Organization and training for combat====\nThe '''614th Bombardment Squadron''' was activated March 1943 at [[Ephrata Army Air Base]] Washington as one of the original squadrons of the [[401st Bombardment Group]].<ref name=Maurer614BS/><ref name=Maurer401BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 285\u2013286</ref>  The initial [[en cadre|cadre]] for the squadron was drawn from the [[395th Bombardment Group]] at Ephrata and the [[383d Bombardment Group]] at [[Rapid City Army Air Field]], South Dakota.  The cadre soon departed for [[Orlando Army Air Base]], Florida, where they conducted simulated combat missions with the [[Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics]] out of [[Brooksville Army Air Field]].<ref>Closway, p. 44</ref>\n\nThe ground echelon moved to [[Geiger Field]], Washington, in May 1943 and to [[Great Falls Army Air Base]], Montana in July.  At Great Falls the first combat crews were assigned to the squadron.<ref>Closway, pp. 44\u201345</ref>  In the final stage of training the squadrons dispersed with the 614th training at [[Glasgow Army Air Field]].<ref name=Closway45>Closway, p. 45</ref>\n\nAfter completing training the ground echelon left for overseas on 19 October 1943. After staging at [[Camp Shanks]], New York, they embarked on the {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and sailed on 27 October disembarking at [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] on 3 November 1943. The air echelon staged for deployment at [[Scott Air Force Base|Scott Field]], Illinois, then flew to England under the control of [[Air Transport Command]] via Newfoundland, Iceland and Scotland.<ref name=Closway45/>\n\n====Combat in the European Theater====\n[[File:614th Bombardment Squadron - B-17 Flying Fortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-17G Flying Fortress<ref group=note>Aircraft is Vega built Boeing B-17G-1-VE Flying Fortress, serial 42-39847 \"Battlin' Betty\".  This aircraft was shot down by flak and fighters on the 11 April 1944 mission to bomb the synthetic oil refinery at Politz/Sorau. The entire crew became [[Prisoners of War]].  The photo was taken at RAF Deenethorpe.</ref>]]\nOn arrival in England, half of the 401st group's [[aircrew]]s were immediately reassigned to the [[351st Bombardment Group]].<ref name=Closway45/>  The rest of the squadron became part of [[Eighth Air Force]] at [[RAF Deenethorpe]]. The 614th became part of the [[92d Combat Bombardment Wing]] of the [[1st Bombardment Division]]. Its tail code was '''Triangle-S'''.{{Cn|date=May 2020}}\n\nOn 26 November the 614th flew its first combat mission against [[Bremen]], Germany.<ref>Closway, p. 46</ref>  The 401st group did not suffer the combat loss of an airplane until its ninth mission on 30 December.<ref>Closway, p. 47</ref>   The squadron operated chiefly against [[strategic bombing|strategic targets]], bombing industries, submarine facilities, shipyards, missile sites, marshalling yards, and [[airfield]]s.<ref name=Maurer401BG/>  On 11 January 1944 the squadron was in the lead group of the '''1st Bombardment Division''' in an attack against aircraft manufacturing facilities at [[Oschersleben]], Germany.  Although the bombers were able to attack, poor weather conditions prevented the division from receiving effective fighter cover.  For over three hours the bomber formation suffered more than 400 attacks by [[Luftwaffe]] fighters, including [[air-to-air rocket]] attacks.  Despite these attacks the unit continued its attack and struck a telling blow against German aircraft production for which the squadron was awarded a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).<ref name=Maurer401BG/><ref>Closway, pp. 40, 47, 62 (reproducing War Department General Order 50, 17 June 1944)</ref>\n\nA little over a month later, on 20 February, the squadron earned its second DUC for an attack on the [[Erla Maschinenwerke]] aircraft manufacturing facilities in [[Leipzig]], Germany.  Despite [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] attacks and battle damage to the 614th's planes, 100% of the unit's bombs fell within 1000 feet of the aiming point.<ref name=Maurer401BG/><ref>Closway, pp. 40, 63 (reproducing War Department General Order 83, 2 October 1945)</ref>  Beginning in October 1944, the unit concentrated its attacks on Axis oil reserves.<ref name=Maurer401BG/>\n\nIn addition to strategic missions, squadron operations included attacks on transportation, airfields, and fortifications to support [[Operation Overlord]], the Normandy invasion.  On [[D-Day]] the 614th attacked Normandy beachhead areas dropping bombs five minutes before troops landed.<ref>Closway. p. 43</ref>   The following month it provided [[close air support]] for [[Operation Cobra]], the breakthrough at [[Saint-L\u00f4]], it also supported the siege of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in August and [[Operation Market Garden]] in September.  During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944 and January 1945, the unit attacked transportation and communications in the battle area.  It supported airborne forces involved in [[Operation Varsity]], the airborne assault across the [[Rhine]] in March 1945.<ref name=Maurer401BG/>\n\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission on 20 April 1945 against [[Brandenberg]].<ref>Closway, p. 55</ref> It had flown 254 combat missions from Deenethorpe airfield.<ref>Closway, p. 62</ref>   After [[V-E Day]], the squadron flew missions to [[Linz]], Austria to evacuate British and French prisoners of war.  It also flew '''Trolley''' sightseeing missions at low level, flying ground support personnel over the [[Ruhr]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] to see the damage that had been done as a result of their efforts.<ref>Closway, pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nThe unit was alerted for redeployment to the Pacific Theater and the last plane departed Deenethorpe in early June.  The ground echelon sailed on the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]] on the fifth.<ref>Closway, p. 58</ref> Upon arrival in the US, personnel were granted thirty days leave, reassembling at [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], South Dakota, but plans had changed and personnel were either transferred to [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] units or processed for discharge and the squadron was inactivated.<ref>Closway, p. 59</ref>\n\n===Reserve operations===\nThe squadron was activated at Brooks Field (later [[Brooks Air Force Base]]), Texas in January 1947 as a unit of the [[military reserve force|reserves]].  It trained under the supervision of the 178th AAF Base Unit (later 2593d Air Force Reserve Training Center) of [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC).<ref>''See'' Mueller, p. 54</ref>  It is not clear whether or not the squadron was fully staffed or equipped. <ref>''See'' Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 685\u2013686 (no aircraft listed as assigned to the squadron from 1947 to 1949)</ref>  In 1948, [[Continental Air Command]] assumed responsibility for managing reserve and [[Air National Guard]] units from ADC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/896/983.xml |title=Abstract, Mission Project Closeup, Continental Air Command|date=27 December 1961|publisher=Air Force History Index|url-status=live |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>  President [[Harry S.

Initially equipped with [[North American F-86 Sabre]]s, then with [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]]s, by 1957. the squadron was flying [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]]s as the '''614th Tactical Fighter Squadron'''.<ref name=Maurer614BS/>  The squadron participated in firepower demonstrations [[military exercise]]s and maneuvers,  It also deployed aircraft and personnel to Europe and the Middle East to support [[NATO]].  During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the squadron operated from [[Homestead Air Force Base]], Florida.  By 1965, however, deployments had begun to the Pacific and Southeast Asia.<ref name=Ravenstein401TFW>Ravenstein, pp. 214\u2013215</ref>  \n\n[[File:North American F-100D-85-NH Super Sabre 56-3408 401 TFW 614TFS abt 1960.jpg|thumb|Squadron F-100D Super Sabre<ref group=note>Aircraft is North American F-100D-85-NH Super Sabre, serial 56-3408.

Shortly after the squadron's arrival at Phan Rang, the 366th Wing moved on paper to [[Da Nang Air Base]], and the [[35th Tactical Fighter Wing]] became the squadron's new headquarters. \nThe squadron continued combat operations in Vietnam until the 35th Wing stood down from combat on 26 June 1971.<ref name=Ravenstein35TFW>Ravenstein, pp. 60\u201363</ref>\n\n====Operations in Europe and the Middle East====\n[[File:614th Tactical Fighter Squadron McDonnell F-4D-31-MC Phantom 66-7768.jpg|thumb|Squadron F-4D Phantom II<ref group=note>Aircraft is McDonnell F-4D-31-MC Phantom II, serial 66-7768 at Torrejon Air Base, Spain, in 1978.

It flew 1303 sorties into Iraq and Kuwait, delivering 3.7 million pounds of weapons. It was the first USAF unit to ever deploy to Qatar. It was inactivated in 1992 as the United States removed its combat units permanently stationed in Spain.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''614th Bombardment

It was last assigned to the [[401st Operations Group]] at [[Torrejon Air Base]], Spain, where it was inactivated on 1 January 1992.\n\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''614th Bombardment Squadron'''.  After training in the United States it moved to England, where it participated in the [[strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign]] against Germany.  It earned two [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]s for combat action.  Following [[V-E Day]], the squadron was inactivated in England.  It was briefly active in the [[military reserve force|reserves]] from 1947 to 1949, but does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped.\n\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''614th Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' and activated in 1954 at [[Alexandria Air Force Base]], Louisiana.  After temporary deployments to Southeast Asia, the squadron moved to [[Phan Rang Air Base]], South Vietnam.  It engaged in combat operations until being withdrawn from the theater and moving to  [[Torrejon Air Base]], Spain, where it continued fighter operations until inactivating in 1992, as the Air Force withdrew permanently stationed units from Spain.  Shortly before inactivating, its planes and pilots were used to man a provisional organization during [[Operation Desert Storm]].\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n====Organization and training for combat====\nThe '''614th Bombardment Squadron''' was activated March 1943 at [[Ephrata Army Air Base]] Washington as one of the original squadrons of the [[401st Bombardment Group]].<ref name=Maurer614BS/><ref name=Maurer401BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 285\u2013286</ref>  The initial [[en cadre|cadre]] for the squadron was drawn from the [[395th Bombardment Group]] at Ephrata and the [[383d Bombardment Group]] at [[Rapid City Army Air Field]], South Dakota.  The cadre soon departed for [[Orlando Army Air Base]], Florida, where they conducted simulated combat missions with the [[Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics]] out of [[Brooksville Army Air Field]].<ref>Closway, p. 44</ref>\n\nThe ground echelon moved to [[Geiger Field]], Washington, in May 1943 and to [[Great Falls Army Air Base]], Montana in July.  At Great Falls the first combat crews were assigned to the squadron.<ref>Closway, pp. 44-45</ref>  In the final stage of training the squadrons dispersed with the 614th training at [[Glasgow Army Air Field]].<ref name=Closway45>Closway, p. 45</ref>\n\nAfter completing training the ground echelon left for overseas on 19 October 1943. After staging at [[Camp Shanks]], New York, they embarked on the {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and sailed on 27 October disembarking at [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] on 3 November 1943. The air echelon staged for deployment at [[Scott Air Force Base|Scott Field]], Illinois, then flew to England under the control of [[Air Transport Command]] via Newfoundland, Iceland and Scotland.<ref name=Closway45/>\n\n====Combat in the European Theater====\n[[File:614th Bombardment Squadron - B-17 Flying Fortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-17G Flying Fortress<ref group=note>Aircraft is Vega built Boeing B-17G-1-VE Flying Fortress, serial 42-39847 \"Battlin' Betty\".  This aircraft was shot down by flak and fighters on the 11 April 1944 mission to bomb the synthetic oil refinery at Politz/Sorau. The entire crew became [[Prisoners of War]].  The photo was taken at RAF Deenethorpe.</ref>]]\nOn arrival in England, half of the 401st group's [[aircrew]]s were immediately reassigned to the [[351st Bombardment Group]].<ref name=Closway45/>  The rest of the squadron became part of [[Eighth Air Force]] at [[RAF Deenethorpe]]. The 614th became part of the [[92d Combat Bombardment Wing]] of the [[1st Bombardment Division]]. Its tail code was '''Triangle-S'''.{{Cn|date=May 2020}}\n\nOn 26 November the 614th flew its first combat mission against [[Bremen]], Germany.<ref>Closway, p. 46</ref>  The 401st group did not suffer the combat loss of an airplane until its ninth mission on 30 December.<ref>Closway, p. 47</ref>   The squadron operated chiefly against [[strategic bombing|strategic targets]], bombing industries, submarine facilities, shipyards, missile sites, marshalling yards, and [[airfield]]s.<ref name=Maurer401BG/>  On 11 January 1944 the squadron was in the lead group of the '''1st Bombardment Division''' in an attack against aircraft manufacturing facilities at [[Oschersleben]], Germany.  Although the bombers were able to attack, poor weather conditions prevented the division from receiving effective fighter cover.  For over three hours the bomber formation suffered more than 400 attacks by [[Luftwaffe]] fighters, including [[air-to-air rocket]] attacks.  Despite these attacks the unit continued its attack and struck a telling blow against German aircraft production for which the squadron was awarded a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).<ref name=Maurer401BG/><ref>Closway, pp. 40, 47, 62 (reproducing War Department General Order 50, 17 June 1944)</ref>\n\nA little over a month later, on 20 February, the squadron earned its second DUC for an attack on the [[Erla Maschinenwerke]] aircraft manufacturing facilities in [[Leipzig]], Germany.  Despite [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] attacks and battle damage to the 614th's planes, 100% of the unit's bombs fell within 1000 feet of the aiming point.<ref name=Maurer401BG/><ref>Closway, pp. 40, 63 (reproducing War Department General Order 83, 2 October 1945)</ref>  Beginning in October 1944, the unit concentrated its attacks on Axis oil reserves.<ref name=Maurer401BG/>\n\nIn addition to strategic missions, squadron operations included attacks on transportation, airfields, and fortifications to support [[Operation Overlord]], the Normandy invasion.  On [[D-Day]] the 614th attacked Normandy beachhead areas dropping bombs five minutes before troops landed.<ref>Closway. p. 43</ref>   The following month it provided [[close air support]] for [[Operation Cobra]], the breakthrough at [[Saint-L\u00f4]], it also supported the siege of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in August and [[Operation Market Garden]] in September.  During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944 and January 1945, the unit attacked transportation and communications in the battle area.  It supported airborne forces involved in [[Operation Varsity]], the airborne assault across the [[Rhine]] in March 1945.<ref name=Maurer401BG/>\n\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission on 20 April 1945 against [[Brandenberg]].<ref>Closway, p. 55</ref> It had flown 254 combat missions from Deenethorpe airfield.<ref>Closway, p. 62</ref>   After [[V-E Day]], the squadron flew missions to [[Linz]], Austria to evacuate British and French prisoners of war.  It also flew '''Trolley''' sightseeing missions at low level, flying ground support personnel over the [[Ruhr]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] to see the damage that had been done as a result of their efforts.<ref>Closway, pp. 56-57</ref>\n\nThe unit was alerted for redeployment to the Pacific Theater and the last plane departed Deenethorpe in early June.  The ground echelon sailed on the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]] on the fifth.<ref>Closway, p. 58</ref> Upon arrival in the US, personnel were granted thirty days leave, reassembling at [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], South Dakota, but plans had changed and personnel were either transferred to [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] units or processed for discharge and the squadron was inactivated.<ref>Closway, p. 59</ref>\n\n===Reserve operations===\nThe squadron was activated at Brooks Field (later [[Brooks Air Force Base]]), Texas in January 1947 as a unit of the [[military reserve force|reserves]].  It trained under the supervision of the 178th AAF Base Unit (later 2593d Air Force Reserve Training Center) of [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC).<ref>''See'' Mueller, p. 54</ref>  It is not clear whether or not the squadron was fully staffed or equipped. <ref>''See'' Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 685-686 (no aircraft listed as assigned to the squadron from 1947 to 1949)</ref>  In 1948, [[Continental Air Command]] assumed responsibility for managing reserve and [[Air National Guard]] units from ADC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/896/983.xml |title=Abstract, Mission Project Closeup, Continental Air Command|date=27 December 1961|publisher=Air Force History Index|url-status=live |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>  President [[Harry S.

Shortly after the squadron's arrival at Phan Rang, the 366th Wing moved on paper to [[Da Nang Air Base]], and the [[35th Tactical Fighter Wing]] became the squadron's new headquarters. \nThe squadron continued combat operations in Vietnam until the 35th Wing stood down from combat on 26 June 1971.<ref name=Ravenstein35TFW>Ravenstein, pp. 60-63</ref>\n\n====Operations in Europe and the Middle East====\n[[File:614th Tactical Fighter Squadron McDonnell F-4D-31-MC Phantom 66-7768.jpg|thumb|Squadron F-4D Phantom II<ref group=note>Aircraft is McDonnell F-4D-31-MC Phantom II, serial 66-7768 at Torrejon Air Base, Spain, in 1978.
