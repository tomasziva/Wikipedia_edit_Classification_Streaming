Another important implication of this includes the ability to get the influenza vaccine while pregnant. During the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, mortality in pregnant women was 45%.

[[Potassium iodide]] in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid.\n*[[Vertically transmitted infection]]\n*Lack of nutrients. For example, lack of folate acid in the [[nutrition in pregnancy]] for humans can result in [[spina bifida]]. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate acid. Folic is added to processed food products, such as flour and breakfast cereals. High levels of un-metabolized folic acid have been associated with several health problems.<ref>https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate</ref>\n*Physical restraint. An example is [[Potter syndrome]] due to [[oligohydramnios]] in humans.\n*[[Genetic disorder]]s\n*[[Alcohol and Pregnancy|Alcohol consumption]] during pregnancy.\n\n==Other animals==\n\n===Fossil record===\n{{Further|Paleopathology}}\nEvidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life's developmental processes. For instance, because a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen has been discovered with a [[block vertebra]], it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, ''[[Troodon]]'', the tip of whose jaw was twisted.<ref name=\"molnar-pathology\">Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D.

For example, the discovery of abnormal flowers\u2014for example, flowers with leaves instead of petals, or flowers with staminoid pistils\u2014furnished important evidence for the \"[[ABC model of flower development|foliar theory]]\", the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves.\n\n===Types of deformations in vegetals===\nPlants can have mutations that leads to different types of deformations such as:\n*[[fasciation]] : development of the apex (growing tip) in a flat plane perpendicular to the axis of elongation,\n*[[variegation]] : degenerescence of genes, manifesting itself among other things by anomalous pigmentation,\n*[[virescence]] : anomalous development of a green pigmentation in unexpected parts of the plant,\n*[[phyllody]] : floral organs or fruits are transformed into leaves,\n*[[witch's broom]] : unusually high multiplication of branches in the upper part of the plant, mainly tree,\n*[[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|pelory]] : zygomorphic flower regress to their ancestral actinomorph symetry,\n*proliferation : repetitive growth of an entire organ like a flower\n\n[[Gall| Galls]] are not part of the vegetal teratology as they are outgrowth due to external factors like insects bites or parasites.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Biology}}\n* [[Carcinogen]]\n* [[Congenital abnormalities]]\n* [[Mutagen]]\n* [[Teratoma]]\n* [[Thalidomide]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.teratology.org/ Society of Teratology]\n*[http://www.etsoc.com/ European Teratology Society]\n*[http://www.otispregnancy.org/ Organization of Teratology Information Specialists]\n*[http://www.marchofdimes.org/ March of Dimes Foundation]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212054644/http://www.nyam.org/library/rare-book-room/exhibits/telling-of-wonders/ A Telling of Wonders: Teratology in Western Medicine through 1800 (New York Academy of Medicine Historical Collections)]\n*[http://www.reprotox.org/ The Reproductive Toxicology Center Database]\n\n{{Biology-footer}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n{{HealthIssuesOfPlastics}}\n\n[[Category:Developmental biology]]\n[[Category:Radiation health effects]]\n[[Category:Teratogens| Teratology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The study of all developmental anomalies}}\n{{Redirect|Teratogenesis|the Revocation extended play|Teratogenesis (EP)}}\n'''Teratology''' is the study of abnormalities of [[physiological development]].

Still, PAE remains the leading cause of birth defects and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the United States, affecting 9.1 to 50 per 1000 live births in the U.S. and 68.0 to 89.2 per 1000 in populations with high levels of alcohol abuse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gordis, M.D. |first1=Enoch |title=Fetal Alcohol Exposure and the Brain |url=https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa50.htm |website=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism}}</ref> \n\nCurrent evidence suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) produces craniofacial malformations via: apoptosis of neural crest cells,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sulik |first1=K.

There has been no association between congenital malformations and vaccination, as shown in Finland in which expecting mothers received the oral polio vaccine and saw no difference in infant outcomes than mothers who had not received the vaccine.<ref name=Harj1993>{{cite journal|last=Harjulehto-Mervaala|first=T|title=Oral Polio Vaccination during Pregnancy: No Increase in the Occurrence of Congenital Malformations|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1993|volume=138|issue=6|pages=407\u2013414|pmid= 8213746|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116873}}</ref> However, it is still not recommended to vaccinate for polio while pregnant unless there is risk of infection <ref>{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html#polio|website=cdc.gov|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|quote=Although no adverse effects of IPV have been documented among pregnant women or their fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided on theoretical grounds.

Another important implication of this includes the ability to get the influenza vaccine while pregnant. During the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, mortality in pregnant women was 45%. However, even with prevention through vaccination, influenza vaccination in pregnant women remains low at 12%. Munoz et al. demonstrated that there was no adverse outcomes observed in the new infants or mothers.<ref name=Mun2005>{{cite journal|last=Munoz|first=F|title=Safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=2005|volume=192|issue=4|pages=1098\u20131106|doi= 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.12.019|pmid=15846187}}</ref>\n\n===Causes===\n{{Further|Congenital disorder}}\nCauses of teratogenesis can broadly be classified as:\n*Toxic substances, such as, for humans, [[drugs in pregnancy]] and [[Environmental toxins and fetal development|environmental toxins in pregnancy]].\n**[[Potassium iodide]] is a possible teratogen. [[Potassium iodide]] in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid.\n*[[Vertically transmitted infection]]\n*Lack of nutrients. For example, lack of folate acid in the [[nutrition in pregnancy]] for humans can result in [[spina bifida]]. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate acid. Folic is added to processed food products, such as flour and breakfast cereals. High levels of un-metabolized folic acid have been associated with several health problems.<ref>https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate</ref>\n*Physical restraint. An example is [[Potter syndrome]] due to [[oligohydramnios]] in humans.\n*[[Genetic disorder]]s\n*[[Alcohol and Pregnancy|Alcohol consumption]] during pregnancy.\n\n==Other animals==\n\n===Fossil record===\n{{Further|Paleopathology}}\nEvidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life's developmental processes. For instance, because a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen has been discovered with a [[block vertebra]], it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, ''[[Troodon]]'', the tip of whose jaw was twisted.<ref name=\"molnar-pathology\">Molnar, R.

For example, the discovery of abnormal flowers\u2014for example, flowers with leaves instead of petals, or flowers with staminoid pistils\u2014furnished important evidence for the \"[[ABC model of flower development|foliar theory]]\", the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves.\n\n===Types of deformations in vegetals===\nPlants can have mutations that leads to different types of deformations such as:\n*[[fasciation]] : development of the apex (growing tip) in a flat plane perpendicular to the axis of elongation,\n*[[variegation]] : degenerescence of genes, manifesting itself among other things by anomalous pigmentation,\n*[[virescence]] : anomalous development of a green pigmentation in unexpected parts of the plant,\n*[[phyllody]] : floral organs or fruits are transformed into leaves,\n*[[witch's broom]] : unusually high multiplication of branches in the upper part of the plant, mainly tree,\n*[[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|pelory]] : zygomorphic flower regress to their ancestral actinomorph symetry,\n*proliferation : repetitive growth of an entire organ like a flower\n\n[[Gall| Galls]] are not part of the vegetal teratology as they are outgrowth due to external factors like insects bites or parasites.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Biology}}\n* [[Carcinogen]]\n* [[Congenital abnormalities]]\n* [[Mutagen]]\n* [[Teratoma]]\n* [[Thalidomide]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.teratology.org/ Society of Teratology]\n*[http://www.etsoc.com/ European Teratology Society]\n*[http://www.otispregnancy.org/ Organization of Teratology Information Specialists]\n*[http://www.marchofdimes.org/ March of Dimes Foundation]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212054644/http://www.nyam.org/library/rare-book-room/exhibits/telling-of-wonders/ A Telling of Wonders: Teratology in Western Medicine through 1800 (New York Academy of Medicine Historical Collections)]\n*[http://www.reprotox.org/ The Reproductive Toxicology Center Database]\n\n{{Biology-footer}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n{{HealthIssuesOfPlastics}}\n\n[[Category:Developmental biology]]\n[[Category:Radiation health effects]]\n[[Category:Teratogens| Teratology]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add commas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology"}
