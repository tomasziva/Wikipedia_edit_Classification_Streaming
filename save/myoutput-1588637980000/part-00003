Rathcoole was 30% Catholic and featured Catholic schools as well as a nominally Catholic but religiously mixed, youth [[association football|football]] club, an unusual circumstance in Northern Ireland, known as Stella Maris, the same as the school Sands attended and where the training was held. Sands was a member of this club and played [[Defender (association football)|left-back]].<ref name=\"oh\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> There was another youth club in nearby Greencastle called Star of the Sea and many boys went there when the Stella Maris club closed.\n\nBy 1966, sectarian violence in Rathcoole, along with the rest of Belfast, had considerably worsened, and the minority Catholic population there found itself under siege. Despite always having had Protestant friends, Sands suddenly found that none of them would even speak to him, and he quickly learned to associate only with Catholics.<ref name=\"oh\"/>\n\nHe left school in 1969 at age 15, and enrolled in Newtownabbey Technical College, beginning an apprenticeship as a [[coach (bus)|coach]] builder at Alexander's Coach Works in 1970.

He was held at gunpoint and told that Alexander's was off-limits to \"[[Fenian]] scum\" and to never come back if he valued his life.

He attended his first [[Provisional IRA]] meeting in Twinbrook that month and joined the IRA the same day. He was 18 years old.

Republican prisoners organised a series of protests seeking to regain their previous [[Special Category Status]], which would free them from some ordinary prison regulations. This began with the \"[[blanket protest]]\" in 1976, in which the prisoners refused to wear prison uniforms and wore blankets instead. In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to \"[[slop out]]\" (i.e., empty their chamber pots), this escalated into the \"[[dirty protest]]\", wherein prisoners refused to wash and smeared the walls of their cells with excrement.<ref name=\"pt0\">Taylo, ''Provos, The IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in'', pp. 251\u201352</ref>\n\n==Published works==\nWhile in prison, Sands had several letters and articles published in the Republican paper ''[[An Phoblacht]]'' under the pseudonym \"Marcella\" (his sister's name).
