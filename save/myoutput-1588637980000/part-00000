Formed in 1968, the band went through several configurations until arriving at its longest and classic line-up when Peart replaced original drummer [[John Rutsey]] in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first tour of the United States.\n\nRush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, [[fantasy]], and philosophy. The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers. In the early 1990s, Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound, which continued for the rest of their career. Rush announced plans to cease large-scale touring at the end of 2015, following the conclusion of their [[R40 Live Tour]]. After nearly three years of an uncertain future, Lifeson reluctantly announced in January 2018 that the band was not going to continue.<ref name=\"blabbermouth.net\">{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rush-guitarist-alex-lifeson-we-have-no-plans-to-tour-or-record-any-more-were-basically-done/|title=RUSH Guitarist ALEX LIFESON: \"We Have No Plans To Tour Or Record Anymore.

To achieve a broader, more progressive sound, Lifeson began to experiment with [[Classical guitar|classical]] and [[twelve-string guitar]]s, and Lee added [[Moog Taurus|bass-pedal synthesizers]] and [[Minimoog]]. Likewise, Peart's percussion became diversified in the form of [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], [[glockenspiel]], wood blocks, [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], [[timpani]], [[gong]], and [[tubular bell|chimes]]. Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with the progressive rock trends by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. As the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of its older styles of music in favour of shorter and sometimes softer arrangements. The lyrics up to this point were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist [[Ayn Rand]], as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song \"Anthem\" from ''Fly By Night'' and a specifically acknowledged derivation in ''2112'' (1976).<ref>2112 and Ayn Rand [http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#62 Rush FAQ].

The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee's multi-layered synthesizer work.  While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the mid-to-late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and razor-thin leads. ''Hold Your Fire'' represents both an extension of the guitar stylings found on ''Power Windows'', and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.<ref>Hold Your Fire Review [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17147|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic, Eduardo Rivadavia].

Produced by record engineer and musician [[Rupert Hine]], these two albums saw Rush shedding much of its keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with ''Presto'' (1989), the band opted for arrangements notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used in many songs, the instrument was no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush's compositions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |title=Presto |work=Allmusic.com |author=Gregory Heaney |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref> Continuing this trend, ''Roll the Bones'' (1991) extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated traces of other musical styles. \"Roll the Bones\", for example exhibits funk and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] elements, and the instrumental track \"[[Rush instrumentals#Where's My Thing?|Where's My Thing?]]\" features several jazz components.<ref>''Roll the Bones'' [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17152|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic:].

To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound \"events\" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to \"play\" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on [[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]], their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}\n\nA staple of Rush's concerts was a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart had used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called \"diversions\".

Formed in 1968, the band went through several configurations until arriving at its longest and classic line-up when Peart replaced original drummer [[John Rutsey]] in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first tour of the United States.\n\nRush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, [[fantasy]], and philosophy. The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers. In the early 1990s, Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound, which continued for the rest of their career. Rush announced plans to cease large-scale touring at the end of 2015, following the conclusion of their [[R40 Live Tour]]. After nearly three years of an uncertain future, Lifeson reluctantly announced in January 2018 that the band was not going to continue.<ref name=\"blabbermouth.net\">{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rush-guitarist-alex-lifeson-we-have-no-plans-to-tour-or-record-any-more-were-basically-done/|title=RUSH Guitarist ALEX LIFESON: \"We Have No Plans To Tour Or Record Anymore.

Peart's daughter Selena died in a car crash in August 1997, followed by the death of his wife Jacqueline from cancer in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which he travelled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering {{convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound \"events\" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to \"play\" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on [[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]], their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}\n\nA staple of Rush's concerts was a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart had used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called \"diversions\". These props have included washing machines, vintage popcorn poppers, or animations and inflatable rabbits emerging from giant hats behind the band.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Joyce|first1=Mike|title=Colorful Diversions From Rush|work=The Washington Post|date=May 9, 1990}}</ref> Starting in the mid-90s, the props often took up Lee's side of the stage ([[Blocking (stage)|stage left]]) as a way to balance out the amp stacks on Lifeson's side (stage right) when Lee opted to use a venue's house system instead of amps.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nRush actively participates in philanthropic causes. The band was one of several hometown favourites to play [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]], also dubbed SARStock, at [[Downsview Park]] in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people.
