{"title_page": "Units of the British Army", "text_new": "{{British Army}}\nThe '''units of the [[British Army]]''' are commanded by the Chief of the General Staff. This is broadly similar to the structures of the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]], in that the four-star (general-equivalent) [[commanders-in-chief]] have been eliminated since 2011 and service chiefs are given direct command of their respective services are responsible as Top Level Budget (TLB) holders.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27408/defence_reform_report_struct_mgt_mod_27june2011.pdf |title=Defence Reform: an independent report into the structure and management of the Ministry of Defence (June 2011) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1 June 2011 |website=gov.uk |publisher=Ministry of Defence |access-date=21 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> [[Army Headquarters (United Kingdom)|Army Headquarters]] is located in Andover, Hampshire. There is a [[Commander Field Army]] and a personnel and UK operations command, [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]].\n\nThe command structure is hierarchical with [[division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s controlling groupings of units from an administrative perspective. Major Units are [[regiment]] or [[battalion]]-sized with minor units being either [[Company (military unit)|company]] sized sub-units or [[platoon]]s. All units within the service are either Regular (full-time) or [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (full-time or part-time), or a combination with sub-units of each type.\n\nNaming conventions of units differ for traditional British historical reasons, creating a significant opportunity for confusion; an [[infantry]] battalion is equivalent to a [[cavalry]] regiment. An infantry regiment is an administrative and ceremonial organisation only, and may include several battalions. For operational tasks, a [[battlegroup (army)|battle group]] will be formed around a combat unit, supported by units or sub-units from other areas. An example would be a squadron of tanks attached to an armoured infantry battle group, together with a reconnaissance troop, artillery battery and engineering support.\n\nSince the 1957 Defence Review, the size of the Army has consistently shrunk. A comparison of the [[List of British Army Regiments (1962)]], the [[List of British Army Regiments (1994)]] and the [[List of British Army Regiments (2008)]] will show the steep decline in the number of infantry and armoured regiments. Since 1990, reductions have been almost constant, through succeeding defence reviews: [[Options for Change]] (1990), [[Front Line First]] (1994), the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, [[Delivering Security in a Changing World]] (2003), and the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]] of 2010. However, the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|2015 Review]] indicated no change from the personnel number targets set in 2010.\n\n==Army Headquarters==\nThrough a major army reorganisation effective 1 November 2011, the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] took direct command of the Army through a new structure, based at [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]<ref>[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/92060/response/228969/attach/3/20111121%20FOI%20Cross%20Response%20V2%20U.pdf Correspondence from Army Secretariat]</ref> and known as \"[[Army Headquarters (United Kingdom)|Army Headquarters]]\".<ref name=intel>[http://www.dmilt.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2506:uk-army-command-reorganization&catid=1:europe&Itemid=57 Army Command reorganization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112055548/http://www.dmilt.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2506%3Auk-army-command-reorganization&catid=1%3Aeurope&Itemid=57 |date=2011-11-12 }} Defence Marketing Intelligence, 10 November 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/142.aspx Higher Command] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605053921/http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/142.aspx |date=2013-06-05 }}</ref>\n\nReporting to the Chief of the General Staff are four [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]]s: the [[Deputy Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]]; the [[Commander Field Army]] (CFA); the Commander [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]] (CHC), and Commander [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]]. The CFA is responsible for generating and preparing forces for current and contingency operations; he commands [[1st (United Kingdom) Division]], [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd (United Kingdom) Division]], [[6th (United Kingdom) Division]] and [[Joint Helicopter Command]] (JHC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/media/2400/armystructure_landscape_v4-01.png|title=Army Structure|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\nCHC is responsible for commanding a wide variety or organisations that both contribute to the administrative running of the Army (i.e. the Army Personnel Centre (APC) in Glasgow), and focuses on the 'home base' (i.e. [[Regional Command (British Army)|Regional Command]]).\n\n==Formations==\n\n===Commands===\nA [[Command (military formation)|command]] is a military formation that handles a specific task or region, and can direct forces as large as multiple corps or as little as a few battalions. Previously the Army had regional commands in the UK, including [[Aldershot Command]], [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]], [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]], [[Scottish Command]], [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] and [[Western Command (United Kingdom)|Western Command]]. In addition, there were functional commands, such as [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] (disbanded in the 1950s), and overseas commands, such as [[Middle East Command]]. Gradually, these were consolidated into a land command in the UK, Headquarters UK Land Forces, and a land command in Germany, [[British Army of the Rhine]]. Eventually, both were merged into [[Commander Land Forces|Land Command]] and later, Field Army.\n\nFrom 1995, UK commands and later districts were replaced by regenerative divisions. [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]], [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]] and [[London District (British Army)|London District]] acted as regional commands within the UK reporting to [[Commander Regional Forces (United Kingdom)|Commander Regional Forces]]. [[Scottish Command|Scotland District]] was absorbed by 2nd Division in 2000. The divisions were responsible for training subordinate formations and units under their command for operations in the UK, such as [[Military Aid to the Civil Community]], as well as training units for overseas deployments. 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions were replaced by [[Support Command (United Kingdom)|Support Command]] on 1 November 2011.<ref>Charles Heyman, 'The British Army: A Pocket Guide 2012-2013', p.31</ref> Support command was later re-titled as [[Regional Command (British Army)|Regional Command]] in 2015.\n\n[[London District]] includes many units with significant ceremonial roles. The [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]] is primarily mounted by the two [[Foot Guards]] Battalions and one Line Infantry Battalion, together with the [[British Army incremental infantry companies|Foot Guards Incremental companies]]: Nijmegen Company, [[Grenadier Guards]], No 7 Company, [[Coldstream Guards]], and F Company, [[Scots Guards]]. The guard at [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] is normally drawn from the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment]] (HCMR). The [[Honourable Artillery Company]] carries out public duties in the [[City of London]]. The HAC and the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]] provide gun salutes in London. Under the [[General Officer Commanding Scotland]], public duties in [[Edinburgh]] are the responsibility of a new incremental company, Balaklava Company, 5th Battalion, the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]), formed after the reduction of the Argylls from battalion status.\n\n===Corps===\n{{British Army lists}}\nA [[corps]], in the sense of a field fighting formation, is a formation of two or more divisions, potentially 50,000 personnel or more. While the British Army has no standing corps headquarters, forces are allocated through a number of multinational arrangements to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and European commitments, providing much of the headquarters capability and framework for the multinational [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]]. The last purely British corps, [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I (BR) Corps]], disbanded in Germany after the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe word corps is also used for administrative groupings by common function, such as the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]]. Various Combat Support Arms and Services are referred to in the wider sense as a Corps, such as the [[Royal Corps of Signals]].\n\n===Divisions===\nA [[Division (military)|division]] is a formation of three or four brigades, around twenty thousand personnel, commanded by a [[Major General]].\n\nThe British Army has two deployable divisions, capable of deploying the headquarters and subordinate formations immediately to operations. A third division has responsibility for overseeing both offensive and defensive [[cyberwarfare]], [[Military intelligence|intelligence activities]], [[surveillance]] and [[propaganda]].\n* [[1st (United Kingdom) Division]]\n* [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd (United Kingdom) Division]]\n* [[6th (United Kingdom) Division]]\n\n[[London District]] is responsible for the maintenance of capability for the defence of the capital and the provision of [[Public duties|ceremonial units]] and garrisons for the [[Crown Estate]] in London, such as the [[Tower of London]].\n\nSeveral [[British Army Infantry|infantry]] regiments are organised into four administrative divisions based on the type of infantry unit or traditional recruiting areas:\n* [[Guards Division]]\n* [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]]\n* [[King's Division]]\n* [[Queen's Division]]\n\n===Brigades===\nA [[brigade]] contains three or four battalion-sized units, around 5,000 personnel, and is commanded by a one star officer, a [[Brigadier]]. The brigade will contain a wide range of military disciplines allowing the conduct of a spectrum of military tasks.\n\nThe brigade would be required to deploy up to three separate [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]], the primary tactical formation employed in British doctrine. The battlegroup is a mixed formation built around the core of one unit, an armoured regiment or infantry battalion, with sub-units providing artillery, engineers, logistics, aviation, etc., as required.\n\nCombat formations include:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/formations-divisions-brigades/|title=Formations, Divisions & Brigades|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref>\n\n*[[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Infantry Brigade]]\n*[[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East]]\n*[[7th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters East]]\n*[[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East]]\n*[[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th Armoured Infantry Brigade]]\n*[[16 Air Assault Brigade|16th Air Assault Brigade]]\n*[[20th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th Armoured Infantry Brigade]]\n*[[51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland]]\n\nAn additional formation, [[3 Commando Brigade|3rd Commando Brigade]], is formed primarily of units of the [[Royal Marines]], a [[commando]] trained force that is part of the [[Her Majesty's Naval Service|Naval Service]], but has a number of British Army units under its command.\n\nThere are also several combat support and combat service support units of brigade size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* [[1st Artillery Brigade and Headquarters South West|1st Artillery Brigade]]\n* [[1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade]]\n* [[1st Military Police Brigade]]\n* [[1st Signal Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st (United Kingdom) Signal Brigade]]\n* [[2nd Medical Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Medical Brigade]]\n* [[8th Engineer Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Engineer Brigade]]\n* [[11th Signal Brigade and Headquarters West Midlands]]\n* [[77th Brigade (United Kingdom)|77th Brigade]]\n* [[101st Logistic Brigade]]\n* [[102nd Logistic Brigade (United Kingdom)|102nd Logistic Brigade]] \n* [[104th Logistic Support Brigade (United Kingdom)|104th Logistic Support Brigade]]\n* [[Specialised Infantry Group]]\n\nIn addition to the brigades above, there are a number of other units of brigade-size, some which are under joint command.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* [[Joint Helicopter Command]]\n* [[7 Air Defence Group|7th Air Defence Group]]\n* [[London District (British Army)|London District]]\n*[[Headquarters North West (United Kingdom)|Headquarters North West]] - Regional Point of Command\n*[[Headquarters South West (United Kingdom)|Headquarters South West]]- Regional Point of Command\n*[[38th (Irish) Brigade]] - Regional Point of Command\n*[[160th (Welsh) Brigade]] - Regional Point of Command\n\n==Order of precedence==\n{{See also| British Army Order of Precedence}}\n\nThe [[British Army]] parades according to the order of precedence, from right to left, with the unit at the extreme right being highest on the order. The Household Cavalry has the highest precedence, unless the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] parades with its guns.\n\n==Arms and services==\n\n===Combat Arms===\nThe Combat Arms are the \"teeth\" of the British Army, infantry, armoured and aviation units which engage in close action.\n\n====Household Cavalry and Royal Armoured Corps====\n{{main|Household Cavalry|Royal Armoured Corps}}\n\nRegiments of line [[cavalry]] and the [[Royal Tank Regiment]] together form the Royal Armoured Corps which has units equipped with either main battle tanks, light armour for [[formation reconnaissance regiment|reconnaissance]], or lightly armoured vehicles for the [[light cavalry]] role. An additional reconnaissance regiment is provided by the Household Cavalry Regiment, of the Household Cavalry, which administratively is not considered to be part of the RAC, but is included among the RAC order of battle for operational tasking.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n!Armoured Regiments||Armoured Cavalry Regiments||Light Cavalry Regiments\n|-\n|[[King's Royal Hussars|The King's Royal Hussars]]||[[Household Cavalry Regiment]]||[[1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards]]\n|-\n|[[Queen's Royal Hussars|The Queen's Royal Hussars<br>(Queen's Own and Royal Irish)]]||[[Royal Dragoon Guards|The Royal Dragoon Guards]]||[[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards|The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards<br>(Carabiniers and Greys)]]\n|-\n|[[Royal Tank Regiment|The Royal Tank Regiment]]||[[Royal Lancers|The Royal Lancers<br>(Queen Elizabeths' Own)]]||[[Light Dragoons|The Light Dragoons]]\n|}\n\n====Infantry====\n{{main| Infantry of the British Army}}\nThe Infantry is divided for administrative purposes into four 'divisions', with battalions being trained and equipped to operate in one of six main roles:\n* [[Air assault|Air Assault Infantry]]\n* [[Armoured infantry|Armoured Infantry]]\n* [[Light Infantry]]\n* [[Mechanized infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]\n* [[Specialised Infantry|Specialised Training Infantry]]\n* [[Public duties|Public Duties]]\n\nUnder the arms-plot system, a battalion would spend between two and six years in one role, before re-training for another. Following a review of the operation of the army, it has been demonstrated that this system is inefficient and it is being phased out, with battalions specialising in role\u2014this will see armoured infantry, mechanised infantry and air assault battalions remaining in a single posting; however, light infantry battalions will continue to be periodically rotated between postings.

Personnel from the AGC administrative and educational specialisations serve in attached posts to establishments or units of other arms. The police and disciplinary activities retain their own cap badges and act as discrete bodies. The Corps as a whole is divided into four separate branches:\n* '''Staff and Personnel Branch''': The SPS branch is the largest part of the AGC and has responsibility for providing most administrative functions, including finance, IT support, human resources. The SPS branch was formed by the amalgamation of the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]] with elements of the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] and [[Women's Royal Army Corps]].\n* '''Education and Training Services Branch''': The [[Educational and Training Services Branch|ETS]] branch provides for the educational needs of all serving personnel. These cover both professional development within the army, and wider personal development. The ETS branch was formed through the renaming of the [[Royal Army Educational Corps]].\n* '''Army Legal Services Branch''': The [[Army Legal Services Branch|ALS branch]] provides legal advice to the army and to individuals requiring representation at Courts Martial. It is one of the smallest individual units, numbering 120 professionally qualified lawyers. All of its members are officers. The ALS branch retains the cap badge and traditions of the Army Legal Corps.\n* '''Provost Branch''': The Provost branch consists of three separate elements:\n** '''Military Provost Staff''': The [[Military Provost Staff Corps|MPS]] is the element of the provost branch responsible for administering military correctional facilities. The MPS is one of the few elements in the army that does not recruit directly; instead, its members are volunteers from other branches of the army. The MPS retains the cap badge and traditions of the Military Provost Staff Corps.\n** '''Royal Military Police''': The [[Royal Military Police|RMP]] provides the army's policing services, both in peacetime and in wartime. Units of the RMP are trained to deploy with the Field Army in the event of mobilisation. The RMP provides two regular regiments and supplements Army Reserve regiments with one Provost company each. A further provost company is trained in the air assault mission and is permanently attached to 16 Air Assault Brigade. The Corps also provides a number of specialist capabilities, such as the Special Investigation Branch, Close Protection Teams and special escort capabilities.\n*** 1 Regiment, Royal Military Police\n*** 3 Regiment, Royal Military Police\n** '''Military Provost Guard Service''': The [[Military Provost Guard Service|MPGS]] is a unit dedicated to the guarding of military installations, allowing the army to replace civilian guards with trained soldiers.

Here candidates learn the basic standards of military performance including operation in the field, weapon handling, personal administration, drill etc.\n* Prospective officers attend the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], where they undergo basic training in soldiering, defence policy and the structure of government, administration, command and leadership. The Commissioning Course for new entry officers lasts 44 weeks. Some specialist branches, Medical and Legal, undergo a short course which provides basic military training.\n* Infantry soldiers undergo a 26-week course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]] at [[Catterick Garrison]] which combines phase one and phase two training.\n* Soldiers in other specialisations undergo the 14-week Army Development Course at the [[Army Training Centre, Pirbright]] or the [[Army Training Regiment]] at [[Winchester]]\n* Junior Soldiers (Under 18) at the [[Army Foundation College]] in [[Harrogate]] undergo either 23 or 46 weeks training (Junior Soldiers with trades complete 23 weeks and infantry Junior Soldiers complete 46 weeks)\nPhase two training is specific to the trade that the soldier or officer will follow and is conducted in a branch specialised school. Phase two training enables the individual to join an operational unit prepared to contribute to operational effectiveness. These schools are under the direction of the parent corps or arm of the service, as illustrated above, with the Infantry Training Centre being formed of two training battalions.\n\n==Units of the Army Reserve==\n{{main|Army Reserve (United Kingdom)}}\n\n===Combat Arms===\n\n====Armour====\nThe four armoured regiments of the Army Reserve operate in two roles -

This is broadly similar to the structures of the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]], in that the four-star (general-equivalent) [[commanders-in-chief]] have been eliminated since 2011 and service chiefs are given direct command of their respective services are responsible as Top Level Budget (TLB) holders.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27408/defence_reform_report_struct_mgt_mod_27june2011.pdf |title=Defence Reform: an independent report into the structure and management of the Ministry of Defence (June 2011) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1 June 2011 |website=gov.uk |publisher=Ministry of Defence |access-date=21 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> [[Army Headquarters (United Kingdom)|Army Headquarters]] is located in Andover, Hampshire. There is a [[Commander Field Army]] and a personnel and UK operations command, [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]].\n\nThe command structure is hierarchical with [[division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s controlling groupings of units from an administrative perspective. Major Units are [[regiment]] or [[battalion]]-sized with minor units being either [[Company (military unit)|company]] sized sub-units or [[platoon]]s. All units within the service are either Regular (full-time) or [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (full-time or part-time), or a combination with sub-units of each type.\n\nNaming conventions of units differ for traditional British historical reasons, creating a significant opportunity for confusion; an [[infantry]] battalion is equivalent to a [[cavalry]] regiment. An infantry regiment is an administrative and ceremonial organisation only, and may include several battalions. For operational tasks, a [[battlegroup (army)|battle group]] will be formed around a combat unit, supported by units or sub-units from other areas. An example would be a squadron of tanks attached to an armoured infantry battle group, together with a reconnaissance troop, artillery battery and engineering support.\n\nSince the 1957 Defence Review, the size of the Army has consistently shrunk. A comparison of the [[List of British Army Regiments (1962)]], the [[List of British Army Regiments (1994)]] and the [[List of British Army Regiments (2008)]] will show the steep decline in the number of infantry and armoured regiments. Since 1990, reductions have been almost constant, through succeeding defence reviews: [[Options for Change]] (1990), [[Front Line First]] (1994), the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, [[Delivering Security in a Changing World]] (2003), and the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]] of 2010. However, the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|2015 Review]] indicated no change from the personnel number targets set in 2010.\n\n==Army Headquarters==\nThrough a major army reorganisation effective 1 November 2011, the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] took direct command of the Army through a new structure, based at [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]<ref>[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/92060/response/228969/attach/3/20111121%20FOI%20Cross%20Response%20V2%20U.pdf Correspondence from Army Secretariat]</ref> and known as \"[[Army Headquarters (United Kingdom)|Army Headquarters]]\".<ref name=intel>[http://www.dmilt.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2506:uk-army-command-reorganization&catid=1:europe&Itemid=57 Army Command reorganization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112055548/http://www.dmilt.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2506%3Auk-army-command-reorganization&catid=1%3Aeurope&Itemid=57 |date=2011-11-12 }} Defence Marketing Intelligence, 10 November 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/142.aspx Higher Command] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605053921/http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/142.aspx |date=2013-06-05 }}</ref>\n\nReporting to the Chief of the General Staff are four [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]]s: the [[Deputy Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]]; the [[Commander Field Army]] (CFA); the Commander [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]] (CHC), and Commander [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]]. The CFA is responsible for generating and preparing forces for current and contingency operations; he commands [[1st (United Kingdom) Division]], [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd (United Kingdom) Division]], [[6th (United Kingdom) Division]] and [[Joint Helicopter Command]] (JHC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/media/2400/armystructure_landscape_v4-01.png|title=Army Structure|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\nCHC is responsible for commanding a wide variety or organisations that both contribute to the administrative running of the Army (i.e. the Army Personnel Centre (APC) in Glasgow), and focuses on the 'home base' (i.e. [[Regional Command (British Army)|Regional Command]]).\n\n==Formations==\n\n===Commands===\nA [[Command (military formation)|command]] is a military formation that handles a specific task or region, and can direct forces as large as multiple corps or as little as a few battalions. Previously the Army had regional commands in the UK, including [[Aldershot Command]], [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]], [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]], [[Scottish Command]], [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] and [[Western Command (United Kingdom)|Western Command]]. In addition, there were functional commands, such as [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] (disbanded in the 1950s), and overseas commands, such as [[Middle East Command]]. Gradually, these were consolidated into a land command in the UK, Headquarters UK Land Forces, and a land command in Germany, [[British Army of the Rhine]]. Eventually, both were merged into [[Commander Land Forces|Land Command]] and later, Field Army.\n\nFrom 1995, UK commands and later districts were replaced by regenerative divisions. [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]], [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]], [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]] and [[London District (British Army)|London District]] acted as regional commands within the UK reporting to [[Commander Regional Forces (United Kingdom)|Commander Regional Forces]]. [[Scottish Command|Scotland District]] was absorbed by 2nd Division in 2000. The divisions were responsible for training subordinate formations and units under their command for operations in the UK, such as [[Military Aid to the Civil Community]], as well as training units for overseas deployments. 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions were replaced by [[Support Command (United Kingdom)|Support Command]] on 1 November 2011.<ref>Charles Heyman, 'The British Army: A Pocket Guide 2012-2013', p.31</ref> Support command was later re-titled as [[Regional Command (British Army)|Regional Command]] in 2015.\n\n[[London District]] includes many units with significant ceremonial roles. The [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]] is primarily mounted by the two [[Foot Guards]] Battalions and one Line Infantry Battalion, together with the [[British Army incremental infantry companies|Foot Guards Incremental companies]]: Nijmegen Company, [[Grenadier Guards]], No 7 Company, [[Coldstream Guards]], and F Company, [[Scots Guards]]. The guard at [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] is normally drawn from the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment]] (HCMR). The [[Honourable Artillery Company]] carries out public duties in the [[City of London]]. The HAC and the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]] provide gun salutes in London. Under the [[General Officer Commanding Scotland]], public duties in [[Edinburgh]] are the responsibility of a new incremental company, Balaklava Company, 5th Battalion, the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]), formed after the reduction of the Argylls from battalion status.\n\n===Corps===\n{{British Army lists}}\nA [[corps]], in the sense of a field fighting formation, is a formation of two or more divisions, potentially 50,000 personnel or more. While the British Army has no standing corps headquarters, forces are allocated through a number of multinational arrangements to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and European commitments, providing much of the headquarters capability and framework for the multinational [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]]. The last purely British corps, [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I (BR) Corps]], disbanded in Germany after the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe word corps is also used for administrative groupings by common function, such as the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]]. Various Combat Support Arms and Services are referred to in the wider sense as a Corps, such as the [[Royal Corps of Signals]].\n\n===Divisions===\nA [[Division (military)|division]] is a formation of three or four brigades, around twenty thousand personnel, commanded by a [[Major General]].\n\nThe British Army has two deployable divisions, capable of deploying the headquarters and subordinate formations immediately to operations. A third division has responsibility for overseeing both offensive and defensive [[cyberwarfare]], [[Military intelligence|intelligence activities]], [[surveillance]] and [[propaganda]].\n* [[1st (United Kingdom) Division]]\n* [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd (United Kingdom) Division]]\n* [[6th (United Kingdom) Division]]\n\n[[London District]] is responsible for the maintenance of capability for the defence of the capital and the provision of [[Public duties|ceremonial units]] and garrisons for the [[Crown Estate]] in London, such as the [[Tower of London]].\n\nSeveral [[British Army Infantry|infantry]] regiments are organised into four administrative divisions based on the type of infantry unit or traditional recruiting areas:\n* [[Guards Division]]\n* [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]]\n* [[King's Division]]\n* [[Queen's Division]]\n\n===Brigades===\nA [[brigade]] contains three or four battalion-sized units, around 5,000 personnel, and is commanded by a one star officer, a [[Brigadier]]. The brigade will contain a wide range of military disciplines allowing the conduct of a spectrum of military tasks.\n\nThe brigade would be required to deploy up to three separate [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroups]], the primary tactical formation employed in British doctrine. The battlegroup is a mixed formation built around the core of one unit, an armoured regiment or infantry battalion, with sub-units providing artillery, engineers, logistics, aviation, etc., as required.\n\nCombat formations include:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/formations-divisions-brigades/|title=Formations, Divisions & Brigades|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref>\n\n*[[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Infantry Brigade]]\n*[[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East]]\n*[[7th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters East]]\n*[[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East]]\n*[[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th Armoured Infantry Brigade]]\n*[[16 Air Assault Brigade|16th Air Assault Brigade]]\n*[[20th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th Armoured Infantry Brigade]]\n*[[51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland]]\n\nAn additional formation, [[3 Commando Brigade|3rd Commando Brigade]], is formed primarily of units of the [[Royal Marines]], a [[commando]] trained force that is part of the [[Her Majesty's Naval Service|Naval Service]], but has a number of British Army units under its command.\n\nThere are also several combat support and combat service support units of brigade size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* [[1st Artillery Brigade and Headquarters South West|1st Artillery Brigade]]\n* [[1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade]]\n* [[1st Military Police Brigade]]\n* [[1st Signal Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st (United Kingdom) Signal Brigade]]\n* [[2nd Medical Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Medical Brigade]]\n* [[8th Engineer Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Engineer Brigade]]\n* [[11th Signal Brigade and Headquarters West Midlands]]\n* [[77th Brigade (United Kingdom)|77th Brigade]]\n* [[101st Logistic Brigade]]\n* [[102nd Logistic Brigade (United Kingdom)|102nd Logistic Brigade]] \n* [[104th Logistic Support Brigade (United Kingdom)|104th Logistic Support Brigade]]\n* [[Specialised Infantry Group]]\n\nIn addition to the brigades above, there are a number of other units of brigade-size, some which are under joint command.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* [[Joint Helicopter Command]]\n* [[7 Air Defence Group|7th Air Defence Group]]\n* [[London District (British Army)|London District]]\n*[[Headquarters North West (United Kingdom)|Headquarters North West]] - Regional Point of Command\n*[[Headquarters South West (United Kingdom)|Headquarters South West]]- Regional Point of Command\n*[[38th (Irish) Brigade]] - Regional Point of Command\n*[[160th (Welsh) Brigade]] - Regional Point of Command\n\n==Order of precedence==\n{{See also| British Army Order of Precedence}}\n\nThe [[British Army]] parades according to the order of precedence, from right to left, with the unit at the extreme right being highest on the order.

An additional reconnaissance regiment is provided by the Household Cavalry Regiment, of the Household Cavalry, which administratively is not considered to be part of the RAC, but is included among the RAC order of battle for operational tasking.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n!Armoured Regiments||Armoured Cavalry Regiments||Light Cavalry Regiments\n|-\n|[[King's Royal Hussars|The King's Royal Hussars]]||[[Household Cavalry Regiment]]||[[1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards]]\n|-\n|[[Queen's Royal Hussars|The Queen's Royal Hussars<br>(Queen's Own and Royal Irish)]]||[[Royal Dragoon Guards|The Royal Dragoon Guards]]||[[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards|The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards<br>(Carabiniers and Greys)]]\n|-\n|[[Royal Tank Regiment|The Royal Tank Regiment]]||[[Royal Lancers|The Royal Lancers<br>(Queen Elizabeths' Own)]]||[[Light Dragoons|The Light Dragoons]]\n|}\n\n====Infantry====\n{{main| Infantry of the British Army}}\nThe Infantry is divided for administrative purposes into four 'divisions', with battalions being trained and equipped to operate in one of six main roles:\n* [[Air assault|Air Assault Infantry]]\n* [[Armoured infantry|Armoured Infantry]]\n* [[Light Infantry]]\n* [[Mechanized infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]\n* [[Specialised Infantry|Specialised Training Infantry]]\n* [[Public duties|Public Duties]]\n\nUnder the arms-plot system, a battalion would spend between two and six years in one role, before re-training for another. Following a review of the operation of the army, it has been demonstrated that this system is inefficient and it is being phased out, with battalions specialising in role\u2014this will see armoured infantry, mechanised infantry and air assault battalions remaining in a single posting; however, light infantry battalions will continue to be periodically rotated between postings.

Within the deployable brigades, the Signal Regiment also provides support to the HQ function including logistics, life support and force protection capabilities.\n*[[1 Signal Regiment (United Kingdom)|1st Signal Regiment]]\n*[[2 Signal Regiment (United Kingdom)|2nd Signal Regiment]]\n*[[3 Signal Regiment (United Kingdom)|3rd Signal Regiment]]\n*[[10 Signal Regiment (United Kingdom)|10th Signal Regiment]]\n*[[Royal School of Signals|11th (Royal School of Signals) Signal Regiment]]\n*[[14 Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare)|14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare)]]\n*[[15 Signal Regiment (Information Support)|15th Signal Regiment (Information Support)]]\n*16th Signal Regiment\n*[[18 (UKSF) Signal Regiment|18th (UKSF) Signal Regiment]]\n*[[21 Signal Regiment (United Kingdom)|21st Signal Regiment]]\n*22nd Signal Regiment\n*30th Signal Regiment\n\n====Army Air Corps====\nThe [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] provides battlefield air support with six regiments and four independent squadrons and flights:\n*[[1 Regiment Army Air Corps]]\n*[[2 (Training) Regiment Army Air Corps]]\n*[[3 Regiment Army Air Corps]]\n*[[4 Regiment Army Air Corps]]\n*[[5 Regiment Army Air Corps]]\n*[[7 (Training) Regiment Army Air Corps]]\n*[[No. 657 Squadron AAC|657 Squadron]] ([[RAF Odiham]]) \n*[[No. 658 Squadron AAC|658 Squadron]] ([[Stirling Lines]])\n*[[No. 7 Flight AAC|7 Flight]] ([[Brunei]])\n*[[No. 25 Flight AAC|25 Flight]] ([[AAC Middle Wallop]])\n\n====Intelligence Corps====\nThe [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] provides intelligence support including collection, interpretation and counter-intelligence capabilities with three battalions and a joint service group:\n* 1 Military Intelligence Battalion\n* 2 Military Intelligence Battalion\n* 4 Military Intelligence Battalion\n* [[15 Psychological Operations Group|15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group]]\n\n===Combat Service Support Arms===\nThe Combat Service Support Arms provide sustainment and support for the Combat and Combat Support Arms. Whilst CSS personnel are not intended to close with and engage opposition forces, the fluidity of the modern battlefield means that these personnel are likely to be engaged in close combat at times, particularly when associated with Battle Groups.\n\n====Royal Logistic Corps====\nThe [[Royal Logistic Corps]] is the largest single corps in the British Army:\n*[[1 Regiment RLC|1 Close Support Logistic Regiment RLC]]\n*[[3 Regiment RLC|3 Close Support Logistic Regiment RLC]]\n*[[4 Regiment RLC|4 Close Support Logistic Regiment RLC]]\n*6 Force Logistic Regiment RLC\n*7 Force Logistic Regiment RLC\n*[[9 Regiment RLC|9 Theatre Logistic Regiment RLC]]\n*[[10 Queen's Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment RLC]]\n*[[11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Regiment RLC]]\n*[[13 Air Assault Regiment RLC|13 Air Assault Support Regiment RLC]]\n*[[17 Port and Maritime Regiment RLC]]\n*25 Training Support Regiment RLC\n*27 Theatre Logistic Regiment RLC\n*29 Postal Courier & Movement Regiment RLC\n\n====Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers====\nThe [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] is a corps that provides maintenance support to equipment and vehicles. Most units will have either a Light Aid Detachment (LAD) or Workshop (Wksp) attached. Seven battalions provide support to formations of brigade level and above:\n*1 Close Support Battalion REME\n*2 Close Support Battalion REME\n*3 Close Support Battalion REME\n*4 Close Support Battalion REME\n*5 Force Support Battalion REME\n*6 Close Support Battalion REME\n*7 Aviation Support Battalion REME\n\n====Medical services====\nThe [[Army Medical Services]] provide primary and secondary care for the armed forces in fixed locations and whilst deployed on operations. Personnel are attached to a parent unit, one of five field regiments or the defence medical services. The AMS comprises four different Corps providing the range of medical and veterinary care, with the Royal Army Medical Corps also providing the administrative framework for the regiments.\n* [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]\n**[[1st Armoured Medical Regiment]]\n**[[2nd Medical Regiment]]\n**[[3 Medical Regiment (United Kingdom)|3 Medical Regiment]]\n**4 Armoured Medical Regiment\n**5 Armoured Medical Regiment\n**16 Medical Regiment\n**225 Medical Regiment\n**253 Medical Regiment\n** 22 Field Hospital\n** 33 Field Hospital\n** 34 Field Hospital\n**[[254th Medical Regiment|254 Medical Regiment]]\n* [[Royal Army Dental Corps]]\n* [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]]\n* [[Royal Army Veterinary Corps]]\n** [[1st Military Working Dog Regiment|1 Military Working Dog Regiment]]\n\n====Adjutant General's Corps====\nThe [[Adjutant General's Corps]] provides administrative, police and disciplinary and educational support to the army. The AGC is an amalgamation with three of the constituent units retaining their previous cap badge. Personnel from the AGC administrative and educational specialisations serve in attached posts to establishments or units of other arms. The police and disciplinary activities retain their own cap badges and act as discrete bodies. The Corps as a whole is divided into four separate branches:\n* '''Staff and Personnel Branch''': The SPS branch is the largest part of the AGC and has responsibility for providing most administrative functions, including finance, IT support, human resources. The SPS branch was formed by the amalgamation of the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]] with elements of the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] and [[Women's Royal Army Corps]].\n* '''Education and Training Services Branch''': The [[Educational and Training Services Branch|ETS]] branch provides for the educational needs of all serving personnel. These cover both professional development within the army, and wider personal development. The ETS branch was formed through the renaming of the [[Royal Army Educational Corps]].\n* '''Army Legal Services Branch''': The [[Army Legal Services Branch|ALS branch]] provides legal advice to the army and to individuals requiring representation at Courts Martial. It is one of the smallest individual units, numbering 120 professionally qualified lawyers. All of its members are officers. The ALS branch retains the cap badge and traditions of the Army Legal Corps.\n* '''Provost Branch''': The Provost branch consists of three separate elements:\n** '''Military Provost Staff''': The [[Military Provost Staff Corps|MPS]] is the element of the provost branch responsible for administering military correctional facilities. The MPS is one of the few elements in the army that does not recruit directly; instead, its members are volunteers from other branches of the army. The MPS retains the cap badge and traditions of the Military Provost Staff Corps.\n** '''Royal Military Police''': The [[Royal Military Police|RMP]] provides the army's policing services, both in peacetime and in wartime. Units of the RMP are trained to deploy with the Field Army in the event of mobilisation. The RMP provides two regular regiments and supplements Army Reserve regiments with one Provost company each. A further provost company is trained in the air assault mission and is permanently attached to 16 Air Assault Brigade. The Corps also provides a number of specialist capabilities, such as the Special Investigation Branch, Close Protection Teams and special escort capabilities.\n*** 1 Regiment, Royal Military Police\n*** 3 Regiment, Royal Military Police\n** '''Military Provost Guard Service''': The [[Military Provost Guard Service|MPGS]] is a unit dedicated to the guarding of military installations, allowing the army to replace civilian guards with trained soldiers. The [[MPGS]] has responsibilities at installations belonging to all three services.\n\n====Other services====\n* [[Royal Army Physical Training Corps]]\n* [[Corps of Army Music]]\n* [[Royal Army Chaplains' Department]]\n* [[Small Arms School Corps]]\n\n==Training==\n{{main|Selection and Training in the British Army}}\n\nTraining in the Regular Army differs for soldiers and officers but in general takes place in at least two phases:\n\nPhase one training is basic military training for all new recruits. Here candidates learn the basic standards of military performance including operation in the field, weapon handling, personal administration, drill etc.\n* Prospective officers attend the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], where they undergo basic training in soldiering, defence policy and the structure of government, administration, command and leadership. The Commissioning Course for new entry officers lasts 44 weeks. Some specialist branches, Medical and Legal, undergo a short course which provides basic military training.\n* Infantry soldiers undergo a 26-week course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]] at [[Catterick Garrison]] which combines phase one and phase two training.\n* Soldiers in other specialisations undergo the 14-week Army Development Course at the [[Army Training Centre, Pirbright]] or the [[Army Training Regiment]] at [[Winchester]]\n* Junior Soldiers (Under 18) at the [[Army Foundation College]] in [[Harrogate]] undergo either 23 or 46 weeks training (Junior Soldiers with trades complete 23 weeks and infantry Junior Soldiers complete 46 weeks)\nPhase two training is specific to the trade that the soldier or officer will follow and is conducted in a branch specialised school. Phase two training enables the individual to join an operational unit prepared to contribute to operational effectiveness. These schools are under the direction of the parent corps or arm of the service, as illustrated above, with the Infantry Training Centre being formed of two training battalions.\n\n==Units of the Army Reserve==\n{{main|Army Reserve (United Kingdom)}}\n\n===Combat Arms===\n\n====Armour====\nThe four armoured regiments of the Army Reserve operate in two roles - provision of crew replacements for armoured regiments, and Light Cavalry (reconnaissance):\n* [[Royal Yeomanry]]\n* [[Royal Wessex Yeomanry]]\n* [[Queen's Own Yeomanry]]\n* [[Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry]]\n\n====Infantry====\n* [[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion The [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n* [[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion The [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n* 3rd Battalion, The [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]]\n* 4th Battalion, The [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]]\n* The [[London Regiment]]\n* 4th Battalion, The [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment]]\n* 5th Battalion, The [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n* 3rd Battalion, The [[Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n* 4th Battalion, The [[Yorkshire Regiment]]\n* 4th Battalion, The [[Mercian Regiment]]\n* 3rd Battalion, The [[Royal Welsh]]\n* 2nd Battalion, The [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]]\n* [[4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment|4th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment]]\n* 6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n* 7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n====Special Air Service====\n* [[Artists Rifles|21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists)]]\n* [[23 Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve)|23rd Special Air Service Regiment]]\n\n===Combat Support===\n\n====Honourable Artillery Company====\n\n* [[Honourable Artillery Company]]\n\n==== Royal Artillery ====\n\n* [[101st (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery|101 (Northumbrian) Regiment RA]] -
