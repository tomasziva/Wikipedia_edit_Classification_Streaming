Despite the performances of the cast (particularly Bale, Adams and Rockwell) receiving universal acclaim, the film polarized critics; some considered it to be one of the best films of the year while others thought it to be one of the worst, with McKay's screenplay and direction receiving both \"scathing critiques and celebratory praise\". <ref>{{cite web|first=Nate|last=Nickolai|date=December 17, 2018|title=\u2018Vice\u2019 Reviews: What the Critics Are Saying|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/vice-reviews-critics-christian-bale-adam-mckay-1203091272|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=New York City|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Alison|last=Foreman|date=December 17, 2018|title=\u2018VICE' divides critics in early reviews|url=https://mashable.com/article/vice-review-roundup-christian-bale-dick-cheney/#FywJb4QPPOqR|work=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film received [[List of accolades received by Vice (2018 film)|numerous awards and nominations]], with eight nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], including a [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nomination and a win for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Make-Up and Hairstyling]]. It also had a leading six nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] (including a nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]), and six nominations at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]]. For their performances, Bale, Adams, and Rockwell were nominated at all three shows, with Bale winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Vice'' is narrated by Kurt, a fictitious veteran of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]]s. The film opens with [[Dick Cheney]] and other [[White House]] officials and staff responding to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]]. The film then flashes back to [[Wyoming]] in 1963, where Cheney finds work as a [[lineworker|lineman]] after his alcoholism led him to drop out of [[Yale University]]. After Cheney is stopped by a traffic cop for [[Driving under the influence|driving while intoxicated]], his wife [[Lynne Cheney]] convinces him to clean up his life.\n\nThe film flashes forward to 1969 when Cheney finds work as a White House intern during the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]]. Working under Nixon's economic adviser, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], Cheney becomes a savvy political operative as he juggles commitments to his wife and their daughters, [[Liz Cheney|Liz]] and [[Mary Cheney|Mary]]. Cheney overhears [[Henry Kissinger]] discussing the secret [[Operation Menu|bombing of Cambodia]] with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], revealing the true power of the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] to Cheney. Rumsfeld's abrasive attitude leads to him and Cheney being distanced from Nixon, which works in both men's favor; after [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|Nixon's resignation]], Cheney rises to the position of [[White House Chief of Staff]] for President [[Gerald Ford]] while Rumsfeld becomes [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. The media later dubs the sudden shake-up in the [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] as the [[Halloween Massacre]]. During his tenure, a young [[Antonin Scalia]] introduces Cheney to the [[unitary executive theory]].\n\nAfter [[1976 United States presidential election|Ford is voted out of office]], Cheney runs to be [[1978 United States House of Representatives election in Wyoming|representative for Wyoming]]. After giving an awkward and uncharismatic campaign speech, Cheney suffers his first [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. While he recovers, Lynne campaigns on her husband's behalf, helping him to win a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]], Cheney supported a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favoring the [[fossil fuel]] industries. He also supported the abolishment of the [[FCC fairness doctrine]] which led to the rise of [[Fox News]], [[conservative talk radio]], and the rising level of [[Political polarization|party polarization]] in the United States. Cheney next serves as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] under President [[George H. W. Bush]] during the [[Gulf War]]. Outside of politics, Cheney and Lynne come to terms with their younger daughter, Mary, [[coming out]] as [[lesbian]]. Though Cheney develops ambitions to run for president, he decides to retire from public life to spare Mary from media scrutiny.\n\nDuring the [[presidency of Bill Clinton]], Cheney becomes the CEO of [[Halliburton]] while his wife raises [[Golden Retriever|golden retrievers]] and [[Lynne Cheney#Books|writes books]]. A false epilogue claims that Cheney lived the rest of his life healthy and happy in the private sector and credits begin rolling, only for them to abruptly end as the film continues.\n\nCheney is invited to become running mate to [[George W. Bush]] during the [[2000 United States presidential election]]. Cheney seems to feel that the younger Bush is more interested in pleasing his father than attaining power for himself, Cheney agrees on the condition that Bush delegates \"mundane\" executive responsibilities, such as [[Energy policy of the United States|energy]], the [[United States Armed Forces|military]], and [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]], to him. As [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], Cheney works with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, legal counsel [[David Addington]], [[Mary Matalin]], and the [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|Chief of Staff]], [[Scooter Libby]], to exercise control of key [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign policy]] and defense decisions throughout Washington.\n\nThe film returns to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as Cheney and Rumsfeld maneuver to initiate and then preside over the U.S. invasions [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]], resulting in the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the torture of prisoners. As the [[War on terror|War on Terror]] mounts, Cheney continues to struggle with persistent heart attacks. The film also covers various events from his vice presidency, including his endorsement of the unitary executive theory, the [[Plame affair]], the [[Dick Cheney hunting accident|accidental shooting]] of [[Harry Whittington]], and tensions between the Cheney sisters over [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. Cheney's actions are shown to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq]], resulting in him receiving record-low [[United States presidential approval rating|approval ratings]] by the end of the Bush administration.\n\nWhile narrating Cheney's tearful deathbed goodbye to his family after another hospitalization, Kurt is killed in a motor accident while jogging. In March 2012, his healthy heart is [[Heart transplantation|transplanted]] into Cheney. A few months later, Cheney acquiesces to his daughter Liz's saying she is opposed to same-sex marriage when she runs for a [[2014 United States Senate election in Wyoming|Senate seat in Wyoming]], leaving Mary angry and upset. Liz later [[2016 United States House of Representatives election in Wyoming|wins the election]] to her father's former Congressional position. At the end of the film, an irate Cheney breaks the [[fourth wall]] and delivers a monologue to the audience, stating that he has no regrets about anything he has done in his career.\n\nA [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] depicts a focus group descending into chaos when a conservative panelist slams the film itself as biased and attacks a liberal panelist who defends the movie and insults him, while another younger panelist expresses her anticipation for the next ''[[Fast & Furious|The Fast and the Furious]]'' movie.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main characters===\n{{cast list|\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Dick Cheney]]\n** Alex MacNicoll and Aidan Gail as young Dick Cheney\n* [[Amy Adams]] as [[Lynne Cheney|Lynne Vincent Cheney]]\n** [[Cailee Spaeny]] as young Lynne\n* [[Steve Carell]] as [[Donald Rumsfeld]]\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[George W.

It also had a leading six nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] (including a nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]), and six nominations at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]]. For their performances, Bale, Adams, and Rockwell were nominated at all three shows, with Bale winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Vice'' is narrated by Kurt, a fictitious veteran of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]]s. The film opens with [[Dick Cheney]] and other [[White House]] officials and staff responding to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]]. The film then flashes back to [[Wyoming]] in 1963, where Cheney finds work as a [[lineworker|lineman]] after his alcoholism led him to drop out of [[Yale University]]. After Cheney is stopped by a traffic cop for [[Driving under the influence|driving while intoxicated]], his wife [[Lynne Cheney]] convinces him to clean up his life.\n\nThe film flashes forward to 1969 when Cheney finds work as a White House intern during the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]]. Working under Nixon's economic adviser, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], Cheney becomes a savvy political operative as he juggles commitments to his wife and their daughters, [[Liz Cheney|Liz]] and [[Mary Cheney|Mary]]. Cheney overhears [[Henry Kissinger]] discussing the secret [[Operation Menu|bombing of Cambodia]] with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], revealing the true power of the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] to Cheney. Rumsfeld's abrasive attitude leads to him and Cheney being distanced from Nixon, which works in both men's favor; after [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|Nixon's resignation]], Cheney rises to the position of [[White House Chief of Staff]] for President [[Gerald Ford]] while Rumsfeld becomes [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. The media later dubs the sudden shake-up in the [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] as the [[Halloween Massacre]]. During his tenure, a young [[Antonin Scalia]] introduces Cheney to the [[unitary executive theory]].\n\nAfter [[1976 United States presidential election|Ford is voted out of office]], Cheney runs to be [[1978 United States House of Representatives election in Wyoming|representative for Wyoming]]. After giving an awkward and uncharismatic campaign speech, Cheney suffers his first [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. While he recovers, Lynne campaigns on her husband's behalf, helping him to win a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]], Cheney supported a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favoring the [[fossil fuel]] industries. He also supported the abolishment of the [[FCC fairness doctrine]] which led to the rise of [[Fox News]], [[conservative talk radio]], and the rising level of [[Political polarization|party polarization]] in the United States. Cheney next serves as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] under President [[George H. W. Bush]] during the [[Gulf War]]. Outside of politics, Cheney and Lynne come to terms with their younger daughter, Mary, [[coming out]] as [[lesbian]]. Though Cheney develops ambitions to run for president, he decides to retire from public life to spare Mary from media scrutiny.\n\nDuring the [[presidency of Bill Clinton]], Cheney becomes the CEO of [[Halliburton]] while his wife raises [[Golden Retriever|golden retrievers]] and [[Lynne Cheney#Books|writes books]]. A false epilogue claims that Cheney lived the rest of his life healthy and happy in the private sector and credits begin rolling, only for them to abruptly end as the film continues.\n\nCheney is invited to become running mate to [[George W. Bush]] during the [[2000 United States presidential election]]. Cheney seems to feel that the younger Bush is more interested in pleasing his father than attaining power for himself, Cheney agrees on the condition that Bush delegates \"mundane\" executive responsibilities, such as [[Energy policy of the United States|energy]], the [[United States Armed Forces|military]], and [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]], to him. As [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], Cheney works with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, legal counsel [[David Addington]], [[Mary Matalin]], and the [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|Chief of Staff]], [[Scooter Libby]], to exercise control of key [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign policy]] and defense decisions throughout Washington.\n\nThe film returns to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as Cheney and Rumsfeld maneuver to initiate and then preside over the U.S. invasions [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]], resulting in the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the torture of prisoners. As the [[War on terror|War on Terror]] mounts, Cheney continues to struggle with persistent heart attacks. The film also covers various events from his vice presidency, including his endorsement of the unitary executive theory, the [[Plame affair]], the [[Dick Cheney hunting accident|accidental shooting]] of [[Harry Whittington]], and tensions between the Cheney sisters over [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. Cheney's actions are shown to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq]], resulting in him receiving record-low [[United States presidential approval rating|approval ratings]] by the end of the Bush administration.\n\nWhile narrating Cheney's tearful deathbed goodbye to his family after another hospitalization, Kurt is killed in a motor accident while jogging. In March 2012, his healthy heart is [[Heart transplantation|transplanted]] into Cheney. A few months later, Cheney acquiesces to his daughter Liz's saying she is opposed to same-sex marriage when she runs for a [[2014 United States Senate election in Wyoming|Senate seat in Wyoming]], leaving Mary angry and upset. Liz later [[2016 United States House of Representatives election in Wyoming|wins the election]] to her father's former Congressional position. At the end of the film, an irate Cheney breaks the [[fourth wall]] and delivers a monologue to the audience, stating that he has no regrets about anything he has done in his career.\n\nA [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] depicts a focus group descending into chaos when a conservative panelist slams the film itself as biased and attacks a liberal panelist who defends the movie and insults him, while another younger panelist expresses her anticipation for the next ''[[Fast & Furious|The Fast and the Furious]]'' movie.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main characters===\n{{cast list|\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Dick Cheney]]\n** Alex MacNicoll and Aidan Gail as young Dick Cheney\n* [[Amy Adams]] as [[Lynne Cheney|Lynne Vincent Cheney]]\n** [[Cailee Spaeny]] as young Lynne\n* [[Steve Carell]] as [[Donald Rumsfeld]]\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[George W.
