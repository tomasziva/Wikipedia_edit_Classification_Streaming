The jellyfish are most often spotted during the late summer and autumn, when they have grown to a large size and the currents begin to sweep them to shore.\n\nLike other jellyfish, lion's manes are capable of both [[sexual reproduction]] in the [[medusa (biology)|medusa]] stage and [[asexual reproduction]] in the [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] stage.<ref name=\"typesofjellyfish1\" /> Lion's mane jellyfish have four different stages in their year-long lifespan: a larval stage, a polyp stage, an [[Jellyfish#Phases|ephyrae]] stage, and the medusa stage.<ref name=\"typesofjellyfish1\" /> The female jellyfish carries its fertilized eggs in its tentacle, where the eggs grow into larva. When the larva are old enough, the female deposits them on a hard surface, where the larva soon grow into [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s. The polyps begin to reproduce asexually, creating stacks of small creatures called ephyrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/pub/seascience/jellyfi.html |title=SCDNR \u2013 Jelly fish |publisher=Dnr.sc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> The individual ephyrae break off the stacks, where they eventually grow into the medusa stage and become full-grown jellyfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/open-ocean/2/2 |title=Open ocean \u2013 Jellyfish life cycle \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref>\n\n== Sting and human contact ==\nMost encounters cause temporary\npain and localized redness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/lions-mane-jellyfish.html |title=Lion's Mane Jellyfish |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> In normal circumstances, and in healthy individuals, their stings are not known to be fatal. [[Vinegar]] can be used to deactivate the [[nematocyst]]s, but due to the large number of tentacles, medical attention is recommended after exposure.\n\nThere may be a significant difference between touching a few tentacles with fingertips at a beach and accidentally swimming into one. The initial sensation is more strange than painful and feels like swimming into warmer and somewhat effervescent water. Some minor pains will soon follow. Normally there is no real danger to humans (with the exception of people suffering from special allergies). But in cases when someone has been stung over large parts of their body by not just the longest tentacles but the entire jellyfish (including the inner tentacles, of which there are around 1,200<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\">{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/61609/15-facts-about-lions-mane-jellyfish|title=15 Facts About the Lion's Mane Jellyfish|date=15 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>), \nmedical attention is recommended. Although rare, at deep water severe stings can also cause panic followed by drowning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jellyfish-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353284|title=Jellyfish stings - Symptoms and causes|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\"/>\n\nOn a July day in 2010, around 150 beachgoers were stung by the remains of a lion's mane jellyfish that had broken up into countless pieces in [[Wallis Sands State Beach]], [[Rye, New Hampshire|Rye]], [[New Hampshire]], in the United States. Considering the size of the species, it is possible that this incident was caused by a single specimen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmur.com/news/24341753/detail.html |title=150 Stung By Jellyfish At Rye Beach \u2013 New Hampshire News Story \u2013 WMUR Manchester |publisher=Wmur.com |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2010-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014004929/http://www.wmur.com/news/24341753/detail.html |archivedate=2011-10-14 }}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe lion's mane jellyfish appears in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short story \"[[The Adventure of the Lion's Mane]]\" published in ''[[The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes]]''. Holmes discovers at the end of the story that the true killer of a professor who died shortly after going swimming (shouting \"the lion's mane\" before he succumbed) was actually this jellyfish. Suspicion was originally laid upon the professor's rival in love, until the latter was similarly attacked (he survived, although badly stung). In the context of the story, it is only because the school professor has a weak heart that he succumbs, as is confirmed by the survival of the second victim.\n\nA photograph widely distributed on the internet appears to show an anomalously large lion's mane dwarfing a nearby [[scuba diving|diver]] by several times. The photo was subsequently shown to be a hoax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoaxorfact.com/pranks/picture-of-giant-lion-s-mane-jellyfish-facts.html|title=Picture of Giant Lion's Mane Jellyfish - Facts - Hoax Or Fact|website=www.hoaxorfact.com}}</ref>\n\nOn the popular television program ''[[QI#Mistakes and corrections|QI]]'' the show claimed that the longest animal in the world was the lion's mane jellyfish. This was later corrected \u2013 in 1864, a [[bootlace worm]] (''Lineus longissimus'') was found washed up on a Scottish shore that was {{convert|180|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=in}} long. (''That'' claim has its critics: because bootlace worms can easily stretch to several times their natural length, it is possible the worm did not actually grow to be that length.)<ref>[[Mark Carwardine|Carwardine, M.]] 1995.
