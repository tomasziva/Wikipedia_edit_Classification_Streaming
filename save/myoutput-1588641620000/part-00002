Members of WASP became trained pilots who tested aircraft, ferried aircraft, and trained other pilots. Their purpose was to free male pilots for combat roles during [[World War II]]. Despite various members of the armed forces being involved in the creation of the program, the WASP and its members had no military standing.\n\nWASP was preceded by the [[Women's Flying Training Detachment]] (WFTD) and the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS). Both were organized separately in September 1942. They were pioneering organizations of civilian women pilots, who were attached to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] to fly military aircraft during World War II. On August 5, 1943, the WFTD and WAFS merged to create the WASP organization.\n\nThe WASP arrangement with the US Army Air Forces ended on December 20, 1944. During its period of operation, each member's service had freed a male pilot for military combat or other duties. They flew over 60&nbsp;million miles; transported every type of military aircraft; towed targets for live anti-aircraft gun practice; simulated strafing missions and transported cargo. Thirty-eight WASP members lost their lives and one disappeared while on a ferry mission, her fate still unknown as of 2019.<ref name=\"Ulre\">{{cite book|last1=Ure|first1=James|title=Seized by the Sun: The Life and Disappearance of World War II Pilot Gertrude Tompkins|date=2017|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781613735909|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fvR_DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT158&lpg=PT158&dq=Gertrude+Tompkins+Silver#v=onepage&q=Gertrude%20Tompkins%20Silver&f=false|language=en}}</ref> In 1977, for their World War II service, the members were granted [[veteran]] status,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124533914 |title=WWII Female Pilots Honored With Gold Medal |date=March 10, 2010 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |accessdate=May 25, 2019}}</ref> and in 2009 awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].<ref name=\"gpo\">{{cite web|title=Women Airforce Service Pilots Congressional Gold Medal|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ40/html/PLAW-111publ40.htm|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"thune.senate.gov\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2009/5/press-release-026b5888-86e0-4688-a4fc-e9e680ea96e4|title=Thune Recognizes Women Airforce Service Pilots from World War II|last=|first=|date=May 21, 2009|work=United States Senator John Thune|accessdate=2013-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224124156/https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2009/5/press-release-026b5888-86e0-4688-a4fc-e9e680ea96e4|archive-date=24 December 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Creation of the WASP==\nWASP started out as two separate organizations.

The U.S. was building its air power and military presence in anticipation of direct involvement in the conflict, and had belatedly begun to drastically expand its men in uniform. This period led to the dramatic increase in activity for the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], because of obvious gaps in \"manpower\" that could be filled by women. To compensate for the manpower demands of the military after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the government encouraged women to enter the workforce to fill both industrial and service jobs supporting the war effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu/research/americanhistory/ap_ww2-pearl.php#pearl|title=Pearl Harbor and Mobilization|website=Eagleton Institute of Politics|publisher=Rutgers University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517093957/http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu:80/research/americanhistory/ap_ww2-pearl.php|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=}}</ref>{{Sfn|Monahan|Neidel-Greenlee|2010|p=123-124}}\n\n===WAFS===\n[[File:Women's_Auxiliary_Ferrying_Squadron_pilots,_March_7,_1943.jpg|thumb|Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) pilots, March 7, 1943]]\nNancy Harkness Love's husband, Robert Love, was part of the Army Air Corps Reserve and worked for Colonel [[William H.

Members of WASP became trained pilots who tested aircraft, ferried aircraft, and trained other pilots. Their purpose was to free male pilots for combat roles during [[World War II]]. Despite various members of the armed forces being involved in the creation of the program, the WASP and its members had no military standing.\n\nWASP was preceded by the [[Women's Flying Training Detachment]] (WFTD) and the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS). Both were organized separately in September 1942. They were pioneering organizations of civilian women pilots, who were attached to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] to fly military aircraft during World War II. On August 5, 1943, the WFTD and WAFS merged to create the WASP organization.\n\nThe WASP arrangement with the US Army Air Forces ended on December 20, 1944. During its period of operation, each member's service had freed a male pilot for military combat or other duties. They flew over 60&nbsp;million miles; transported every type of military aircraft; towed targets for live anti-aircraft gun practice; simulated strafing missions and transported cargo.

The U.S. was building its air power and military presence in anticipation of direct involvement in the conflict, and had belatedly begun to drastically expand its men in uniform. This period led to the dramatic increase in activity for the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], because of obvious gaps in \"manpower\" that could be filled by women. To compensate for the manpower demands of the military after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the government encouraged women to enter the workforce to fill both industrial and service jobs supporting the war effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu/research/americanhistory/ap_ww2-pearl.php#pearl|title=Pearl Harbor and Mobilization|website=Eagleton Institute of Politics|publisher=Rutgers University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517093957/http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu:80/research/americanhistory/ap_ww2-pearl.php|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=}}</ref>{{Sfn|Monahan|Neidel-Greenlee|2010|p=123-124}}\n\n===WAFS===\n[[File:Women's_Auxiliary_Ferrying_Squadron_pilots,_March_7,_1943.jpg|thumb|Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) pilots, March 7, 1943]]\nNancy Harkness Love's husband, Robert Love, was part of the Army Air Corps Reserve and worked for Colonel [[William H.
