The river passes through the city and meanders through the valley, moving onward and deepening in the [[Wular Lake]]. The city is known for its nine old bridges, connecting the two parts of the city.\n\nThere are a number of lakes and swamps in and around the city. These include the [[Dal Lake|Dal]], the [[Nigeen Lake|Nigeen]], the [[Anchar Lake|Anchar]], [[Khushal Sar]], [[Gil Sar]] and [[Hokersar]].\n\nHokersar is a wetland situated near Srinagar. Thousands of migratory birds come to Hokersar from Siberia and other regions in the winter season. Migratory birds from Siberia and Central Asia use wetlands in Kashmir as their transitory camps between September and October and again around spring. These wetlands play a vital role in sustaining a large population of wintering, staging and breeding birds.\n\nHokersar is {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}} north of Srinagar, and is a world class wetland spread over {{convert|13.75|km2|abbr=on}} including lake and [[Marsh|marshy area]]. It is the most accessible and well-known of Kashmir's [[wetlands]] which include Hygam, Shalibug and Mirgund. A record number of migratory birds have visited Hokersar in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/migratory-birds-flock-avian-paradise/article5331924.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|title=Migratory birds flock avian paradise|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=22 June 2017|author=Ahmed Ali Fayyaz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109140840/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/migratory-birds-flock-avian-paradise/article5331924.ece|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBirds found in Hokersar are migratory [[duck]]s and [[geese]] which include [[brahminy duck]], [[tufted duck]], [[gadwall]], [[garganey]], [[greylag goose]], [[mallard]], [[common merganser]], [[northern pintail]], [[common pochard]], [[ferruginous pochard]], [[red-crested pochard]], [[ruddy shelduck]], [[northern shoveller]], [[common teal]], and [[Eurasian wigeon]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Climate==\nSrinagar has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''). The valley is surrounded by the Himalayas on all sides. Winters are cool, with daytime temperature averaging to  {{convert|2.5|\u00b0C|1}}, and drops below freezing point at night. Moderate to heavy snowfall occurs in winter and the [[Srinagar Jammu National Highway|highway]] connecting  Srinagar with the rest of India faces frequent blockades due to icy roads and avalanches. Summers are warm with a July daytime average of {{convert|24.1|\u00b0C|1}}. The average annual rainfall is around {{convert|720|mm}}. Spring is the wettest season while autumn is the driest.

The river passes through the city and meanders through the valley, moving onward and deepening in the [[Wular Lake]]. The city is known for its nine old bridges, connecting the two parts of the city.\n\nThere are a number of lakes and swamps in and around the city. These include the [[Dal Lake|Dal]], the [[Nigeen Lake|Nigeen]], the [[Anchar Lake|Anchar]], [[Khushal Sar]], [[Gil Sar]] and [[Hokersar]].\n\nHokersar is a wetland situated near Srinagar. Thousands of migratory birds come to Hokersar from Siberia and other regions in the winter season. Migratory birds from Siberia and Central Asia use wetlands in Kashmir as their transitory camps between September and October and again around spring. These wetlands play a vital role in sustaining a large population of wintering, staging and breeding birds.\n\nHokersar is {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}} north of Srinagar, and is a world class wetland spread over {{convert|13.75|km2|abbr=on}} including lake and [[Marsh|marshy area]]. It is the most accessible and well-known of Kashmir's [[wetlands]] which include Hygam, Shalibug and Mirgund. A record number of migratory birds have visited Hokersar in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/migratory-birds-flock-avian-paradise/article5331924.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|title=Migratory birds flock avian paradise|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=22 June 2017|author=Ahmed Ali Fayyaz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109140840/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/migratory-birds-flock-avian-paradise/article5331924.ece|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBirds found in Hokersar are migratory [[duck]]s and [[geese]] which include [[brahminy duck]], [[tufted duck]], [[gadwall]], [[garganey]], [[greylag goose]], [[mallard]], [[common merganser]], [[northern pintail]], [[common pochard]], [[ferruginous pochard]], [[red-crested pochard]], [[ruddy shelduck]], [[northern shoveller]], [[common teal]], and [[Eurasian wigeon]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Climate==\nSrinagar has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''). The valley is surrounded by the Himalayas on all sides. Winters are cool, with daytime temperature averaging to  {{convert|2.5|\u00b0C|1}}, and drops below freezing point at night. Moderate to heavy snowfall occurs in winter and the [[Srinagar Jammu National Highway|highway]] connecting  Srinagar with the rest of India faces frequent blockades due to icy roads and avalanches. Summers are warm with a July daytime average of {{convert|24.1|\u00b0C|1}}. The average annual rainfall is around {{convert|720|mm}}. Spring is the wettest season while autumn is the driest.
