Since the 1960s, Dyke has had a long career in the UK in [[Print journalism|print]] and then [[broadcast journalism]]. He is credited with introducing '[[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]]' television to British broadcasting, and reviving the ratings of [[TV-am]]. In the 1990s, he held chief executive positions at [[London Weekend Television|LWT Group]], [[Pearson Television]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].\n\nHe was the [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]] of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] from January 2000 to January 2004; he resigned following heavy criticism of the BBC's news reporting process in the [[Hutton Inquiry]].\n\nDyke was a director of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and chairman of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] football clubs, and from 2013 to 2016 was chairman of [[the Football Association]]. He was [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of York]] from 2004 to 2015 and chairman of the [[British Film Institute]] between 2008 and 2016.

During his time at York, Dyke was active in student politics, and was part of a collective that produced a psychedelic underground student magazine called ''Nouse''.

He had become disillusioned with newspaper journalism, and tried for a job as a junior reporter at BBC Radio Teesside. He was unsuccessful, apparently because the interviewers felt no-one would understand his accent. Dyke instead found work covering rural affairs for the [[The Journal (newspaper)|Newcastle Journal]]. He moved back to London with Christine in 1974 to become campaign officer for the Wandsworth Community Relations Council. He hated the job and left to campaign to be elected GLC councillor for Putney.

Dyke got a junior position on LWT's local politics programme, in the current affairs department. His bosses there were [[John Birt]] and [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]]. He attracted attention for trying to give the programmes he worked on a more populist edge. This led to him being given the chance to launch a new early evening current affairs topical news programme. This became ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]'', fronted by [[Michael Aspel]], with co-hosts [[Danny Baker]] and [[Janet Street-Porter]]. The show is seen by many as the first example of British tabloid TV.<ref name= horrie/>\n\nAfter the success of ''The Six O' Clock Show'', Dyke was brought in by [[Jonathan Aitken]] to become programme director at ailing station [[TV-am]] in April 1983.<ref>Camden Lock soap opera gets new leading man.By David Hewson.

In 1992 Dyke was appointed the chairman of the ITV Council, and LWT chief executive.  In February 1993 Dyke was appointed chairman of the GMTV board and tasked with overhauling the station format, which included \"more popular journalism\".

Also in 1997 he was asked to review the Patients' Charter of the National Health Service.\n\n===At the BBC===\nIn 2000, he took over from [[John Birt]] as [[Director-General of the BBC]]. He was appointed despite Conservative protests that he had donated \u00a350,000 to the Labour Party and was a 'crony'.[https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/jun/25/bbc] At the beginning of his tenure, he famously promised to \"cut the crap\" at the Corporation. The \"crap\" he referred to was the complex internal market Birt had introduced at the BBC which, it is claimed, turned employees away from making programmes and into managers. Dyke reversed this trend \u2013 he reduced administration costs from 24% of total income to 15%. Unusually for a recent Director-General, he had a good rapport with his employees and was popular with the majority of BBC staff, his management style being seen as more open and risk-taking than Birt's.\n\nJonathan Gifford, who worked for BBC Magazines in BBC Worldwide during the management of Birt and Dyke, observed \"Dyke came across well. He was direct, sensible and approachable. His vision for the BBC was inspirational.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Gifford |title=Greg Dyke and John Birt: lessons in leadership |url=http://jonathangifford.com/business-and-leadership/greg-dyke-and-john-birt-lessons-in-leadership/|work=Author on leadership |publisher=Jonathan Gifford |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2011 }}</ref> Martin Montague, a producer on digital radio station BBC7 said \"I know that people in local radio think he walks on water because of all that he's put into that.\"<ref name=\"walk_out\">{{cite news |author=PA News |title=BBC staff walk out over Dyke resignation |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1006610.ece |work=Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=29 January 2004 |accessdate=12 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nApart from restoring staff morale, Dyke laid claim to two major achievements during his office. In 2002, he introduced the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] terrestrial digital transmission platform with six additional BBC channels, and persuaded Sky TV to join the consortium. Previously this was an [[ITV Digital|ITV subscription service]] that had closed with major losses, but by mid-2007 it could be seen by more than half the population.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dyke|first=Greg|title=Freeview: Former BBC boss Greg Dyke charts its rise and rise|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/freeview-former-bbc-boss-greg-dyke-charts-its-rise-and-rise-398184.html|work=The Independent, Monday, 29 October 2007|accessdate=17 July 2011|location=London|date=29 October 2007}}</ref> After leaving the BBC, he said that he always realised that the introduction of Freeview helped to prevent a subscription funding model for the BBC gain traction, because it is impossible for broadcasters to switch off the signal to individual Freeview boxes.\n\nDyke controversially described the Corporation in early 2001 as \"hideously white\",<ref>{{cite news |title=Dyke: BBC is 'hideously white' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1104305.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 January 2001 |accessdate=4 May 2010 }}</ref> based on statistics that showed the organisation's management structure was 98% white. Dyke said that \"The figures we have at the moment suggest that quite a lot of people from different ethnic backgrounds that we do attract to the BBC leave. Maybe they don't feel at home, maybe they don't feel welcome.\" Dyke set a target that by 2003, 10% of the BBC's UK workforce and 4% of management would be from ethnic minority backgrounds. In September 2004, Dyke received an award for his remarks from Glasgow-based organisation Empower Scotland, which fights against workplace racism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dyke gets racial equality award |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3952619.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDyke attracted criticism when he \"forgot\" to sell an equity stake in Granada Television, which presented a conflict of interest in his new position. He also caused controversy when he lost the rights to Premier League football to ITV, then accused the league of fixing the auction. Others were worried that the openness and high risk strategies of his management style could backfire on the corporation. An ITV executive was quoted as saying, \"By being too radical and playing fast and loose with the public service remit, the BBC is inviting external regulation \u2013 and it deserves it.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Robins |title=The first 100 days of Greg Dyke |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-first-100-days-of-greg-dyke-707382.html |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print |date=11 July 2000 |accessdate=12 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Dyke said he thought the separation between the \"political class\", including the BBC, and the public had never been greater. He said he had tried to raise the problem during his time in charge of the BBC but discussion had been blocked by a combination of the \"politicos on the board of governors\" of the BBC, the Labour cabinet and the political journalists at the BBC. He believed that these groups resist change as it is not in their interests.<ref>{{cite news |title= Dyke in BBC 'conspiracy' claim |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8265628.stm| work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===Hutton Report and resignation from BBC===\n{{Main|Hutton Enquiry}}\nDyke resigned from the BBC on 29 January 2004 along with [[Gavyn Davies]] and [[Andrew Gilligan]], after the publication of the [[Hutton Report]] into the circumstances surrounding the death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]]. [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Hutton]] described Dyke's approach to checking news stories as \"defective\"; when Alastair Campbell complained about the story, Dyke had immediately defended it without investigating whether there was any merit to the complaint.\n\nIn an email sent to all BBC staff just prior to his resignation Dyke wrote:\n{{cquote|I accept that the BBC made errors of judgement and I've sadly come to the conclusion that it will be hard to draw a line under this whole affair while I am still here.

However, he was only able to secure the support of about one-third of the Governors.\n\nSome BBC staff felt that too much blame had been placed on their organisation in the wake of the [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]] affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC.<ref name=\"walk_out\"/> Tim Gospill, spokesman for the [[National Union of Journalists]] said \"Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government telling you what to do.

Also in 1997 he was asked to review the Patients' Charter of the National Health Service.\n\n===At the BBC===\nIn 2000, he took over from [[John Birt]] as [[Director-General of the BBC]]. He was appointed despite Conservative protests that he had donated \u00a350,000 to the Labour Party and was a 'crony'.[https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/jun/25/bbc] At the beginning of his tenure, he famously promised to \"cut the crap\" at the Corporation. The \"crap\" he referred to was the complex internal market Birt had introduced at the BBC which, it is claimed, turned employees away from making programmes and into managers. Dyke reversed this trend \u2013 he reduced administration costs from 24% of total income to 15%. Unusually for a recent Director-General, he had a good rapport with his employees and was popular with the majority of BBC staff, his management style being seen as more open and risk-taking than Birt's.\n\nJonathan Gifford, who worked for BBC Magazines in BBC Worldwide during the management of Birt and Dyke, observed \"Dyke came across well. He was direct, sensible and approachable. His vision for the BBC was inspirational.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Gifford |title=Greg Dyke and John Birt: lessons in leadership |url=http://jonathangifford.com/business-and-leadership/greg-dyke-and-john-birt-lessons-in-leadership/|work=Author on leadership |publisher=Jonathan Gifford |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2011 }}</ref> Martin Montague, a producer on digital radio station BBC7 said \"I know that people in local radio think he walks on water because of all that he's put into that.\"<ref name=\"walk_out\">{{cite news |author=PA News |title=BBC staff walk out over Dyke resignation |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1006610.ece |work=Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=29 January 2004 |accessdate=12 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nApart from restoring staff morale, Dyke laid claim to two major achievements during his office. In 2002, he introduced the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] terrestrial digital transmission platform with six additional BBC channels, and persuaded Sky TV to join the consortium. Previously this was an [[ITV Digital|ITV subscription service]] that had closed with major losses, but by mid-2007 it could be seen by more than half the population.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dyke|first=Greg|title=Freeview: Former BBC boss Greg Dyke charts its rise and rise|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/freeview-former-bbc-boss-greg-dyke-charts-its-rise-and-rise-398184.html|work=The Independent, Monday, 29 October 2007|accessdate=17 July 2011|location=London|date=29 October 2007}}</ref> After leaving the BBC, he said that he always realised that the introduction of Freeview helped to prevent a subscription funding model for the BBC gain traction, because it is impossible for broadcasters to switch off the signal to individual Freeview boxes.\n\nDyke controversially described the Corporation in early 2001 as \"hideously white\",<ref>{{cite news |title=Dyke: BBC is 'hideously white' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1104305.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 January 2001 |accessdate=4 May 2010 }}</ref> based on statistics that showed the organisation's management structure was 98% white. Dyke said that \"The figures we have at the moment suggest that quite a lot of people from different ethnic backgrounds that we do attract to the BBC leave. Maybe they don't feel at home, maybe they don't feel welcome.\" Dyke set a target that by 2003, 10% of the BBC's UK workforce and 4% of management would be from ethnic minority backgrounds. In September 2004, Dyke received an award for his remarks from Glasgow-based organisation Empower Scotland, which fights against workplace racism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dyke gets racial equality award |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3952619.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDyke attracted criticism when he \"forgot\" to sell an equity stake in Granada Television, which presented a conflict of interest in his new position. He also caused controversy when he lost the rights to Premier League football to ITV, then accused the league of fixing the auction. Others were worried that the openness and high risk strategies of his management style could backfire on the corporation. An ITV executive was quoted as saying, \"By being too radical and playing fast and loose with the public service remit, the BBC is inviting external regulation \u2013 and it deserves it.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Robins |title=The first 100 days of Greg Dyke |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-first-100-days-of-greg-dyke-707382.html |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print |date=11 July 2000 |accessdate=12 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Dyke said he thought the separation between the \"political class\", including the BBC, and the public had never been greater. He said he had tried to raise the problem during his time in charge of the BBC but discussion had been blocked by a combination of the \"politicos on the board of governors\" of the BBC, the Labour cabinet and the political journalists at the BBC. He believed that these groups resist change as it is not in their interests.<ref>{{cite news |title= Dyke in BBC 'conspiracy' claim |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8265628.stm| work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===Hutton Report and resignation from BBC===\n{{Main|Hutton Enquiry}}\nDyke resigned from the BBC on 29 January 2004 along with [[Gavyn Davies]] and [[Andrew Gilligan]], after the publication of the [[Hutton Report]] into the circumstances surrounding the death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]].
