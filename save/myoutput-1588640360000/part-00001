The [[Army of the Andes]] of the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] led by [[General]] [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] defeated the Spanish force led by [[Rafael Maroto]]. It was a defeat for the [[Captaincy General of Chile]], the royalist government established after the division of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1814, having been instrumental in the establishment of a popularly elected congress in Argentina, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] began to consider the problem of driving the Spanish royalists from South America entirely. He realized that the first step would be to expel them from [[Chile]], and, to this end, he set about recruiting and equipping an army. In just under two years, he had an army of some 6,000 men, 1,200 horses and 22 cannons.\n\nOn January 17, 1817, he set out with this force and began the [[crossing of the Andes]]. Careful planning on his part had meant that the royalist forces in Chile were deployed to meet threats that did not exist, and his crossing went unopposed. Nonetheless, the [[Army of the Andes]] (as San Martin's force was called) suffered heavy losses during the crossing, losing as much as one-third of its men and more than half of its horses. San Martin found himself allying with Chilean patriot [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who commanded his own army.\n\nThe royalists rushed north in response to their approach, and a force of about 1,500 under Brigadier [[Rafael Maroto]] blocked San Martin's advance at a valley called Chacabuco, <!--[[Chacabuco]] is not this one --> near Santiago. In the face of the disintegration of the royalist forces, Maroto proposed abandoning the capital and retreating southward, where they could hold out and obtain resources for a new campaign. The military conference called by Royal Governor Field Marshal [[Casimiro Marc\u00f3 del Pont]] on February 8 adopted Maroto's strategy, but the following morning, the Captain General changed his mind and ordered Maroto to prepare for battle in Chacabuco.\n\nThe night before the clash, [[Antonio de Quintanilla]], who would later distinguish himself extraordinarily in the defense of [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilo\u00e9]], confided to another Spanish official his opinion of the ill-chosen strategy: Given the position of the insurgents, the royalist forces ought to retreat a few leagues towards the hills of [[Colina, Chile|Colina]]. \"Maroto overheard this conversation from a nearby chamber and either couldn't or refused to hear me because of his pride and self-importance, called on an attendant with his notorious hoarse voice and proclaimed a general decree on pain of death, to whoever suggested a retreat.\"\n\nAll Maroto and his troops had to do was delay San Martin, as he knew that further royalist reinforcements were on the way from Santiago. San Martin was well aware of this as well and opted to attack while he still had the numerical advantage.\n\n==Prelude==\nSan Mart\u00edn received numerous reports of the Spanish plans from a spy dressed as a ''roto'', a poverty-stricken peasant of Chile. The ''roto'' told him that the Spanish general, Marc\u00f3, knew of fighting in the mountains and told his army to \"run to the field\", which refers to Chacabuco. He also told San Mart\u00edn the plan of General Rafael Maroto, the leader of the Talavera Regiment and a force of volunteers of up to 2,000 men. His plan was to take the mountainside and launch an attack against San Mart\u00edn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rojas|1945|pp=110\u2013115}}.</ref>\n\nOn February 11, three days before his planned date of attack, San Mart\u00edn called a war council to decide on a plan. Their main goal was to take the Chacabuco Ranch, the royalist headquarters, at the bottom of the hills. He decided to split his 2,000 troops into two parts, sending them down two roads on either side of the mountain. The right contingent was led by [[Miguel Estanislao Soler]], and the left by O\u2019Higgins. The plan was for Soler to attack their flanks, while at the same time surrounding their rear guard in order to prevent their retreat. San Mart\u00edn expected that both leaders would attack at the same time, so the royalists would have to fight a battle on two fronts.<ref name=\"Harvey p. 346-9\">{{Harvnb|Harvey|2000|pp=346\u2013349}}.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nSan Mart\u00edn sent his troops down the mountain starting at midnight of the 11th to prepare for an attack at dawn. At dawn, his troops were much closer to the royalists than anticipated, but fought hard and heroically. Meanwhile, Soler's troops had to go down a tiny path that proved long and arduous and took longer than expected. General O\u2019Higgins, supposedly seeing his homeland and being overcome with passion, defied the plan of attack and charged, along with his 1,500. What exactly happened in this part of the battle is fiercely debated. O\u2019Higgins claimed that the royalists stopped their retreat and started advancing towards his troops. He said that if he were to lead his men back up the narrow path and retreat, his men would have been decimated, one by one. San Mart\u00edn saw O\u2019Higgins premature advance and ordered Soler to charge the royalist flank, which took the pressure off O\u2019Higgins and allowed his troops to hold their ground.\n\nThe ensuing firefight lasted into the afternoon. The tide turned for the Army of the Andes as Soler captured a key royalist artillery point. At this point, the royalists set up a defensive square around the Chacabuco Ranch. O\u2019Higgins charged the center of the royalist position, while Soler got into position behind the royalists, effectively cutting off any chance of retreat. O\u2019Higgins and his men overwhelmed the royalist troops. When they attempted to retreat, Soler's men cut them off and pushed towards the ranch. Hand-to-hand combat ensued in and around the ranch until every royalist soldier was dead or taken captive. 500 royalist soldiers were killed and 600 taken prisoner. The Army of the Andes only lost twelve men in battle, but an additional 120 lost their lives from wounds suffered during the battle.<ref name=\"Harvey p. 346-9\" /> Maroto succeeded in escaping, thanks to the speed of his horse, but was slightly injured.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{expand section|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe remaining royalist troops left Chile and retreated to [[Lima]] by ship. Interim governor [[Francisco Ruiz-Tagle]] presided at an assembly, which designated San Mart\u00edn as governor, but he turned down the offer and requested a new assembly, which made O'Higgins Supreme Director of Chile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmartiniano.gov.ar/documentos/documento060.php |title=La Batalla de Chacabuco - Por Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre (1821-1906) |website=Instituto Nacional Sanmartiniano - Documentos |publisher=Secretar\u00eda de Cultura - Instituto Nacional Sanmartiniano |language=Spanish |access-date=13 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329204103/http://www.sanmartiniano.gov.ar/documentos/documento060.php |archivedate=29 March 2016 }}</ref>  This marks the beginning of the \"[[Patria Nueva]]\" period in Chile's history.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chilean Independence]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n| title    = Liberators: Latin America's Struggle for Independence\n| first    = Robert | last = Harvey | year = 2000 | publisher = The Overlook Press\n| location = New York | isbn=1-58567-284-X |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book\n| title     = San Mart\u00edn: Knight of the Andes\n| first     = Ricardo\n| last      = Rojas\n| year      = 1945\n| publisher = Doubleyday, Doran & Company\n| location  = New York \n|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=Seamos libres y lo dem\u00e1s no importa nada |trans-title=Let us be free and nothing else matters |last=Galasso |first=Norberto |authorlink=Norberto Galasso |year=2000 |publisher=Colihue |location=Buenos Aires |language=Spanish |isbn=978-950-581-779-5 |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Battle of Chacabuco}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060211022111/http://www.crucedelosandes.com.ar/batalla_chacabuco.asp A document by Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre, who became the argentine President, detailing the battle] {{in lang|es}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081009182752/http://www.turismochile.com/temas/principales_batallas/articulos/355 Batalla de Chacabuco en Turismochile.com]\n*[http://www.emol.com/encuestas/GBC/pdf/Curso3EscuelaMilitar.pdf Batalla de Chacabuco en emol.com]\n\n{{coord|32|59|35|S|70|41|2|W|display=title}}\n{{San Mart\u00edn}}\n{{Spanish Empire}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chacabuco, Battle of}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1817]]\n[[Category:1817 in the Captaincy General of Chile]]\n[[Category:Battles involving Chile]]\n[[Category:Battles involving Spain]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Spanish American wars of independence]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Chilean War of Independence]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Patria Nueva Campaign]]\n[[Category:February 1817 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of Chacabuco\n| partof      = the [[Chilean War of Independence]] and the [[Argentine War of Independence]]\n| image       = Battle of Chacabuco.jpg\n| image_size  = 300px\n| caption     = Chilean and Argentine troops marching to the Battle of Chacabuco\n| date        = February 12, 1817\n| place       = near [[Santiago, Chile]]\n|map_type    =Chile\n|coordinates = {{coord|-32.993056|-70.683889|type:event|display=inline}}\n|map_size    =300px\n|map_caption =\n|map_label   =\n|territory    =\n| result      = Victory for the Army of the Andes\n| combatant1  = [[File:Flag of Mendoza Province, Argentina.svg|border|22px]] [[Army of the Andes]]\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon|Spain|1785}} Spanish [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalists]]\n| commander1  = [[File:Flag of Argentina.svg|22px]] [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]<br>[[File:Flag of Chile.svg|border|22px]] [[Bernardo O'Higgins]]<br>[[File:Flag of Argentina.svg|22px]] [[Miguel Estanislao Soler]]\n| commander2  = {{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Rafael Maroto]]\n| strength1   = 3,600 <ref name=\"Galasso220\">{{Harvnb|Galasso|2000|p=220}}.</ref> - 4,000 men <ref> Fr\u00edas, 1978</ref> (Infantry and Cavalry) <br>9 artillery<ref name=\"Galasso220\"/>\n| strength2   = 1,400 <ref>Encina Castedo 2006</ref>-2,450 Infantry<ref name=\"Galasso220\"/><br>5 artillery<ref name=\"Galasso220\"/>\n: Spaniards <160 men <ref>Rafael de la Presa Casanueva (1978)</ref>\n| casualties1 = 100 killed/wounded\n| casualties2 = 500 killed/wounded<br>600 prisoners\n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Chilean War of Independence}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Chacabuco''', fought during the [[Chilean War of Independence]], occurred on February 12, 1817.
