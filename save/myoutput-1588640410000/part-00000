'''Joshua Leavitt''' (September 8, 1794, [[Heath, Massachusetts]] \u2013 January 16, 1873, [[Brooklyn, New York]]) was an American [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] and former lawyer who became a prominent writer, editor and publisher of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] literature. He was also a spokesman for the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]] and a prominent campaigner for cheap postage. Leavitt served as editor of ''[[The Emancipator]]'', ''The New York Independent'', ''The New York Evangelist'', and other periodicals. He was the first secretary of the [[American Temperance Society]] and co-founder of the New York City Anti-Slavery Society.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://americanabolitionist.liberalarts.iupui.edu/leavitt.htm |title=Leavitt, Joshua |access-date=2008-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907042409/http://americanabolitionist.liberalarts.iupui.edu/leavitt.htm |archive-date=2006-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Heath, Massachusetts]], in [[the Berkshires]], Leavitt attended [[Yale College]], where he graduated at age twenty. He subsequently studied law and practiced for a time in [[Putney, Vermont]], before matriculating at the [[Yale Divinity School|Yale Theological Seminary]] for a three-year course of study. He was subsequently ordained as a [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] clergyman at [[Stratford, Connecticut]].  After four years in Stratford, Rev. Leavitt decamped for New York City, where he first became secretary of the American Seamens' Friend Society, and began his 44-year career as editor of ''Sailors' Magazine''. Thus was Leavitt launched on his career as social reformer, temperance spokesman, editor, abolitionist and religious proselytizer.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v8UdyMySRJwC&pg=RA1-PA236&dq=%22joshua+leavitt%22+heath+massachusetts&lr=&ei=v9_CSMSELaPOtAOc96nYDA A History of the Churches and Ministers, and of Franklin Association, Theophilus Packard, Boston, 1854]</ref>\n\n[[File:Emancipator.png|thumb|left|200px|''The Emancipator'', an abolitionist broadsheet edited by Rev.

In 1841, for instance, Leavitt published his \"Financial Power of Slavery\", a compelling document which argued that the South was draining the national economy through its reliance on slavery.\n\n==''The Christian Lyre''==\nLeavitt published ''The Christian Lyre'' in 1830<ref>Scan at https://archive.org/details/christianlyre00leav/</ref>, the \"first American tunebook to take the form of a modern hymnal, with music for every hymn (melody and bass only) and the multistanza hymns printed in full, under or beside the music\".
