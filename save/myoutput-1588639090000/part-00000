{"title_page": "Midshipman", "text_new": "{{short description|Officer cadet}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n{{military ranks}}\n{{navalranks}}\nA '''midshipman''' is an officer of the lowest [[Military rank#Subordinate/student officer|rank]], in the [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]], and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canada]] (Naval Cadet), [[Royal Australian Navy|Australia]], [[Bangladesh Navy|Bangladesh]], [[Namibian Navy|Namibia]], [[Royal New Zealand Navy|New Zealand]], [[South African Navy|South Africa]], [[Indian Navy|India]], [[Pakistan Navy|Pakistan]], [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Singapore]], [[Sri Lanka Navy|Sri Lanka]], and [[Kenya Navy|Kenya]]. \n\nIn the 17th century, a midshipman was a [[Naval rating|rating]] for an experienced seaman, and the word derives from the area aboard a ship, [[amidships]], either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was [[Berth (sleeping)|berthed]]. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the [[Napoleonic era]] (1793\u20131815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served at least three years as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day [[petty officer]] in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or [[master's mate]], he was eligible to take the examination for [[lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]]. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipmen in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a [[warrant officer]] rank until 1912.\n\nDuring the 19th century, changes in the training of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a [[Military academy|naval college]]. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time at sea declined to less than a year as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.\n\nRanks equivalent to midshipman exist in many other navies. Using US midshipman or pre-fleet board UK midshipman as the basis for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer. Using post-fleet board UK midshipman for comparison, the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure, and similar to a US ensign in role and responsibility. In many [[Romance language]]s, the literal translation of the local term for \"midshipman\" into English is \"Navy Guard\", including the French ''garde marine'', Spanish ''guardia marina'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''guarda-marinha'', and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''guardiamarina''. Today, these ranks all refer to naval cadets, but historically they were selected by the monarchy and were trained mostly on land as soldiers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Apprentice officers===\n\n====Royal Navy (1662\u20131836)====\n\n=====Origins=====\n[[Image:Thomas Rowlandson-midship.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A full size portrait of a boy with long golden hair wearing the uniform of a midshipman: a bicorne hat, a blue tails coat with white patches on the collar, a white waistcoat, breeches and hose, and a sword on the left side|Midshipman of the [[Royal Navy]] (''c''. 1799),<ref name=NMMImage>{{cite web |url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConGallery.57/Ranksin-Nelsons-navy.html |title= Ranks in Nelson's Navy|accessdate=20 February 2009|work=Port Cities London |publisher=National Maritime Museum}}</ref> by [[Thomas Rowlandson]]]]\nThe rank of midshipman originated during the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period (England)|Stuart]] eras, and originally referred to a post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the [[Main-mast|main]] and [[mizzen mast|mizzen]] masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training.<ref name=\"Penn34\">{{Harvnb|Penn|1957|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> The first published use of the term midshipman was in 1662.<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite web | title=midshipman, n. | work=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118240?redirectedFrom=midshipman |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The word derives from an area aboard a ship, [[amidships]], but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship,<ref name=\"Penn34\"/> or the location where midshipmen were [[Berth (sleeping)|berthed]].<ref name=\"dictionary\">{{Harvnb|Morris|Kearns|1998|p=186}}</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, four types of midshipman existed: midshipman (original rating), [[midshipman extraordinary]], midshipman (apprentice officer), and [[midshipman ordinary]].<ref name=lewis217>{{Harvnb|Lewis|1939|pp=217\u2013220}}</ref> Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, some members of the original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission.<ref name=\"Penn8\">{{Harvnb|Penn|1957|p=8}}</ref> By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.<ref name=\"Words\">{{Harvnb|King|2001|p=299}}</ref>\n\n=====Entry=====\n[[File:Henry William Baynton by Thomas Hickey.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|Midshipman Henry William Baynton aged 13 (1780)]]\nBeginning in 1661, boys who aspired to become officers were sent by their families to serve on ships with a \"letter of service\" from the crown, and were paid at the same rate as midshipmen.<ref name=\"Davies16\">{{Harvnb|Davies|1991|p=16}}</ref> The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown \"such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman, both in accommodating him in your ship and in furthering his improvement\".<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Midshipman|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|edition=11th|volume=XVIII|page=423|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|location=New York|year=1911|editor-last=Chisholm|editor-first=Hugh|editor-link=Hugh Chisholm|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FEEAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN11027773&pg=PA423#v=onepage&q=Midshipman&f=false|accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref> Their official rating was [[volunteer-per-order]], but they were often known as King's letter boys, to distinguish their higher social class from the original midshipman rating.<ref name=\"Davies16\"/><ref name=\"Penn1011\">{{Harvnb|Penn|1957|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1677, Royal Navy regulations for promotion to lieutenant required service as a midshipman, and promotion to midshipman required some time at sea.<ref name=\"Lewis221\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1939|p=221}}</ref> By the Napoleonic era, the regulations required at least three years of services as a midshipman or [[master's mate]] and six years of total sea time.<ref name=\"lavery89\"/> Sea time was earned in various ways, most boys served this period at sea in any lower rating,<ref name=\"band\"/> either as a servant of one of the ship's officers, a volunteer, or a seaman.<ref name=\"lavery89\"/>\n\nBy the 1730s, the rating volunteer-per-order was phased out and replaced with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers.

The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the [[peerage]] and [[landed gentry]] formed the next largest group, about 27&nbsp;percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, and they had a considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later [[William IV of the United Kingdom#Early life|William IV]], who served as a midshipman from 1780 to 1785. The rest were from commercial or [[working class]] backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.<ref name=\"lavery90\"/>\n\nSince most midshipmen were from the gentry or had family connections with sailing ships, many used their connections to have their names placed on a ship's books. The practice, known colloquially as \"false muster\" was common even though it was technically illegal and frowned upon.<ref name=oedfalsemuster>{{cite web | title=false muster, n. | work=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/67884#eid4709865|accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref> This allowed some boys to be promoted to midshipmen, or in some cases lieutenant, without having completed the required amount of time at sea.

They were expected to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|gun batteries]], commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a [[passed midshipman]], who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a [[schoolmaster]], who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the [[chaplain]]. Midshipmen were expected to keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.<ref name=\"lavery90\"/>\n\n[[Image:NormalEntryCommissionRoute.png|thumb|left|350px|alt=From bottom to top, a boy would enter the Navy either at the Royal Naval Academy, or directly as a Volunteer 1st class, and serve at least three years before promotion to midshipman. A potential officer would have to serve as a midshipman, or a master's mate prior to taking the examination for lieutenant for another three years. A midshipman who passed the examination was not automatically promoted to lieutenant, but would either stay as a midshipman, titled passed midshipman, or take an appointment as a master's mate, styled passed master's mate while awaiting promotion to lieutenant. Failed candidates also took appointments as master's mates, attempting to become masters instead of lieutenants. After 1861, candidates who passed the examination were promoted to sub-lieutenant.|Route to a commission in the Royal Navy, c. 1810<ref name=\"lavery92\">{{Harvnb|Lavery|1989|p=92}}</ref>]]\nPrior to promotion to lieutenant, a commissioned officer candidate in the Royal Navy had to pass a formal examination. Officially, a prospective lieutenant was at least 19 and was expected to produce proof of his service, which would include certificates from his commanders and journals kept while a midshipman.<ref name=\"nelson93\"/>  However, most midshipmen aspired to take the [[Lieutenant (U.S. Navy)|lieutenant]] examination at age 17 or 18, and the typical age of a midshipman was between 15 and 22.<ref name=\"band\">{{Harvnb|Phillipson|1996|p=2}}</ref>  The candidate was summoned before a board of three captains and questioned about [[seamanship]], [[navigation]], and [[discipline]]. The board would ask questions such as: <blockquote>\nAn enemy is observed; give orders for clearing your ship, and make all the necessary preparations for engaging.<ref name=\"nelson93\"/></blockquote>\n\nLike the board, which might be an ''ad hoc'' affair, the actual exam questions were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate was expected to be able to [[Rope splicing|splice ropes]], [[Reefing|reef a sail]], [[Sailing|work a ship in sailing]] and [[shift his tides]]. In navigation, he was expected to be able to keep a reckoning of the ship's way by [[plane sailing]], to use [[Mercator projection]] maps and [[Navigation#Celestial navigation|observation of the sun and stars]] to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the [[Magnetic declination|variation of the compass]]. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an [[able seaman]] and midshipman.<ref name=\"nelson93\"/>\n\nFailure usually meant six more months of sea service before the examination could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'.<ref name=\"nelson93\">{{Harvnb|Lavery|1989|p=93}}</ref> From the 18th century until the second half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime, the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.<ref name=\"YG185\">{{Harvnb|Walker|1938|p=185}}</ref>\n\nPassed midshipmen awaiting promotion often elected to become master's mates, a high-ranking petty officer who assisted the [[Master (naval)|master]] with his duties, served on watch as deputy to the lieutenants, and commanded small boats.<ref name=\"officerranks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm#Slt |title=Officer ranks in the Royal Navy |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |accessdate=25 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015812/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm |archivedate=11 October 2014 }}</ref> A midshipman who became master's mate earned an increase in pay from \u00a32&nbsp;5s to \u00a33&nbsp;16s per month but initially reduced his chances at a commission because master's mates, along with masters, were assumed to have a working-class background.<ref name=\"YG186\"/><ref name=\"Lewis146\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1960|p=146,197}}</ref>.

Commonwealth countries which use the rank include [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canada]] (Naval Cadet), [[Royal Australian Navy|Australia]], [[Bangladesh Navy|Bangladesh]], [[Namibian Navy|Namibia]], [[Royal New Zealand Navy|New Zealand]], [[South African Navy|South Africa]], [[Indian Navy|India]], [[Pakistan Navy|Pakistan]], [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Singapore]], [[Sri Lanka Navy|Sri Lanka]], and [[Kenya Navy|Kenya]]. \n\nIn the 17th century, a midshipman was a [[Naval rating|rating]] for an experienced seaman, and the word derives from the area aboard a ship, [[amidships]], either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was [[Berth (sleeping)|berthed]]. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the [[Napoleonic era]] (1793\u20131815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served at least three years as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day [[petty officer]] in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or [[master's mate]], he was eligible to take the examination for [[lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]]. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipmen in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a [[warrant officer]] rank until 1912.\n\nDuring the 19th century, changes in the training of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a [[Military academy|naval college]]. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time at sea declined to less than a year as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.\n\nRanks equivalent to midshipman exist in many other navies. Using US midshipman or pre-fleet board UK midshipman as the basis for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer. Using post-fleet board UK midshipman for comparison, the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure, and similar to a US ensign in role and responsibility. In many [[Romance language]]s, the literal translation of the local term for \"midshipman\" into English is \"Navy Guard\", including the French ''garde marine'', Spanish ''guardia marina'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''guarda-marinha'', and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''guardiamarina''. Today, these ranks all refer to naval cadets, but historically they were selected by the monarchy, and were trained mostly on land as soldiers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Apprentice officers===\n\n====Royal Navy (1662\u20131836)====\n\n=====Origins=====\n[[Image:Thomas Rowlandson-midship.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A full size portrait of a boy with long golden hair wearing the uniform of a midshipman: a bicorne hat, a blue tails coat with white patches on the collar, a white waistcoat, breeches and hose, and a sword on the left side|Midshipman of the [[Royal Navy]] (''c''. 1799),<ref name=NMMImage>{{cite web |url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConGallery.57/Ranksin-Nelsons-navy.html |title= Ranks in Nelson's Navy|accessdate=20 February 2009|work=Port Cities London |publisher=National Maritime Museum}}</ref> by [[Thomas Rowlandson]]]]\nThe rank of midshipman originated during the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period (England)|Stuart]] eras, and originally referred to a post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the [[Main-mast|main]] and [[mizzen mast|mizzen]] masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training.<ref name=\"Penn34\">{{Harvnb|Penn|1957|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> The first published use of the term midshipman was in 1662.<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite web | title=midshipman, n. | work=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118240?redirectedFrom=midshipman |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The word derives from an area aboard a ship, [[amidships]], but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship,<ref name=\"Penn34\"/> or the location where midshipmen were [[Berth (sleeping)|berthed]].<ref name=\"dictionary\">{{Harvnb|Morris|Kearns|1998|p=186}}</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, four types of midshipman existed: midshipman (original rating), [[midshipman extraordinary]], midshipman (apprentice officer), and [[midshipman ordinary]].<ref name=lewis217>{{Harvnb|Lewis|1939|pp=217\u2013220}}</ref> Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, some members of the original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission.<ref name=\"Penn8\">{{Harvnb|Penn|1957|p=8}}</ref> By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.<ref name=\"Words\">{{Harvnb|King|2001|p=299}}</ref>\n\n=====Entry=====\n[[File:Henry William Baynton by Thomas Hickey.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|Midshipman Henry William Baynton aged 13 (1780)]]\nBeginning in 1661, boys who aspired to become officers were sent by their families to serve on ships with a \"letter of service\" from the crown, and were paid at the same rate as midshipmen.<ref name=\"Davies16\">{{Harvnb|Davies|1991|p=16}}</ref> The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown \"such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman, both in accommodating him in your ship and in furthering his improvement\".<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Midshipman|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|edition=11th|volume=XVIII|page=423|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|location=New York|year=1911|editor-last=Chisholm|editor-first=Hugh|editor-link=Hugh Chisholm|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FEEAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN11027773&pg=PA423#v=onepage&q=Midshipman&f=false|accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref> Their official rating was [[volunteer-per-order]], but they were often known as King's letter boys, to distinguish their higher social class from the original midshipman rating.<ref name=\"Davies16\"/><ref name=\"Penn1011\">{{Harvnb|Penn|1957|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1677, Royal Navy regulations for promotion to lieutenant required service as a midshipman, and promotion to midshipman required some time at sea.<ref name=\"Lewis221\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1939|p=221}}</ref> By the Napoleonic era, the regulations required at least three years of services as a midshipman or [[master's mate]] and six years of total sea time.<ref name=\"lavery89\"/> Sea time was earned in various ways, most boys served this period at sea in any lower rating,<ref name=\"band\"/> either as a servant of one of the ship's officers, a volunteer, or a seaman.<ref name=\"lavery89\"/>\n\nBy the 1730s, the rating volunteer-per-order was phased out and replaced with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers.

The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the [[peerage]] and [[landed gentry]] formed the next largest group, about 27&nbsp;percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, and they had a considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later [[William IV of the United Kingdom#Early life|William IV]], who served as a midshipman from 1780 to 1785. The rest were from commercial or [[working class]] backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.<ref name=\"lavery90\"/>\n\nSince most midshipmen were from the gentry or had family connections with sailing ships, many used their connections to have their names placed on a ship's books. The practice, known colloquially as \"false muster\" was common even though it was technically illegal and frowned upon.<ref name=oedfalsemuster>{{cite web | title=false muster, n. | work=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/67884#eid4709865|accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref> This allowed some boys to be promoted to midshipmen, or in some cases lieutenant, without having completed the required amount of time at sea.

They were expected to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|gun batteries]], commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a [[passed midshipman]], who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a [[schoolmaster]], who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the [[chaplain]]. Midshipmen were expected to keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.<ref name=\"lavery90\"/>\n\n[[Image:NormalEntryCommissionRoute.png|thumb|left|350px|alt=From bottom to top, a boy would enter the Navy either at the Royal Naval Academy, or directly as a Volunteer 1st class, and serve at least three years before promotion to midshipman. A potential officer would have to serve as a midshipman, or a master's mate prior to taking the examination for lieutenant for another three years. A midshipman who passed the examination was not automatically promoted to lieutenant, but would either stay as a midshipman, titled passed midshipman, or take an appointment as a master's mate, styled passed master's mate, while awaiting promotion to lieutenant. Failed candidates also took appointments as master's mates, attempting to become masters instead of lieutenants. After 1861, candidates who passed the examination were promoted to sub-lieutenant.|Route to a commission in the Royal Navy, c. 1810<ref name=\"lavery92\">{{Harvnb|Lavery|1989|p=92}}</ref>]]\nPrior to promotion to lieutenant, a commissioned officer candidate in the Royal Navy had to pass a formal examination. Officially, a prospective lieutenant was at least 19, and was expected to produce proof of his service, which would include certificates from his commanders and journals kept while a midshipman.<ref name=\"nelson93\"/>  However, most midshipmen aspired to take the [[Lieutenant (U.S. Navy)|lieutenant]] examination at age 17 or 18, and the typical age of a midshipman was between 15 and 22.<ref name=\"band\">{{Harvnb|Phillipson|1996|p=2}}</ref>  The candidate was summoned before a board of three captains and questioned about [[seamanship]], [[navigation]], and [[discipline]]. The board would ask questions such as: <blockquote>\nAn enemy is observed; give orders for clearing your ship, and make all the necessary preparations for engaging.<ref name=\"nelson93\"/></blockquote>\n\nLike the board, which might be an ''ad hoc'' affair, the actual exam questions were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate was expected to be able to [[Rope splicing|splice ropes]], [[Reefing|reef a sail]], [[Sailing|work a ship in sailing]] and [[shift his tides]]. In navigation, he was expected to be able to keep a reckoning of the ship's way by [[plane sailing]], to use [[Mercator projection]] maps and [[Navigation#Celestial navigation|observation of the sun and stars]] to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the [[Magnetic declination|variation of the compass]]. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an [[able seaman]] and midshipman.<ref name=\"nelson93\"/>\n\nFailure usually meant six more months of sea service before the examination could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'.<ref name=\"nelson93\">{{Harvnb|Lavery|1989|p=93}}</ref> From the 18th century until the second half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission.

During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.<ref name=\"YG185\">{{Harvnb|Walker|1938|p=185}}</ref>\n\nPassed midshipmen awaiting promotion often elected to become master's mates, a high-ranking petty officer who assisted the [[Master (naval)|master]] with his duties, served on watch as deputy to the lieutenants, and commanded small boats.<ref name=\"officerranks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm#Slt |title=Officer ranks in the Royal Navy |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |accessdate=25 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015812/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm |archivedate=11 October 2014 }}</ref> A midshipman who became master's mate earned an increase in pay from \u00a32&nbsp;5s to \u00a33&nbsp;16s per month but initially reduced his chances at a commission because master's mates, along with masters, were assumed to have a working-class background.<ref name=\"YG186\"/><ref name=\"Lewis146\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1960|p=146,197}}</ref>  Over time, however, appointment to master's mate became considered a normal part of the path to a commission; the situation caused some confusion during the last part of the 18th century, when two parallel roles&nbsp;\u2013 master's mates trying to become masters, and former midshipmen working toward a commission&nbsp;\u2013 held the same title and responsibilities aboard ship.<ref name=\"seaofficers\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1939|p=212,230}}</ref>\n\nBy the first years of the 19th century, the term 'mate', without the prefix master's, was used for [[passed midshipman|passed midshipmen]], to distinguish them from master's mates who had not served as midshipmen.
