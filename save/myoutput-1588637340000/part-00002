Convincing him to join the group to keep him close and safe, she later assists him in saving the Planet from the game's villain, [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]. Installments in ''The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' later expanded upon her character, such as in the film ''Advent Children'', where she attempts to convince Cloud to let go of his self-imposed [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and move on with his life after Sephiroth's defeat.\n\nNamed the [[pin-up girl]] of the \"cyber generation\" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Tifa has been compared to [[Lara Croft]] as an example of a strong, independent and attractive female character in video games. Media have repeatedly praised both the character's strength and appearance and described her as one of the best female characters in gaming.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''Final Fantasy VII''===\nIntroduced in ''Final Fantasy VII'', Tifa is the childhood friend of Cloud Strife, and owner of the 7th Heaven bar, as well as a member of the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE, who oppose the [[megacorporation]] [[Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra]] and their use of [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Mako|Mako]] energy as a power source. She convinces Cloud to join the group to keep a closer eye on him after noticing his personality has changed, and she follows him in pursuit of the game's antagonist, [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]. Unable to keep him from being manipulated by Sephiroth, she helps him recover after his mind becomes fractured, and they realise their mutual feelings for one another, working together to defeat Sephiroth.<ref name=\"42-47\"/>\n\nIn [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], it is revealed that as children Tifa and Cloud had decided to follow a path to a mountain near their hometown of Nibelheim. However, they were both injured and Tifa was in a [[coma]] for a week, with her father holding Cloud responsible for the incident.<ref name=\"egm\"/> Cloud eventually left to join Shinra's [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Departments|SOLDIER]] program in order to become stronger, but it is later revealed that he did it primarily to attract her attention.<ref name=\"cloud\">{{cite video game |publisher=Sony |developer=Square |platform=PlayStation |date=1997-09-07 |title=Final Fantasy VII |quote='''Tifa:''' 'Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place.' ... / '''Cloud:''' '......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed.

Surviving the incident, Tifa was taken to safety by her martial arts instructor [[Zangan (Final Fantasy VII)|Zangan]], eventually arriving in Midgar and meeting AVALANCHE's leader, [[Barret Wallace]]. Upon recovering, she joined AVALANCHE so as to get revenge for the destruction of her home. She eventually encountered an incoherent Cloud at the city's train station, and convinced him to work for Barret, so as to keep him close and safe.<ref>{{cite video game |publisher=Sony |developer=Square |platform=PlayStation |date=1997-09-07 |title=Final Fantasy VII |quote='''Tifa:''' '...it's really been a long time.

In it, she tries to give emotional support to Cloud, urging him to come to terms with the unwarranted guilt he places upon himself. In addition, she takes care of Barret Wallace's adopted daughter [[Marlene Wallace|Marlene]] and another child, [[Denzel (Final Fantasy VII)|Denzel]]. During the film, she fights against one of the antagonists, [[Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo|Loz]], and later she helps battle the summoned creature Bahamut SIN.
