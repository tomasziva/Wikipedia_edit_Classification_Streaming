Sand Island and the two Home Islets in the west and Barren Island in the east are not. The largest island is Cooper Island in the north, followed by Kaula Island in the south. The northern arch of islets is formed by Strawn Island, Cooper Island (or Cooper-Meng Island since former Cooper and Meng Islands were joined in 1940), Aviation Island, Quail Island, Whippoorwill Island, followed in the east by Eastern Island, Papala Island and Pelican Island, and in the south by Bird Island, Holei Island, Engineer Island, Tanager Island, Marine Island, Kaula Island, Paradise Island, the Home Islets and Sand Island (clockwise).\n\nPalmyra Atoll is in the [[Samoa Time Zone]] (UTC\u221211:00), the same [[time zone]] as [[American Samoa]], [[Midway Atoll]], [[Kingman Reef]] and [[Jarvis Island]].\n\n=== Incorporated in the United States ===\nIn [[Insular Cases|''The Insular Cases'']], the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held [[Incorporated territory#Incorporated and unincorporated territories|incorporated territories]] to be integral parts of the United States, as opposed to [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territories]] being merely possessions. The incorporated ''United States Territory of Palmyra Island'' has the [[List of countries by southernmost point|southernmost point]] of the incorporated United States of America, with its southernmost shore at 5\u00b052'15\" N [[latitude]].

Temperatures average {{convert|85|\u00b0F}} year round.

However, since Palmyra is also an [[unorganized territory]], there is no [[U.S. Congress|Act of Congress]] specifying how Palmyra should be governed. Palmyra has no permanent residents; however, in 2004 accommodations were built to support a small number of temporary inhabitants.\n\nThe only relevant [[U.S. Government|federal law]] simply gives the [[President of the United States|president]] the authority to administer Palmyra as directed, or via the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii]] (Hawaii Omnibus Act, Pub.

Thus crippled, it was attacked and boarded by [[pirates]], who loaded the treasure and surviving crew onto their own ship.  The ''Esperanza'' sank, and they sailed west across the Pacific bound for [[Macao]].\n\nAfter 43 days, the pirates' ship met a storm, lost course, and struck hard the [[coral reef]] surrounding Palmyra Island, breaking the mast. The ninety men aboard were able to pull the ship in closer to land but it was not serviceable.  They offloaded the treasure to the island, distributed some, and buried the rest.  They repaired part of their boat and most of the crew shipped away.  They were not heard from again. The remaining ten men spent most of a year on Palmyra living off of dwindling stores and local food.  They spent three months building a small escape boat, and six men left Palmyra on the boat.  Of these, four were washed overboard in a storm and the other two were rescued by an American [[whaler]] bound for [[San Francisco]]. One died en route, and the survivor, James Hines, was put in a hospital; 30 days later he died.\n\nBefore he died, he wrote letters describing the affair and the location of the treasure, which originally included 1.5 million Spanish pesos of gold and an equal value in silver (possibly consisting of [[Pre-Columbian era|precolumbian]] artworks).  In around 1903, over 95 years later, the letters were allegedly deposited for safekeeping with Capt. William R. Foster, the [[harbormaster]] of [[Honolulu]], by a sailor who was bound for the [[Solomon Islands]] but never returned.  After holding the letters for 20 years in an iron chest, Capt. Foster revealed them to a reporter who published the details.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://palmyraarchive.org/items/show/75|title=Priceless Treasures of the Incas May Be Buried on Island in Palmyras|last=Connor|first=Martin|date=April 14, 1923|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|access-date=August 14, 2017|location=Honolulu|page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814140953/http://palmyraarchive.org/items/show/75|archive-date=August 14, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Palmyra landowner [[Henry E.

This marked the first visit to Palmyra of a scientific expedition, and various live samples were collected of the native plants and animals.  In his 23rd volume recording the findings of the [[United States Exploring Expedition|USXX]], Wilkes wrote of Palmyra:\n\n<blockquote>This island is inhabited...It is to be regretted that all these detached islands should not be visited by our national vessels, and friendly intercourse kept up with them.

The detachment remained at these islands two days and they were perfect for flying, affording an opportunity to take wonderful aerial pictures. The commanding officer and the aviators made a number of flights and the official photographer was in his element.</blockquote>\n\nAt the time, Palmyra was occupied by three Americans, two of whom were married.  While there, the U.S.S.

They established the Palmyra Copra Company to harvest the [[coconut]]s growing on the atoll.

The case went all the way up to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].  The previously mentioned Insular Areas report goes on to state, \"While the suit was pending during World War II, the Navy occupied Palmyra and built a runway and several buildings.\"  The Fullard-Leos and Coopers finally won their case in ''United States v. Fullard-Leo et al.'', 331 U.S. 256 (1947), which quieted good land title ''against'' the federal government in favor of private landowners.

The proclamation established \"Palmyra Island Naval Defensive Sea Area\" which encompassed the territorial waters between the extreme high-water marks and the three-mile marine boundaries surrounding the atoll. \"Palmyra Island Naval Airspace Reservation\" was also established to restrict access to the airspace over the naval defense sea area. Only U.S. government ships and aircraft were permitted to enter the naval defense areas at Palmyra Atoll unless authorized by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|secretary of the navy]].\n\nThe Navy took over the atoll for use as the [[Palmyra Atoll Airfield|Palmyra Island Naval Air Station]] on August 15, 1941. From November 1939 through 1947, the atoll had resident Federal Government representatives, the island commanders.  The atoll was [[Shelling of Johnston and Palmyra|shelled by a Japanese submarine]] in 1941, with no significant damage or injuries.  The government made extensive alterations to the land forms.  It blasted and dredged a ship channel from the open sea into the West Lagoon, which had been completely enclosed by islands and reef and was non-navigable until the channel reached the lagoon on May 15, 1941.  It joined islands with causeway roads, built new islands and extended existing islands with dredged coral spoil, including the main runway on Cooper Island, an emergency landing strip called Sand Island joined by a causeway to Home Island, and two artificial runway islands that were not completed.  These alterations blocked the water flow through the atoll and are believed to have severely harmed the natural ecology of the lagoons.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Shoreline Changes and Sediment Redistribution at Palmyra Atoll (Equatorial Pacific Ocean): 1874\u2013Present |last1=Collen |first1=J.

Walker and Stearns were arrested in Arizona for murder, and Walker was convicted in 1985.

In 2003, a scientific study was published about fossilized coral that was washing up on Palmyra. This fossilized coral was examined for evidence of the behavior of the effect of [[El Ni\u00f1o]] on the tropical [[Pacific Ocean]] over the past 1,000 years.<ref>K. M.

Subsequently, the Department of the Interior published a regulation providing for the management of the refuge. 66 Fed. Reg. 7660-01 (January 24, 2001). The pertinent part of the regulation states as follows:\n\n<blockquote>We will close the refuge to [[commercial fishing]] but will permit a low level of compatible recreational fishing for bonefishing and deep water sportfishing under programs that we will carefully manage to ensure compatibility with refuge purposes. . . . Management actions will include protection of the refuge waters and wildlife from commercial fishing activities.</blockquote>\n\nIn March 2003, [[The Nature Conservancy]] conveyed {{convert|416|acre|km2}} of the emergent land of Palmyra to the United States to be included in the refuge. In 2005, it subsequently added 28 more acres to the conveyance. [[The Nature Conservancy]] and [[Henry Ernest Cooper]]'s descendants kept their remaining private land tracts at Palmyra.\n\n[[File:Coral reef at palmyra.jpg|thumb|350px|Coral reef at Palmyra NWR]]\nThe conveyance of Palmyra land to [[The Nature Conservancy|The Nature Conservancy, Inc.]] from the Fullard-Leos in 2000 was subject to a preexisting commercial fishing licence.  Then in 2001 the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|secretary of the interior]] banned commercial fishing near Palmyra but allowed sport fishing, as quoted above.  In January 2007, the commercial fishing licensees sued the United States in the [[Court of Federal Claims]] alleging that, under the [[Takings Clause#Eminent domain|Takings Clause]], the Interior Department regulation had \"directly confiscated, taken, and rendered wholly and completely worthless\" their purported property interests.  The United States filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and the court granted the motion.<ref>{{Cite court |litigants = Palmyra Pacific Seafoods, L.L.C. v. United States  |vol = 80  |reporter = Fed.

In 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, [[The Nature Conservancy]], and [[Island Conservation]] began an extensive program to eradicate the large population of non-native rats that had arrived on Palmyra during World War II. As many as 30,000 rats once roamed the atoll, eating the eggs of native seabirds and destroying the seedlings of one of the largest remaining stands of ''[[Pisonia grandis]]'' trees in the Pacific. These efforts were successfully concluded in 2012 with respect to rodent removal; however, fifty-one animal samples representing 15 species of birds, fish, reptiles and invertebrates were collected for residue analysis during systematic searches or as nontarget mortalities.

However, there is no easy way to visit Palmyra Atoll, and so very few visit.<ref name=\"visiting\"/> Visits must have prior approval.<ref name=\"visiting\"/> The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] says the following:\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\"Public access to Palmyra Atoll is self-limiting due to the very high expense of traveling to such a remote destination. [[The Nature Conservancy]] owns and operates the only airplane runway on Palmyra, and by boat it's a 5\u20137 day sailing trip from [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]]. There are four ways the public may gain access to the refuge: (1) Working for, contracting with, or volunteering for The Nature Conservancy or Fish and Wildlife Service; (2) Conducting scientific research via Fish and Wildlife Service Special Use Permits; (3) Invitation through The Nature Conservancy sponsored donor trip; (4) Visitation by private recreational sailboat or motorboat.\"<ref name=\"visiting\"/></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n=== Amateur radio (\"DX\") visitors ===\nSince the 1940s, Palmyra's most consistent visitors have been members of [[DXpedition|distance expedition]] (\"[[DXing#Amateur radio DX|DX]]\") teams, as the atoll is a popular spot for these [[amateur radio]] operators.  To date, more than 25 expeditions have been carried out.  Once on the islands, the hams broadcast various signals, attempting to reach as many recipients as possible.  Each recipient is eligible to receive a QSL card as confirmation of the connection. Former N. California [[DXing#DX Clubs|DX Club]] president Richard Malcolm Crouch became a Palmyra landowner.<ref>''Palmyra Island Land Recordation'' Document No. 93, U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, Honolulu, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe visits are often benign, but have occasionally included a bit of drama.  For instance, the June 1974 team helped rescue a couple whose ship had run aground on the reefs around Palmyra.  The man, Buck Walker, would later be convicted of homicide in the much publicized [[And the Sea Will Tell|''Sea Wind'' murder case]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palmyraarchive.org/admin/items/show/50|title=Interview with ham operator Rusty Epps}}{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref>  Two members of the 1980 team were injured severely enough on the atoll to need an airlift back to [[Honolulu]].  The first incident resulted from injuries sustained in a plane crash as their aircraft underestimated wind conditions on the atoll and the poor state of the landing strip.  The second injury, to a surgeon, happened when he fell and cut his hands on broken glass.  The surgeon then sued the owners of Palmyra, as he was no longer able to practice surgery, and the atoll was closed to visitors for most of the 1980s while cleanup activities were undertaken.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.palmyraarchive.org/items/show/67|accessdate=March 30, 2018|title=The Perils of Palmyra|date=January 1984|magazine=Honolulu Magazine|author=Betty Fullard-Leo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104319/http://www.palmyraarchive.org/items/show/67|archive-date=March 31, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Guano Island claims]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Vincent Bugliosi]] and [[Bruce B.

The northern arch of islets is formed by Strawn Island, Cooper Island (or Cooper-Meng Island since former Cooper and Meng Islands were joined in 1940), Aviation Island, Quail Island, Whippoorwill Island, followed in the east by Eastern Island, Papala Island and Pelican Island, and in the south by Bird Island, Holei Island, Engineer Island, Tanager Island, Marine Island, Kaula Island, Paradise Island, the Home Islets and Sand Island (clockwise).\n\nPalmyra Atoll is in the [[Samoa Time Zone]] (UTC\u221211:00), the same [[time zone]] as [[American Samoa]], [[Midway Atoll]], [[Kingman Reef]] and [[Jarvis Island]].\n\n=== Incorporated in the United States ===\nIn [[Insular Cases|''The Insular Cases'']], the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held [[Incorporated territory#Incorporated and unincorporated territories|incorporated territories]] to be integral parts of the United States, as opposed to [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territories]] being merely possessions. The incorporated ''United States Territory of Palmyra Island'' has the [[List of countries by southernmost point|southernmost point]] of the incorporated United States of America, with its southernmost shore at 5\u00b052'15\" N [[latitude]]. U.S.-controlled territories such as [[American Samoa]] (and the southernmost place, [[Rose Atoll]]) are farther south, but they are not incorporated territories of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/MNM/mnm_roseatoll.html |title=Rose Atoll Marine National Monument |website=Noaa.gov |accessdate=30 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117183245/http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/MNM/mnm_roseatoll.html |archive-date=2018-01-17 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/American-Samoa |contribution=American Samoa |website=Britannica.com |accessdate= 30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\nAverage annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|175|in|abbr=on}} per year.

However, since Palmyra is also an [[unorganized territory]], there is no [[U.S. Congress|Act of Congress]] specifying how Palmyra should be governed. Palmyra has no permanent residents; however, in 2004 accommodations were built to support a small number of temporary inhabitants.\n\nThe only relevant [[U.S. Government|federal law]] simply gives the [[President of the United States|president]] the authority to administer Palmyra as directed, or via the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii]] (Hawaii Omnibus Act, Pub.

Thus crippled, it was attacked and boarded by [[pirates]], who loaded the treasure and surviving crew onto their own ship.  The ''Esperanza'' sank, and they sailed west across the Pacific bound for [[Macao]].\n\nAfter 43 days, the pirates' ship met a storm, lost course, and struck hard the [[coral reef]] surrounding Palmyra Island, breaking the mast. The ninety men aboard were able to pull the ship in closer to land but it was not serviceable.  They offloaded the treasure to the island, distributed some, and buried the rest.  They repaired part of their boat and most of the crew shipped away.  They were not heard from again. The remaining ten men spent most of a year on Palmyra living off of dwindling stores and local food.  They spent three months building a small escape boat, and six men left Palmyra on the boat.  Of these, four were washed overboard in a storm and the other two were rescued by an American [[whaler]] bound for [[San Francisco]]. One died en route, and the survivor, James Hines, was put in a hospital; 30 days later he died.\n\nBefore he died, he wrote letters describing the affair and the location of the treasure, which originally included 1.5 million Spanish pesos of gold and an equal value in silver (possibly consisting of [[Pre-Columbian era|precolumbian]] artworks).  In around 1903, over 95 years later, the letters were allegedly deposited for safekeeping with Capt. William R. Foster, the [[harbormaster]] of [[Honolulu]], by a sailor who was bound for the [[Solomon Islands]] but never returned.  After holding the letters for 20 years in an iron chest, Capt.

The events of that trip were recorded by a naval [[Pharmacist Mate]], M. L. Steele, who wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During our visit the weather was delightful. The detachment remained at these islands two days and they were perfect for flying, affording an opportunity to take wonderful aerial pictures. The commanding officer and the aviators made a number of flights and the official photographer was in his element.</blockquote>\n\nAt the time, Palmyra was occupied by three Americans, two of whom were married.  While there, the U.S.S. ''Eagle'' 40, which had transported the aircraft and photographic equipment to the islands, made a very rare exception to naval regulation and took aboard the wife, Mrs. Meng, to return her to [[Honolulu]] for medical aid as she was not handling the isolation and trying physical conditions of Palmyra well.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Palmyra Islands|publisher=Hospital Corps Quarterly|author=M.L.

During negotiations, the government filed a [[quiet title]] action against the Fullard-Leos and [[Henry Ernest Cooper]]'s six surviving children, claiming that there had never been any private property at Palmyra under the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] or later.  The case went all the way up to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].  The previously mentioned Insular Areas report goes on to state, \"While the suit was pending during World War II, the Navy occupied Palmyra and built a runway and several buildings.\"  The Fullard-Leos and Coopers finally won their case in ''United States v.

The proclamation established \"Palmyra Island Naval Defensive Sea Area\" which encompassed the territorial waters between the extreme high-water marks and the three-mile marine boundaries surrounding the atoll. \"Palmyra Island Naval Airspace Reservation\" was also established to restrict access to the airspace over the naval defense sea area. Only U.S. government ships and aircraft were permitted to enter the naval defense areas at Palmyra Atoll unless authorized by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|secretary of the navy]].\n\nThe Navy took over the atoll for use as the [[Palmyra Atoll Airfield|Palmyra Island Naval Air Station]] on August 15, 1941. From November 1939 through 1947, the atoll had resident Federal Government representatives, the island commanders.  The atoll was [[Shelling of Johnston and Palmyra|shelled by a Japanese submarine]] in 1941, with no significant damage or injuries.  The government made extensive alterations to the land forms.  It blasted and dredged a ship channel from the open sea into the West Lagoon, which had been completely enclosed by islands and reef and was non-navigable until the channel reached the lagoon on May 15, 1941.  It joined islands with causeway roads, built new islands and extended existing islands with dredged coral spoil, including the main runway on Cooper Island, an emergency landing strip called Sand Island joined by a causeway to Home Island, and two artificial runway islands that were not completed.  These alterations blocked the water flow through the atoll and are believed to have severely harmed the natural ecology of the lagoons.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Shoreline Changes and Sediment Redistribution at Palmyra Atoll (Equatorial Pacific Ocean): 1874\u2013Present |last1=Collen |first1=J.

The book led to a CBS television miniseries of the same name, starring [[James Brolin]], [[Rachel Ward]], [[Deidre Hall]], and [[Hart Bochner]]; [[Richard Crenna]] played lawyer [[Vincent Bugliosi|Bugliosi]]. The story was also depicted in ''[[The FBI Files]]''.\n\nWalker and Stearns were arrested in Honolulu in 1974 after returning from Palmyra aboard ''Sea Wind'', the yacht stolen from the Grahams. Because no bodies were found at the time, Walker and Stearns were convicted only for the theft of the yacht. Six years later, a partially-buried, corroded chest was found in a lagoon at Palmyra, containing Eleanor Graham's remains. Walker and Stearns were arrested in Arizona for murder, and Walker was convicted in 1985. Stearns was acquitted in 1986 after her defense argued that Walker had committed the murders without Stearns's knowledge. Because no body or any other evidence of Malcolm Graham's death has been discovered, his murder has never been formally alleged.\n\nWalker served 22&nbsp;years in the [[United States Penitentiary, Victorville]], California before receiving parole in 2007.

Other trees provide habitat for 11 seabird species, and the conservancy writes that their re-establishment across the atoll will encourage coral growth and may lessen the local impact of a rise in sea-level. As of December 2019, half a million coconut sprouts had been removed, and tracking begun of the ecosystem's response.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tnc-hawaii-plan.squarespace.com/palmyra-resilience |title=Palmyra Resilience|date=December 2019|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|access-date=April 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nPalmyra Atoll's location in the Pacific Ocean, where the southern and northern currents meet, results in its beaches becoming littered with trash and debris. Plastic mooring [[buoy]]s and plastic bottles are plentiful on the beaches of Palmyra.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/on-assignment/assignment-paradise-lost-found-n572216 |title=On Assignment: The Last Best Place On Earth |first=Harry |last=Smith |date=May 12, 2016 |format=Video |work=Dateline NBC |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=2018-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourists are allowed to visit Palmyra Atoll.<ref name=\"visiting\"/> (This is in contrast to most of the [[U.S. Minor Outlying Islands]], which are mostly closed to the public.) However, there is no easy way to visit Palmyra Atoll, and so very few visit.<ref name=\"visiting\"/> Visits must have prior approval.<ref name=\"visiting\"/> The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] says the following:\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\"Public access to Palmyra Atoll is self-limiting due to the very high expense of traveling to such a remote destination. [[The Nature Conservancy]] owns and operates the only airplane runway on Palmyra, and by boat it's a 5\u20137 day sailing trip from [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]]. There are four ways the public may gain access to the refuge: (1) Working for, contracting with, or volunteering for The Nature Conservancy or Fish and Wildlife Service; (2) Conducting scientific research via Fish and Wildlife Service Special Use Permits; (3) Invitation through The Nature Conservancy sponsored donor trip; (4) Visitation by private recreational sailboat or motorboat.\"<ref name=\"visiting\"/></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n=== Amateur radio (\"DX\") visitors ===\nSince the 1940s, Palmyra's most consistent visitors have been members of [[DXpedition|distance expedition]] (\"[[DXing#Amateur radio DX|DX]]\") teams, as the atoll is a popular spot for these [[amateur radio]] operators.  To date, more than 25 expeditions have been carried out.  Once on the islands, the hams broadcast various signals, attempting to reach as many recipients as possible.  Each recipient is eligible to receive a QSL card as confirmation of the connection. Former N. California [[DXing#DX Clubs|DX Club]] president Richard Malcolm Crouch became a Palmyra landowner.<ref>''Palmyra Island Land Recordation'' Document No. 93, U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, Honolulu, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe visits are often benign, but have occasionally included a bit of drama.  For instance, the June 1974 team helped rescue a couple whose ship had run aground on the reefs around Palmyra.  The man, Buck Walker, would later be convicted of homicide in the much publicized [[And the Sea Will Tell|''Sea Wind'' murder case]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palmyraarchive.org/admin/items/show/50|title=Interview with ham operator Rusty Epps}}{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref>  Two members of the 1980 team were injured severely enough on the atoll to need an airlift back to [[Honolulu]].  The first incident resulted from injuries sustained in a plane crash as their aircraft underestimated wind conditions on the atoll and the poor state of the landing strip.  The second injury, to a surgeon, happened when he fell and cut his hands on broken glass.  The surgeon then sued the owners of Palmyra, as he was no longer able to practice surgery, and the atoll was closed to visitors for most of the 1980s while cleanup activities were undertaken.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.palmyraarchive.org/items/show/67|accessdate=March 30, 2018|title=The Perils of Palmyra|date=January 1984|magazine=Honolulu Magazine|author=Betty Fullard-Leo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104319/http://www.palmyraarchive.org/items/show/67|archive-date=March 31, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Guano Island claims]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Vincent Bugliosi]] and [[Bruce B.
