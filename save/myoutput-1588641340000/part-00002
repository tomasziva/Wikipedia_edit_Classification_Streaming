controlled by the PRC. It is instead controlled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]], a [[de-facto]] separate country.</ref> and makes up the majority of the province. The name of the island and the province, Hainan, means \"South of the Sea\", reflecting its position south of the [[Qiongzhou Strait]].\n\nThe province has an area of {{convert|33920|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, with Hainan Island making up {{Convert|32900|km2|mi2|-2|sp=us}} (97%) and the rest divided among 200 islands scattered across three archipelagos. It was administered as part of [[Guangdong]] from 1950 to 1988, when it became a separate province; around the same time, it was made the largest [[special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] established by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as part of the [[Chinese economic reform]].\n\nThe [[Li people]], a [[Kra\u2013Dai languages|Kra\u2013Dai]]-speaking [[ethnic group]], are native to the island and are a significant minority group in the province, comprising 15% of the population. Their native languages include the [[Hlai languages]]. They are recognized by the Chinese government as one of the country's 56 [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]]. The [[Han Chinese|Han]] population, who compose a majority of the population at 82%, speak a wide variety of languages including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Min Chinese|Min]] [[Hainanese]], [[Yue Chinese]], [[Be language|Lingaoese]] or [[Hakka Chinese]].<ref>Simons, Gary F.; Fennig, Charles D., eds.

The other major cities are [[Wenchang]], [[Qionghai]], [[Wanning]], [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]], [[Dongfang, Hainan|Dongfang]] and [[Danzhou]].\n\nAccording to China's [[Nine-Dash Line|territorial claims]] several territories in the [[South China Sea]], including the [[Spratly Islands]] (''Nansha'') and [[Paracel Islands]] (''Xisha''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349|title=Why is the South China Sea contentious? - BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-16}}</ref> are notionally administered as [[Sansha]] city of the province.\n{{anchor|Name|Etymology}}\n\n==Names==\nThe provincial name derives from its major island, Hainan, in Hainanese \"Hai Nam\", which is named after its position south of the [[Qiongzhou Strait]]. (To the north of the strait, the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] in Guangdong is also known as ''Haibei/Hai Bac'' or \"North of the Sea\".) Former names for Hainan Island include '''Zhuya''', '''Qiongya''', and '''Qiongzhou'''.

In 46 BC the Han court decided that the conquest was too expensive and abandoned the island. Around that time, Han Chinese people together with military personnel and officials began to migrate to Hainan Island from the mainland. Among them were the offspring of those who were banished to Hainan for political reasons. Most of them arrived in Hainan Island from the southern Chinese provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]] and [[Guangxi]].\n\n[[Li people]] (Hlai people) are the original [[Kra-Dai]] inhabitants of Hainan. They are believed to be the descendants of the ancient tribes from the mainland, who settled on the island between 7 and 27 thousand years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/46|title=Tracing the legacy of the early Hainan Islanders \u2013 a perspective from mitochondrial DNA|publisher=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=15 February 2011|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Li people mainly reside in the nine cities and counties in the middle and southern part of Hainan \u2013 the cities of Sanya, [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]] and Dongfang, the Li autonomous counties of [[Baisha Li Autonomous County|Baisha]], Lingshui, Ledong, [[Changjiang Li Autonomous County|Changjiang]], and the 'Li and Miao Autonomous Counties of [[Qiongzhong Li and Miao Autonomous County|Qiongzhong]] and [[Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County|Baoting]]'. Some others live elsewhere on Hainan with other ethnic groups in Danzhou, Wanning, Qionghai, Lingshui and Tunchang.\n\nThe area inhabited by the Li ethnic group totals {{convert|18700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, about 55 percent of the province's total.<ref name=sunnysanya>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnysanya.com/hainan_island/population_people_hainan_island.asp |title=Population and People of Hainan Island}}</ref>\n[[File:Haikou skyline 2 - 2009 09 07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haikou]], the capital of the province as seen looking south from [[Evergreen Park (Haikou)|Evergreen Park]], a large park located on the north shore of the city]]\n\nDuring the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (184\u2212280), Hainan was the Zhuya Commandery ({{lang|zh|\u73e0\u5d16\u90e1}}) under the control of [[Eastern Wu]].\n\nAt the time of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u22121279), Hainan became part of [[Guangxi]], and for the first time large numbers of [[Han Chinese]] arrived, settling mostly in the north. Under the [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol Empire]] (1206\u20131368) the island became an independent province, then in 1370 was placed under the administration of [[Guangdong]] by the ruling [[Ming dynasty]]. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, large numbers of Han people from Fujian and Guangdong began migrating to Hainan, pushing the Li into the highlands in the southern half of the island. In the eighteenth century, the Li rebelled against the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]], which responded by bringing in [[mercenaries]] from the [[Miao people|Miao]] regions of [[Guizhou]]. Many of the Miao settled on the island and their descendants live in the western highlands to this day.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, explorers referred to the island as \"'''Aynam'''\",<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Map of the Island of Aynam\n| url = http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/en/object/?id=7512\n| publisher=Atlas of Mutual Heritage\n| accessdate = February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NCdDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| last1 = Dampier\n| first1 = William\n| author-link = William Dampier\n| title = Mr. Dampier's Voyages\n| volume = 2\n| series = Mr.Dampiers Voyages Around the World\n| year = 1729\n| publisher = London: James & John Knapton}}</ref> which remains the pronunciation of its name in the local [[Hainanese]] dialect.\n\nIn 1906, the revolutionary leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] proposed that Hainan should become a separate province although this did not happen until 1988.\n\n===Republic of China===\n[[File:\u7231\u60c5\u6d77\u9152\u5e97 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A beachside holiday resort in [[Sanya]], the second largest city in Hainan]]\nHainan was historically part of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces and as such was the Qiongya [[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuit]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u74ca\u5d16\u9053}}) under the 1912 establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. In 1921, it was planned to become a [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u74ca\u5d16\u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340}}); in 1944, it became Hainan Special Administrative Region with 16 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] containing the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nDuring the 1920s and 30s, Hainan was a hotbed of [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] activity, especially after a bloody crackdown in [[Shanghai]], the Republic of China in 1927 drove many Communists into hiding. The Communists and the indigenous [[Hlai people]] fought a vigorous [[guerrilla]] campaign against the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] occupation, the [[Hainan Island Operation]] (1939\u201345), but in retaliation the Japanese launched numerous massacres against Hlai villages. [[Feng Baiju]] led the [[Hainan Independent Column]] of fighters throughout the 1930s and 1940s. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the [[Kuomintang]] reestablished control. Hainan was one of the last areas of the Chinese mainland controlled by [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Nationalist forces]], lasting until the PRC launched the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island]] in March 1950.\n\n===People's Republic of China===\nFrom March to May 1950, the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island]] captured the island for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]]. Hainan had been left to the command of [[Xue Yue]] after Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan. [[Feng Baiju]] and his column of guerrilla fighters played an essential role in scouting for the landing operation and coordinated their own offensive from their jungle bases on the island. This allowed the Hainan takeover to be successful where the [[Battle of Kuningtou|Kinmen]] (Quemoy) and [[Battle of Dengbu Island|Dengbu]] assaults had failed in the previous autumn.\n\nThe takeover was made possible by the presence of a local guerrilla force that was lacking also on [[Taiwan Island|Taiwan]]. Hence, while many observers of the Chinese civil war thought that the fall of Hainan Island to the Communists would be followed shortly by the fall of Taiwan Island, the lack of any communist guerrilla force on Taiwan Island and its sheer distance from the mainland made this impossible, as did the arrival of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US 7th fleet]] in the [[Taiwan Strait]] after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June, although highly populated relative to many other international cities, is geographically quite small, with almost no [[urban sprawl]]. Much of the city limits end abruptly with forest or farm land.\n\nOn 1 May 1950, under the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]], the Special Administrative Region became an Administrative Region Office ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6d77\u5357\u884c\u653f\u533a\u516c\u7f72}}), a branch of the Guangdong provincial government.\n\nThe Communists resumed development of the island along the lines established by the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]], but the results were limited by the island's isolation, its humid and [[typhoon]]-prone climate, and its continuing reputation as a place of danger and exile by mainland Chinese. With China's shift in economic policy at the end of the 1970s, Hainan became a focus of attention.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, when Hainan Island was still part of [[Guangdong]] Province, a fourteen-month episode of marketing zeal by Hainan Special District Administrator Lei Yu<ref>Subsequently Vice Mayor of Shenzhen SEZ (May 1985 to January 1988), Executive Vice Mayor of Guangzhou (January 1988 to April 1992) and Vice Chairman of Guangxi AR (April 1992 to January 1996).</ref> put Hainan's pursuit of provincial status under a cloud. It involved the duty-free imports from [[Hong Kong]] of 90,000 Japanese-made cars and trucks at a cost of [[Renminbi|\u00a5]]&nbsp;4.5 billion (US$1.5 billion), and exporting them \u2013 with the help of local naval units \u2013 to the mainland, making 150% profits. By comparison, only 10,000 vehicles were imported into Hainan since 1950. In addition, it involved further consignments of 2.9 million TV sets, 252,000 videocassette recorders & 122,000 motorcycles. The money was taken from the 1983 central government funds destined for the construction of the island's transportation infrastructure (roads, railways, airports, harbours) over the next ten years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nOn October 1, 1984, it became the Hainan Administrative Region ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6d77\u5357\u884c\u653f\u533a}}), with a People's Government, and finally as province separate from [[Guangdong]] four years later. In 1988, when the island was made a separate province, it was designated a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in an effort to increase investment.\n\nThe central government funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities for the construction of the island's other infrastructures (water works, power stations, telecommunications, etc.) and had taken a very liberal interpretation of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods.

To the west of Hainan Island is the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. [[Wuzhi Mountain]] is the highest mountain on the island at {{convert|1840|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nHainan Island measures {{convert|155|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|169|km|abbr=on}} wide.\n\nThe northern half of Hainan is covered with the ancient [[Hainan Volcanic Field]]. Beneath the topsoil is [[volcanic rock]] while the topsoil itself contains small pieces of this [[Vesicular texture|vesicular]] rock.\n \nWetland covers 320,000 hectares, 78,000 hectares of which were created artificially. Most of this is located in the eastern and northern part of Hainan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecns.cn/2016/11-15/233958.shtml|title=China's Hainan island has 320,000 hectares of wetland|website=www.ecns.cn}}</ref>\n\n===Rivers and lakes===\nMost of the rivers in Hainan originate in the central area of the island and flow radially in different directions. The [[Nandu River]] in the northern part of the island is {{convert|314|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and its [[tributary]], the [[Xinwu River]], is {{convert|109|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. Other major rivers include the [[Wanquan River]] at {{convert|162|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long in the east, [[Changhua River]] in the west, and the [[Sanya River]] in the south. Evaporation during the dry season around the coastal areas greatly reduces the flow of the rivers.\n\nThere are very few natural lakes in Hainan. However, there are numerous [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]s, the largest of which is the [[Songtao Reservoir]] in the central-north area.\n\n===Islands===\n{{Further|Islands of Hainan}}\n\n====Nearby islands====\nSeveral small islands exist around the coast of Hainan Island:\n*[[Dazhou Island]] is located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} off the coast of [[Wanning]]\n*[[Haidian Island]], on the north coast, is part of Haikou City\n*[[Nanwan Monkey Island]], in actuality a peninsula\n*[[Phoenix Island]] is an artificial resort island currently under construction in [[Sanya Bay]].\n*[[Wuzhizhou Island]] is located within [[Haitang Bay]]\n*[[Xinbu Island]] is located directly to the east of [[Haidian Island]]\n\nDue to their close proximity to the main island, the flora, fauna, and climate conditions are very similar.\n\n====Disputed islands====\n{{See also|South China Sea Islands}}\n[[File:South China Sea claims map.jpg|thumb|250px|Maritime claims of [[South China Sea]]]]\nA number of small islands, which are located hundreds of kilometers to the south, are claimed and administrated by [[Sansha]] as part of Hainan Province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hainan.gov.cn/code/V3/map |script-title=zh:\u7535\u5b50\u5730\u56fe \u2013 \u6d77\u5357\u7701\u4eba\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u7f51\u7ad9 |publisher=Hainan People's Government |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805085902/http://hainan.gov.cn/code/V3/map/ |archive-date=2010-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Sovereignty of these islands is however disputed.

It includes the removal of litter from towns, villages, and many roadsides. [[Illegal dumping|Small, illegal dumps]] are being removed. However, [[illegal dumping]] of construction debris still occurs on rural roads. Large, plastic dumpsters have been put in place within villages and at countryside road intersections. Towns are being improved with new road and sidewalk surfaces, landscaping features are being created, and many buildings are receiving new fa\u00e7ades.\n\nThis [[Haikou#Massive city-improvement campaign|initiative in Haikou]] has seen entire neighbourhoods demolished and rebuilt, sanitation improved, illegal structures used for business removed, roadside vendors banned, roads and sidewalks replaced, and new street crossings with traffic lights installed.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Hainan varies from subtropical to fully tropical. Northern Hainan, including the island's capital [[Haikou]], has a [[humid subtropical climate]], while most of the rest of the island has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] with warmer annual temperatures the further south a location is. The coldest months are January and February when temperatures drop to {{convert|16|to|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}; the hottest months are July and August, and the temperatures are {{convert|25|to|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.

Parts of Hainan lie in the path of [[typhoon]]s, and 70% of the annual precipitation is derived from typhoons and the summer rainy season. Major flooding occurs due to typhoons, which can cause many problems for local residents.\n\n====Annual fog====\nFrom January to February, the island of Hainan is often affected by thick fog, particularly in coastal areas and the northern part of the island. This is caused by cold winter air from the north coming into contact with the warmer sea, causing the moisture that evaporates from the sea to be condensed into fog. The fog remains from day to night, and is evenly distributed. Visibility may be reduced to {{Convert|50|m|}} for days at a time. During this period, residents normally keep windows shut. The moisture in the air is so extreme that the walls in homes weep, and floors often accumulate a layer of water. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[File:Near Xinlong, Hainan - 01.JPG|thumb|right|This view in [[Wanning]] near the southeast coast is typical of the inland countryside.]]\nHainan has over {{convert|1,500|km2|abbr=on}} of tropical forest, in which live 4,600 kinds of plants and more than 570 species of animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, due to an invasion of exotic species, human impact from tourism, deforestation, and the release of pollutants, many species are under threat.

Adults who are members of a minority also have quite high literacy skills in Chinese. Most adults speak several Chinese dialects, and some also speak Li.\n\nWhen Chams interact with the Hainanese dialect speakers from within Hainan Province, they use the Hainanese dialect, though youngsters generally use Mandarin. Not many can communicate in Li, so the Hainanese dialect or Mandarin is often used.\n\nIn the market place and within the Sanya Municipality, the Cham speakers use Cham among themselves, and with others mostly use the Hainanese dialect. However, in the market places near the government seat of Yanglan Township, the Chams either use the Hainanese dialect or the Mai dialect.<ref name=\"Thurgood 2006\">Thurgood, Graham.

Hainan's elevation to provincial level in 1988 increased its [[accountability]] to the [[Central People's Government]], but by designating the new province a [[Special economic zones of China|special economic zone]] the central government expressed its intent to allow Hainan maximum flexibility in devising programs to facilitate [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and [[economic growth]]. Administratively, the province has been divided into five economic major districts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Politics===\n{{Main|Politics of Hainan|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe politics of Hainan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].\n\nThe [[Governor of Hainan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Hainan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hainan [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary or [[CPC Party Chief]].\n\n===Intelligence===\nPer the research conducted by [[Information Warfare Monitor]], Hainan is the physical location of [[GhostNet]]. The Chinese government has officially denied the existence of a cyber war and intelligence apparatus.\n\n===Administrative===\nIn the official [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] territorial claim, Hainan Province includes not just one island, but also some two hundred [[South China Sea Islands]]. Whilst the containment of the South China Sea Islands means that Hainan Province has a very large water body, it has a disproportionally small land area. [[James Shoal]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u66fe\u6bcd\u6697\u6c99}} Zengmu Ansha), which is presently marked by the PRC, signifies the country's southernmost border. But [[Malaysia]] also claims that it is on their continental shelf.\n\n===Subdivisions===\n{{main|List of administrative divisions of Hainan|List of township-level divisions of Hainan}}\nHainan Province uses a slightly different administrative system than the other [[provinces of China]]. Most other provinces are divided entirely into [[Prefectures of the People's Republic of China|prefecture]]-level divisions, each of which is then divided entirely into [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county]]-level divisions. County-level divisions generally do not come directly under the province. In Hainan, nearly all county-level divisions (the eight districts excepted) come directly under the province. This method of division is due to Hainan's relatively sparse population of around 8 million people. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 9.26 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2018/indexch.htm|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e74\u9274\u20142018|website=www.stats.gov.cn|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; width:90%; font-size:smaller; text-align:center\"\n!

The caverns are capable of hiding up to 20 nuclear submarines from [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]]s. The harbor houses nuclear ballistic missile submarines and is large enough to accommodate [[aircraft carrier]]s. The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] has estimated that China will have five [[type 094 submarine]]s operational by 2010 with each capable of carrying 12 [[JL-2|JL-2 ballistic missiles]]. Two {{convert|950|m|ft|adj=on}} piers and three smaller ones would be enough to accommodate two [[carrier strike group]]s or [[amphibious assault ship]]s.\n\n==Economy==\nHainan's economy is predominantly agricultural, and more than a half of the island's exports are agricultural products. Hainan's elevation to province-level status (1988), however, was accompanied by its designation as China's largest \"[[special economic zone]]\", the intent being to hasten the development of the island's plentiful resources. Prior to this, the province had a reputation for being a \"[[Wild West]]\" area, largely untouched by [[industrialisation]]; even today there are relatively few [[factories]] in the province. [[Tourism]] plays an important part of Hainan's economy, thanks largely to its tropical beaches and lush forests. The central government has encouraged foreign investment in Hainan and has allowed the island to rely to a large extent on market forces.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017-12-06 |script-title=zh:\u6d77\u5357\u7701\u4eba\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u5173\u4e8e\u6269\u5927\u5bf9\u5916\u5f00\u653e\u79ef\u6781\u5229\u7528\u5916\u8d44\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u610f\u89c1 <!--2017\u5e7412\u67086\u65e5 \u743c\u5e9c\u30142017\u301593\u53f7--> |url=http://xxgk.hainan.gov.cn/hi/HI0101/201712/t20171214_2500764.htm |publisher=Hainan People's Government}} or [http://www.hainan.gov.cn/hn/yw/zwdt/tj/201712/t20171217_2502515.html hainan.gov]</ref>\n\nHainan's industrial development largely has been limited to the processing of its mineral and agricultural products, particularly [[rubber]] and [[iron ore]].

These officials were banished to Hainan for periods ranging from 11 days to 11 years for speaking out against what they felt were wrong practices by the emperors. (It is perhaps significant that the establishment of the Five Officials Temple in the late 19th century coincides with a time when China's territorial integrity was under threat, and that several of the officials honoured here were exiled for espousing aggressive policies on the recapture of the north of China from the [[Jurchens]] during the Southern [[Song dynasty]].)\n\n[[Xiuying Fort]] was built in 1891 to defend the southeastern corner of China during the [[Sino-French War]].

He was famous for his lifelong honesty and his willingness to speak out on behalf of local people. In later life, Hai Rui was persecuted and fell out of favour with the emperor. His admirers built the Hai Rui Tomb after his death to commemorate his great works. Construction of the tomb began in 1589.\n\nThe [[Yangpu Ancient Salt Field]] is a heritage site in Yantian village on [[Yangpu Peninsula]].

The first roads were built in the early 20th century, but no major road construction was undertaken in the mountains until the 1950s. Parallel north\u2013south roads along the east and west coasts and through the interior of the island constitute most of Hainan's road network.\n\nHainan is the only province in China that does not have highway toll stations. This is due to the 1994 \"fee-to-tax\" reform.<ref name=\"xinhuanet.com\"/>\n\nThere are several major highways and expressways linking Haikou on the north coast with Sanya on the south coast. The [[China National Highway 224|G224]] is 309 kilometres long and runs through the middle of the province. \nThe Hainan Ring Highway has three parts: The [[China National Highway 225|G225]] is {{convert|429|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} long and is the western part. For most of its length, the G225 runs parallel to the [[Hainan western ring railway]]. The [[China National Highway 223|G223]] is the eastern part, running from Haikou to Sanya. It is 323 kilometres long. The [[G98 Hainan Island Ring Expressway|G98]] is a 612.8-kilometre-long orbital expressway that encircles the island. [[Hainan Highway 1]], a new 1,040-km-long scenic highway, will be built around the island, along the coast starting in May 2019.<ref>https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201903/13/WS5c88c7c4a3106c65c34ee715.html</ref>\n\nThere are also numerous rural roads within the province. These are typically two-way asphalt roads and connect larger towns. Connecting the thousands of villages to one another and to farms, are concrete roads about 6 metres wide. Many of these were built from roughly from the year 2000 onward, and as of 2019, are still being built.\n\n===Bridges===\n\nWhile a bridge connecting Hainan to the Leizhou peninsula on the mainland was planned in the early 2000s it never came to fruition. A bridge or tunnel received continued consideration in 2018, as travel by air or ferry can leave residents and visitors isolated when bad weather sets in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chinaplus.cri.cn/news/china/9/20180223/94355.html|title=Hainan travel chaos: Is it time to build the cross-strait subsea tunnel?|date=June 8, 2018|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Air===\nHainan Province has two international airports ([[Haikou Meilan International Airport]] and [[Sanya Phoenix International Airport]]) and two domestic airports ([[Qionghai Bo'ao Airport]] and [[Danzhou Airport]], the latter is under construction.)\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Ferry_leaving_South_Port_-_03.jpg|thumb|Train ferry of [[Guangdong\u2013Hainan railway]] leaving South Port, Haikou]]\nToday's Hainan is ringed by standard-gauge railways.

controlled by the PRC. It is instead controlled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]], a [[de-facto]] separate country.</ref> and makes up the majority of the province. The name of the island and the province, Hainan, means \"South of the Sea\", reflecting its position south of the [[Qiongzhou Strait]].\n\nThe province has an area of {{convert|33920|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, with Hainan Island making up {{Convert|32900|km2|mi2|-2|sp=us}} (97%) and the rest divided among 200 islands scattered across three archipelagos. It was administered as part of [[Guangdong]] from 1950 to 1988, when it became a separate province; around the same time, it was made the largest [[special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] established by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as part of the [[Chinese economic reform]].\n\nThe [[Li people]], a [[Kra\u2013Dai languages|Kra\u2013Dai]]-speaking [[ethnic group]], are native to the island and are a significant minority group in the province, comprising 15% of the population. Their native languages include the [[Hlai languages]]. They are recognized by the Chinese government as one of the country's 56 [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]]. The [[Han Chinese|Han]] population, who compose a majority of the population at 82%, speak a wide variety of languages including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Min Chinese|Min]] [[Hainanese]], [[Yue Chinese]], [[Be language|Lingaoese]] or [[Hakka Chinese]].<ref>Simons, Gary F.; Fennig, Charles D., eds.

The other major cities are [[Wenchang]], [[Qionghai]], [[Wanning]], [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]], [[Dongfang, Hainan|Dongfang]] and [[Danzhou]].\n\nAccording to China's [[Nine-Dash Line|territorial claims]] several territories in the [[South China Sea]], including the [[Spratly Islands]] (''Nansha'') and [[Paracel Islands]] (''Xisha''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349|title=Why is the South China Sea contentious? - BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-16}}</ref> are notionally administered as [[Sansha]] city of the province.\n{{anchor|Name|Etymology}}\n\n==Names==\nThe provincial name derives from its major island, Hainan, in Hainanese \"Hai Nam\", which is named after its position south of the [[Qiongzhou Strait]]. (To the north of the strait, the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] in Guangdong is also known as ''Haibei/Hai Bac'' or \"North of the Sea\".) Former names for Hainan Island include '''Zhuya''', '''Qiongya''', and '''Qiongzhou'''. The latter two gave rise to the [[Chinese abbreviations|provincial abbreviation]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u74ca}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u743c}}}} (''Qi\u00f3ng/Kheng'').\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric Era===\nHainan was originally attached to the Northeastern part of what is now [[Vietnam]]; however, the island was formed after it physically broke away from [[Vietnam]] due to a [[volcanic eruption]] and drifted southeast near China after the [[Mesozoic]], millions of years ago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.scmp.com/news/china/article/1938422/chinas-southern-island-hainan-born-out-vietnam-millions-years-ago-study|title=China\u2019s southern island of Hainan born out of Vietnam millions of years ago: study|last=Chen|first=Stephen|date=|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial Era===\nHainan Island first entered written [[history of China|history]] in 110 BC, when the [[Han dynasty]] of China established a military [[garrison]] there following the arrival of [[Lu Bode|General Lu Bode]]. In 46 BC the Han court decided that the conquest was too expensive and abandoned the island. Around that time, Han Chinese people together with military personnel and officials began to migrate to Hainan Island from the mainland. Among them were the offspring of those who were banished to Hainan for political reasons. Most of them arrived in Hainan Island from the southern Chinese provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]] and [[Guangxi]].\n\n[[Li people]] (Hlai people) are the original [[Kra-Dai]] inhabitants of Hainan. They are believed to be the descendants of the ancient tribes from the mainland, who settled on the island between 7 and 27 thousand years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/46|title=Tracing the legacy of the early Hainan Islanders \u2013 a perspective from mitochondrial DNA|publisher=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=15 February 2011|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Li people mainly reside in the nine cities and counties in the middle and southern part of Hainan \u2013 the cities of Sanya, [[Wuzhishan City|Wuzhishan]] and Dongfang, the Li autonomous counties of [[Baisha Li Autonomous County|Baisha]], Lingshui, Ledong, [[Changjiang Li Autonomous County|Changjiang]], and the 'Li and Miao Autonomous Counties of [[Qiongzhong Li and Miao Autonomous County|Qiongzhong]] and [[Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County|Baoting]]'. Some others live elsewhere on Hainan with other ethnic groups in Danzhou, Wanning, Qionghai, Lingshui and Tunchang.\n\nThe area inhabited by the Li ethnic group totals {{convert|18700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, about 55 percent of the province's total.<ref name=sunnysanya>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnysanya.com/hainan_island/population_people_hainan_island.asp |title=Population and People of Hainan Island}}</ref>\n[[File:Haikou skyline 2 - 2009 09 07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haikou]], the capital of the province as seen looking south from [[Evergreen Park (Haikou)|Evergreen Park]], a large park located on the north shore of the city]]\n\nDuring the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (184\u2212280), Hainan was the Zhuya Commandery ({{lang|zh|\u73e0\u5d16\u90e1}}) under the control of [[Eastern Wu]].\n\nAt the time of the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u22121279), Hainan became part of [[Guangxi]], and for the first time large numbers of [[Han Chinese]] arrived, settling mostly in the north. Under the [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol Empire]] (1206\u20131368) the island became an independent province, then in 1370 was placed under the administration of [[Guangdong]] by the ruling [[Ming dynasty]]. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, large numbers of Han people from Fujian and Guangdong began migrating to Hainan, pushing the Li into the highlands in the southern half of the island. In the eighteenth century, the Li rebelled against the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]], which responded by bringing in [[mercenaries]] from the [[Miao people|Miao]] regions of [[Guizhou]]. Many of the Miao settled on the island and their descendants live in the western highlands to this day.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, explorers referred to the island as \"'''Aynam'''\",<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Map of the Island of Aynam\n| url = http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/en/object/?id=7512\n| publisher=Atlas of Mutual Heritage\n| accessdate = February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NCdDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| last1 = Dampier\n| first1 = William\n| author-link = William Dampier\n| title = Mr. Dampier's Voyages\n| volume = 2\n| series = Mr.Dampiers Voyages Around the World\n| year = 1729\n| publisher = London: James & John Knapton}}</ref> which remains the pronunciation of its name in the local [[Hainanese]] dialect.\n\nIn 1906, the revolutionary leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] proposed that Hainan should become a separate province although this did not happen until 1988.\n\n===Republic of China===\n[[File:\u7231\u60c5\u6d77\u9152\u5e97 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A beachside holiday resort in [[Sanya]], the second largest city in Hainan]]\nHainan was historically part of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces and as such was the Qiongya [[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuit]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u74ca\u5d16\u9053}}) under the 1912 establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. In 1921, it was planned to become a [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u74ca\u5d16\u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340}}); in 1944, it became Hainan Special Administrative Region with 16 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] containing the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nDuring the 1920s and 30s, Hainan was a hotbed of [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] activity, especially after a bloody crackdown in [[Shanghai]], the Republic of China in 1927 drove many Communists into hiding. The Communists and the indigenous [[Hlai people]] fought a vigorous [[guerrilla]] campaign against the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] occupation, the [[Hainan Island Operation]] (1939\u201345), but in retaliation the Japanese launched numerous massacres against Hlai villages. [[Feng Baiju]] led the [[Hainan Independent Column]] of fighters throughout the 1930s and 1940s. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the [[Kuomintang]] reestablished control. Hainan was one of the last areas of the Chinese mainland controlled by [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Nationalist forces]], lasting until the PRC launched the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island]] in March 1950.\n\n===People's Republic of China===\nFrom March to May 1950, the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island]] captured the island for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]]. Hainan had been left to the command of [[Xue Yue]] after Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan. [[Feng Baiju]] and his column of guerrilla fighters played an essential role in scouting for the landing operation and coordinated their own offensive from their jungle bases on the island. This allowed the Hainan takeover to be successful where the [[Battle of Kuningtou|Kinmen]] (Quemoy) and [[Battle of Dengbu Island|Dengbu]] assaults had failed in the previous autumn.\n\nThe takeover was made possible by the presence of a local guerrilla force that was lacking also on [[Taiwan Island|Taiwan]]. Hence, while many observers of the Chinese civil war thought that the fall of Hainan Island to the Communists would be followed shortly by the fall of Taiwan Island, the lack of any communist guerrilla force on Taiwan Island and its sheer distance from the mainland made this impossible, as did the arrival of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US 7th fleet]] in the [[Taiwan Strait]] after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June, although highly populated relative to many other international cities, is geographically quite small, with almost no [[urban sprawl]]. Much of the city limits end abruptly with forest or farm land.\n\nOn 1 May 1950, under the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]], the Special Administrative Region became an Administrative Region Office ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6d77\u5357\u884c\u653f\u533a\u516c\u7f72}}), a branch of the Guangdong provincial government.\n\nThe Communists resumed development of the island along the lines established by the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]], but the results were limited by the island's isolation, its humid and [[typhoon]]-prone climate, and its continuing reputation as a place of danger and exile by mainland Chinese. With China's shift in economic policy at the end of the 1970s, Hainan became a focus of attention.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, when Hainan Island was still part of [[Guangdong]] Province, a fourteen-month episode of marketing zeal by Hainan Special District Administrator Lei Yu<ref>Subsequently Vice Mayor of Shenzhen SEZ (May 1985 to January 1988), Executive Vice Mayor of Guangzhou (January 1988 to April 1992) and Vice Chairman of Guangxi AR (April 1992 to January 1996).</ref> put Hainan's pursuit of provincial status under a cloud. It involved the duty-free imports from [[Hong Kong]] of 90,000 Japanese-made cars and trucks at a cost of [[Renminbi|\u00a5]]&nbsp;4.5 billion (US$1.5 billion), and exporting them \u2013 with the help of local naval units \u2013 to the mainland, making 150% profits. By comparison, only 10,000 vehicles were imported into Hainan since 1950. In addition, it involved further consignments of 2.9 million TV sets, 252,000 videocassette recorders & 122,000 motorcycles. The money was taken from the 1983 central government funds destined for the construction of the island's transportation infrastructure (roads, railways, airports, harbours) over the next ten years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nOn October 1, 1984, it became the Hainan Administrative Region ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6d77\u5357\u884c\u653f\u533a}}), with a People's Government, and finally as province separate from [[Guangdong]] four years later. In 1988, when the island was made a separate province, it was designated a [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]] in an effort to increase investment.\n\nThe central government funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities for the construction of the island's other infrastructures (water works, power stations, telecommunications, etc.) and had taken a very liberal interpretation of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the re-selling of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the central government to re-finance the special district.\n\nIn 2001 a [[United States Navy]] [[SIGINT|signals intelligence]] aircraft and a [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] fighter jet [[Hainan Island incident|collided in mid-air]] about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away from Hainan, resulting in an international dispute between the United States and the PRC.\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|Geology of Hainan Island}}\n[[File:Hainan topographical map - cropped.jpg|thumb|350px|A topographic map of Hainan Island.]]\nHainan, separated by the [[Qiongzhou Strait]] from the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] of [[Guangdong]], is the largest island administered by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the 42nd largest in the world. The area of Hainan Island ({{Convert|32900|km2|mi2|-2|abbr=on}}, 97% of the province) is similar to that of [[Belgium]] or slightly smaller than that of [[Taiwan]].

The [[Nandu River]] in the northern part of the island is {{convert|314|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and its [[tributary]], the [[Xinwu River]], is {{convert|109|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. Other major rivers include the [[Wanquan River]] at {{convert|162|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long in the east, [[Changhua River]] in the west, and the [[Sanya River]] in the south. Evaporation during the dry season around the coastal areas greatly reduces the flow of the rivers.\n\nThere are very few natural lakes in Hainan. However, there are numerous [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]s, the largest of which is the [[Songtao Reservoir]] in the central-north area.\n\n===Islands===\n{{Further|Islands of Hainan}}\n\n====Nearby islands====\nSeveral small islands exist around the coast of Hainan Island:\n*[[Dazhou Island]] is located about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} off the coast of [[Wanning]]\n*[[Haidian Island]], on the north coast, is part of Haikou City\n*[[Nanwan Monkey Island]], in actuality a peninsula\n*[[Phoenix Island]] is an artificial resort island currently under construction in [[Sanya Bay]].\n*[[Wuzhizhou Island]] is located within [[Haitang Bay]]\n*[[Xinbu Island]] is located directly to the east of [[Haidian Island]]\n\nDue to their close proximity to the main island, the flora, fauna, and climate conditions are very similar.\n\n====Disputed islands====\n{{See also|South China Sea Islands}}\n[[File:South China Sea claims map.jpg|thumb|250px|Maritime claims of [[South China Sea]]]]\nA number of small islands, which are located hundreds of kilometers to the south, are claimed and administrated by [[Sansha]] as part of Hainan Province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hainan.gov.cn/code/V3/map |script-title=zh:\u7535\u5b50\u5730\u56fe \u2013 \u6d77\u5357\u7701\u4eba\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u7f51\u7ad9 |publisher=Hainan People's Government |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805085902/http://hainan.gov.cn/code/V3/map/ |archive-date=2010-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Sovereignty of these islands is however disputed.

It includes the removal of litter from towns, villages, and many roadsides. [[Illegal dumping|Small, illegal dumps]] are being removed. However, [[illegal dumping]] of construction debris still occurs on rural roads. Large, plastic dumpsters have been put in place within villages and at countryside road intersections. Towns are being improved with new road and sidewalk surfaces, landscaping features are being created, and many buildings are receiving new fa\u00e7ades.\n\nThis [[Haikou#Massive city-improvement campaign|initiative in Haikou]] has seen entire neighbourhoods demolished and rebuilt, sanitation improved, illegal structures used for business removed, roadside vendors banned, roads and sidewalks replaced, and new street crossings with traffic lights installed.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Hainan varies from subtropical to fully tropical. Northern Hainan, including the island's capital [[Haikou]], has a [[humid subtropical climate]], while most of the rest of the island has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] with warmer annual temperatures the further south a location is. The coldest months are January and February when temperatures drop to {{convert|16|to|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}; the hottest months are July and August, and the temperatures are {{convert|25|to|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.

Parts of Hainan lie in the path of [[typhoon]]s, and 70% of the annual precipitation is derived from typhoons and the summer rainy season. Major flooding occurs due to typhoons, which can cause many problems for local residents.\n\n====Annual fog====\nFrom January to February, the island of Hainan is often affected by thick fog, particularly in coastal areas and the northern part of the island. This is caused by cold winter air from the north coming into contact with the warmer sea, causing the moisture that evaporates from the sea to be condensed into fog. The fog remains from day to night, and is evenly distributed. Visibility may be reduced to {{Convert|50|m|}} for days at a time. During this period, residents normally keep windows shut. The moisture in the air is so extreme that the walls in homes weep, and floors often accumulate a layer of water. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[File:Near Xinlong, Hainan - 01.JPG|thumb|right|This view in [[Wanning]] near the southeast coast is typical of the inland countryside.]]\nHainan has over {{convert|1,500|km2|abbr=on}} of tropical forest, in which live 4,600 kinds of plants and more than 570 species of animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, due to an invasion of exotic species, human impact from tourism, deforestation, and the release of pollutants, many species are under threat.

Not many can communicate in Li, so the Hainanese dialect or Mandarin is often used.\n\nIn the market place and within the Sanya Municipality, the Cham speakers use Cham among themselves, and with others mostly use the Hainanese dialect. However, in the market places near the government seat of Yanglan Township, the Chams either use the Hainanese dialect or the Mai dialect.<ref name=\"Thurgood 2006\">Thurgood, Graham.

Linguistic Society of the Philippines and SIL International.</ref>\n\n===Life expectancy and \"longevity\"===\nThe people of Hainan live longer than those on the mainland. At the end of 2017, there were 1,565 [[centenarian]]s in Hainan. For every 100,000 people in the province, 17.13 were centenarians. As of March 8, 2018, there were 287,700 residents over 80 years of age, making up 3.15% of the population.<ref>http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-11/30/c_137641618.htm</ref>\n\n==Government==\nEven while Hainan Island was a part of [[Guangdong]] it had a considerable amount of local autonomy; the southern half of the island was an [[autonomous prefecture]]. Hainan's elevation to provincial level in 1988 increased its [[accountability]] to the [[Central People's Government]], but by designating the new province a [[Special economic zones of China|special economic zone]] the central government expressed its intent to allow Hainan maximum flexibility in devising programs to facilitate [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and [[economic growth]]. Administratively, the province has been divided into five economic major districts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Politics===\n{{Main|Politics of Hainan|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe politics of Hainan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].\n\nThe [[Governor of Hainan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Hainan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hainan [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary or [[CPC Party Chief]].\n\n===Intelligence===\nPer the research conducted by [[Information Warfare Monitor]], Hainan is the physical location of [[GhostNet]]. The Chinese government has officially denied the existence of a cyber war and intelligence apparatus.\n\n===Administrative===\nIn the official [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] territorial claim, Hainan Province includes not just one island, but also some two hundred [[South China Sea Islands]]. Whilst the containment of the South China Sea Islands means that Hainan Province has a very large water body, it has a disproportionally small land area. [[James Shoal]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u66fe\u6bcd\u6697\u6c99}} Zengmu Ansha), which is presently marked by the PRC, signifies the country's southernmost border. But [[Malaysia]] also claims that it is on their continental shelf.\n\n===Subdivisions===\n{{main|List of administrative divisions of Hainan|List of township-level divisions of Hainan}}\nHainan Province uses a slightly different administrative system than the other [[provinces of China]]. Most other provinces are divided entirely into [[Prefectures of the People's Republic of China|prefecture]]-level divisions, each of which is then divided entirely into [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county]]-level divisions. County-level divisions generally do not come directly under the province. In Hainan, nearly all county-level divisions (the eight districts excepted) come directly under the province. This method of division is due to Hainan's relatively sparse population of around 8 million people. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 9.26 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2018/indexch.htm|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e74\u9274\u20142018|website=www.stats.gov.cn|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto; width:90%; font-size:smaller; text-align:center\"\n!

Hainan's elevation to province-level status (1988), however, was accompanied by its designation as China's largest \"[[special economic zone]]\", the intent being to hasten the development of the island's plentiful resources. Prior to this, the province had a reputation for being a \"[[Wild West]]\" area, largely untouched by [[industrialisation]]; even today there are relatively few [[factories]] in the province. [[Tourism]] plays an important part of Hainan's economy, thanks largely to its tropical beaches and lush forests. The central government has encouraged foreign investment in Hainan and has allowed the island to rely to a large extent on market forces.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017-12-06 |script-title=zh:\u6d77\u5357\u7701\u4eba\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u5173\u4e8e\u6269\u5927\u5bf9\u5916\u5f00\u653e\u79ef\u6781\u5229\u7528\u5916\u8d44\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u610f\u89c1 <!--2017\u5e7412\u67086\u65e5 \u743c\u5e9c\u30142017\u301593\u53f7--> |url=http://xxgk.hainan.gov.cn/hi/HI0101/201712/t20171214_2500764.htm |publisher=Hainan People's Government}} or [http://www.hainan.gov.cn/hn/yw/zwdt/tj/201712/t20171217_2502515.html hainan.gov]</ref>\n\nHainan's industrial development largely has been limited to the processing of its mineral and agricultural products, particularly [[rubber]] and [[iron ore]].

These officials were banished to Hainan for periods ranging from 11 days to 11 years for speaking out against what they felt were wrong practices by the emperors. (It is perhaps significant that the establishment of the Five Officials Temple in the late 19th century coincides with a time when China's territorial integrity was under threat, and that several of the officials honoured here were exiled for espousing aggressive policies on the recapture of the north of China from the [[Jurchens]] during the Southern [[Song dynasty]].)\n\n[[Xiuying Fort]] was built in 1891 to defend the southeastern corner of China during the [[Sino-French War]].

He was famous for his lifelong honesty and his willingness to speak out on behalf of local people. In later life, Hai Rui was persecuted and fell out of favour with the emperor.

It is 323 kilometres long. The [[G98 Hainan Island Ring Expressway|G98]] is a 612.8-kilometre-long orbital expressway that encircles the island.
