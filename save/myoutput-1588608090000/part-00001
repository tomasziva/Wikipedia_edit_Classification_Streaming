It was released in the United Kingdom on 17 November 1971 and in the United States on 4 December 1971 by [[RCA Records]]. It was his first release through RCA, who would be his label for the next decade. It was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London, featuring [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album was co-produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]], who was an engineer for [[the Beatles]] and Bowie's previous two albums before ''Hunky Dory''. Scott would go on to co-produce his next three albums.\n\nAfter ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', Bowie took time off due to management issues and other disputes. He went on a promotional tour of America in February 1971, helping to create the music and lyrics of ''Hunky Dory.'' Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' represented a shift towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. The album features three homage songs to the American icons [[Andy Warhol]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[the Velvet Underground]], as well as another to his newborn son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]]. Unlike his previous albums, the songs are predominantly piano-driven rather than guitar-driven. They contain lyrics inspired by the work of [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] and philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The cover of the album, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was inspired by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] picture book that Bowie brought with him to the photoshoot.\n\nUpon release, the album received very favourable reviews from a variety of publications but sold poorly, partially due to weak marketing. However, after the commercial breakthrough of his follow-up album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972), ''Hunky Dory'' was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]], giving the album a larger audience. It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is considered to be one of Bowie's finest works. It has been listed by multiple publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, including by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Q magazine|Q]]''. The album has been reissued several times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=The whole ''Hunky Dory'' album reflected my newfound enthusiasm for this new continent that had been opened up to me.

According to Andy Greene of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the tour opened his eyes to new genres he had never explored before. It inspired him to write three tribute songs for three iconic American artists: artist [[Andy Warhol]], singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]] and the rock band [[the Velvet Underground]], more specifically their singer [[Lou Reed]].<ref name=\"Greene RS\" /> After the tour, Bowie returned to Haddon and began writing.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with travelled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used by [[Paul McCartney]] for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by the English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for their 1975 song \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Cann: \"[That's] rubbish.

The band would not have survived that it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album.

him since ''The Man Who Sold the World'', and his previous hard rock and metallic sound was not present. The song was unlike \"[[Space Oddity]]\" and its 1969 parent album, but rather \"pure, unashamedly melodic, gleefully commercial, gorgeously mellifluous pop.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=141}}\n\n\"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" was the first track written for the album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}} The piano style has been compared to the Beatles' \"[[Martha My Dear]]\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201341}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} The lyrics reference the teaching of the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] and his [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], particularly with the lines 'the homo superior', 'the golden ones' and 'homo sapiens have outgrown their use'.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} The 'Homo Superior' refers to Nietzsche's theory of ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'', or \"Superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} There's also a reference to ''[[The Coming Race]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]],{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} a 19th-century novel in which superhumans are found residing in the depths of Earth and subsequently take over as the dominant species.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=356}} Pegg also believes a possible influence is the 1953 [[Arthur C. Clarke]] novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'', in which an alien influence causes to children to rise up against their parents,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=355}} while Doggett believes there is a sense of [[H. G. Wells]] in Bowie's concern about \"the world to come\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} The music itself provides a contrast to the darker themes. According to Doggett, it features the same diatonic major progression in the chorus as \"Changes\" and his future track \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=114}} He further describes Bowie's vocal performance as \"quite unadorned, presented so starkly...that it [is] almost unsettling\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=115}}\n\nDesigned to sound like a \"continuation\" of the previous track,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=143}} \"Eight Line Poem\" is described by Pegg as the album's most \"overlooked\" song.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} It features Bowie's vocal over a gentle, sporadic piano and [[Country music|country]]-influenced guitar line from Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=144}} Featuring exactly eight lines,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=143}} the lyrics portray a room where a cat just knocked over a spinning mobile and a cactus sits in a window.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} Doggett believes there's a metaphor between the cactus and a prairie.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=144}} Around the album's release, Bowie cryptically described the song as \"The city is a kind of high-life wart on the backside of the prairie.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=143}} In a 1973 interview, William Burroughs believed the lyrics to be influenced by [[T.

There are clutches of melody in that that were definite parodies.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} The handwritten notes on the back cover say \"Inspired by Frankie\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=149}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=284}} Like most songs on the album, \"Life on Mars?\" is mostly piano-led, but features a string arrangement from Ronson his very first one{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=285}} that is described by Doggett as \"gargantuan\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} Bowie's vocal recorded in one take{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} is delivered passionately during the chorus and almost nasally in the verses; he hits a high B{{flat}} on the word 'Mars' in the chorus, and holds the note for three bars.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}} In the lyrics, he mentions \"the girl with the mousy hair\", whose identity commentators have debated,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=285}} and says \"look at those cavemen go\", which is borrowed from [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"[[Alley Oop (song)|Alley Oop]]\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=150}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=286}} Greene describes the song as \"the storey of a girl with 'mousy hair' who goes to the movies as an escape from life.\"<ref name=\"Greene RS\" />\n\n\"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" was written as a tribute for Bowie's son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones]], within days of his birth on 30 May 1971. Performed by Bowie as early as 3 June, the ''Hunky Dory'' version features a string arrangement from Ronson and trumpet played by Bolder.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=259\u2013260}} The song is noticeably more \"lightweight\" than the two tracks it is sequenced between, but, according to Pegg, ultimately carries a hint of [the album's] preoccupation with the compulsion to fictionalise life, as Bowie invites his son to 'stay in our lovers' story.'\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=260}} Doggett writes that its inclusion on the album \"ensured its enduring appeal among those who were less entranced by his explorations of politics, psychology, and occult elsewhere on the album.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=129}}\n\nAccording to Pegg, \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" was inspired by Bowie's trip to America in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=383}} However, Doggett states that the song was written ''about'' a lack of inspiration and as a means of ''accessing'' it. English writer [[Colin Wilson]] wrote in his ''[[The Occult: A History|The Occult]]'' (1971) that thought was a form of [[quicksand]] that allowed consciousness to keep the unconscious beyond reach. So, \"Quicksand\" was Bowie's plea to search within himself to be shown the way.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} In the mid-1970s, Bowie described the song as \"a mixture of narrative and surrealism\" and a \"precursor\" to the music of his 1977 album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=383}} Throughout the track, Bowie makes numerous references to Aleister Crowley and his Golden Dawn, [[Winston Churchill]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], and the \"supermen\" of Friedrich Nietzsche.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} The song also evokes spiritualism through the mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings such as [[bardo]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}} Buckley compares the ideas to [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} Bowie would later revisit themes presented in \"Quicksand\" on the [[Station to Station (song)|title track]] of ''[[Station to Station]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} The instrumental track features multiple layers of acoustic guitars on top of each other,{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} which was made at the insistence of Scott.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Fill Your Heart,\" written by [[Biff Rose]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], is the only song on the album not written by Bowie. It replaced \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\" as the side two openers late in the album's development.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Described by Bowie as \"a flower-power [[Randy Newman]]\", Rose was a major influence on Bowie since the late 1960s and is reflected in songs such as \"Conversation Piece\", \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\", \"[[The Supermen]]\" and \"[[Shadow Man (song)|Shadow Man]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} One of the more up-tempo tracks on the album,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} the song is described by Doggett as being \"practically identical\" to Rose's original version found on his 1968 album ''[[The Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side]]'' albeit it's more \"bouncy\" and less \"swung\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=136}} The piano-led arrangement is different than Bowie's live performances of it in 1970, where it was acoustic guitar-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Rose would decades later question Bowie's choice to copy his arrangement, saying \"I mean couldn't you have done your treatment of it?\" Pegg writes that the track provides a \"cogent counterpoint\" to the \"angst\" of \"Quicksand\" and the \"cautionary warnings\" of \"Changes\" and is best remembered for Bowie's saxophone break, Ronson's string arrangement, and Wakeman's piano solo.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A black and white photo of Andy Warhol with a dog|[[Andy Warhol]], between 1966 and 1977]]\n\"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" is a tribute to American artist, producer, and director [[Andy Warhol]],{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=95}} a significant influence on Bowie since the mid-1960s and was described by him as \"one of the leaders\" of \"the media of the streets, street messages.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} It was initially written for Bowie's friend Dana Gillespie, who recorded a studio version, with Bowie producing,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} that was later released on her 1974 album ''Weren't Born a Man''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=42}} Bowie's version, described by Pegg as a \"cult favourite,\" the song is based around a guitar riff, played on two acoustic guitars, that heavily resembles the intro of [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"Silent Song Across the Land\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} The lyrics emphasise Warhol's belief that life and art blur together.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} The song's opening features Ken Scott saying \"This is 'Andy Warhol', and it's taking one,\" only for Bowie to correct his pronunciation of 'Warhol' (saying \"War-holes, as in holes\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=161}} According to Pegg, the ending applause was recorded in the studio bathroom \"in pursuit of the desired acoustic\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} Doggett believes that the opening and closing bits resemble the sound effects on the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} When Bowie played the song for Warhol when they met in September 1971, the artist hated it, reacting by leaving the room; however, Bowie recalled in 1997 that he found the meeting \"fascinating\" because Warhol had \"nothing to say at all, absolutely nothing\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=A black and white photo of Bob Dylan with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica in 1963|[[Bob Dylan]] in 1963]]\n\"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" is another tribute song, this time to American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=95}} Described by Bowie at the time as \"this is how some see BD,\" the song's title is a parody of Dylan's 1962 tribute to American folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]], \"[[Song to Woody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}} Throughout the song, Bowie addresses Dylan by his real name 'Robert Zimmerman,' which Doggett points out [[John Lennon]] did as well on his song \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\" the year prior.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=131}} Pegg and Doggett believe that this highlights Bowie's struggle with identity, from his real name David Jones, to his stage name David Bowie and, very shortly, to Ziggy Stardust.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=131}} The lyrics specifically present Dylan as no longer being a hero figure for rock music, and he must return to his roots and come to the rescue for the unfaithful.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} By 1970, Dylan was the spokesman of a generation. Bowie himself had taken influence from Dylan for his 1969 album ''Space Oddity'', which was primarily folk-rock and featured the use of a [[harmonica]] and acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Upon his refusal to supports political protests of the [[Vietnam War]] and America in the time of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], artists such as [[Country Joe and the Fish]] (with their song \"Hey Bobby\") and the Dylan Liberation Front (whose mission was to \"Free Bob Dylan from himself\") were created.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} According to Doggett, Bowie initially wrote it for his friend George Underwood, who performed it during Bowie's June 1971 BBC session in a Dylanesque voice.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} However, when discussing the song to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1976, Bowie said: \"[That song] laid out what I wanted to do in rock. It was at that period that I said, OK, if you don't want to do it, I will. I saw the leadership void.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} However, Doggett argues that this explanation is invalid because there is nothing in the song that supports this.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=130\u2013131}} The music contains Dylanesque chord changes, and the chorus is derived from the titles of two [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] songs, \"Here She Comes Now\" and \"There She Goes Again\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}} Buckley writes that the song is \"probably the weakest\" on the album, while Pegg notes that it is \"little-regarded\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\n[[File:Velvet Underground WLWH publicity photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|alt=A black and white photo of the Velvet Underground in 1968|[[The Velvet Underground]] in 1968]]\nThe final tribute song on the album, \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" is largely inspired by the Velvet Underground, specifically their lead singer [[Lou Reed]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} The handwritten sleeve notes on the back cover read: \"some V.U. White Light returned with thanks\", indicating an influence of Reed's \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man|Waiting for the Man]]\" and \"[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]].\" There is also a lyrical reference to Reed's song \"[[Sister Ray]].\" Unlike the majority of the album's tracks, \"Queen Bitch\" is primarily guitar-led rather than piano-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} Pegg writes that the guitar riff was inspired by \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} although Doggett disagrees, citing Reed's \"[[Sweet Jane]]\" as the inspiration.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=134}} The chorus sees Bowie mincing his \"satin and tat,\" a nod to [[Lindsay Kemp]]. Pegg states: \"Part of the genius of 'Queen Bitch' is that it filters the archness of [[Marc Bolan]] and Kemp through the streetwise attitude of Reed: this is a song that succeeds in making the phrase 'bipperty-bopperty hat' sound raunchy and cool.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=[It's] another vaguely anecdotal piece about my feelings about myself and my brother, or my other doppelg\u00e4nger.

In 1972, he told an American interviewer, \"I like 'The Bewlay Brothers' so much, only because it's so personal. I'm sure it doesn't mean a thing to anybody else, and I'm sorry if I inflicted myself upon people with that track.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} Many reviewers have found a [[homosexual]] vibe to the track, while others predicted it to be about Bowie's relationship with his [[schizophrenic]] half-brother Terry Burns; he confirmed the latter theory in 1977: \"[that song is] very much based on myself and my brother.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} However, Buckley is unsure about whether the account is fictionalised or real.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Some of the lyrics refer to other tracks on the album: \"the solid book we wrote cannot be found today\" recalls \"Song for Bob Dylan,\" the \"books...fou\u00e9d by the golden ones\" mirror \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", and the \"fakers\" bring us full-circle to \"Changes\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} He also uses the word \"[[chameleon]]\", which would become the most clich\u00e9d word used by rock critics to describe him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=65}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward, at his studio in Heddon Street, off [[Regent Street]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idaea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue but the idaea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Initially shot in monochrome, the picture was re-colored by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-colored photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.{{sfn|Dimery|2005|p=254}}\n\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory,' was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idaea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon,\" using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo,' and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory.' Grace told Bowie, and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The original UK cover featured Bowie's name and the album title while in the US, there was no text and only featured the artist's face; the title was instead printed on a sticker and slapped onto the cellophane wrapping. According to Cann, initial UK pressings were laminated, which enhanced the colour to create a \"superior finish\"; these pressings are now highly sought after items.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The rear side featured Bowie's handwritten notes about each song from the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor).\" The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\n== Release ==\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", Defries sought to extricate Bowie from his contract with [[Mercury Records]], the label that distributed Bowie's previous two albums.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Although his contract was to expire in June 1971, Mercury had intended to renew it with improved terms. However, Defries succeeded in forcing Mercury to terminate his contract in May after threatening to deliver a low-quality album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=605\u2013606}} Defries was then able to pay off Bowie's debts to Mercury through Gem Productions; Mercury then surrendered their copyright on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'' (1970).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} After ending the contract with Mercury, Defries presented the album to multiple labels in the US.

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] praised the album writing, \"On the surface, [having] such a wide range of styles and sounds would make an album incoherent, but Bowie's improved songwriting and determined sense of style instead made ''Hunky Dory'' a touchstone for reinterpreting pop's traditions into fresh, postmodern pop music.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> Michael Gallucci of ''Ultimate Classic Rock'' writes that ''Hunky Dory'' is \"where Bowie starts to become Bowie,\" featuring lyrical and stylistic themes he would replicate on his future albums.

It was released in the United Kingdom on 17 November 1971 and in the United States on 4 December 1971 by [[RCA Records]]. It was his first release through RCA, who would be his label for the next decade. It was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London, featuring [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album was co-produced by Bowie and [[Ken Scott]], who was an engineer for [[the Beatles]] and Bowie's previous two albums before ''Hunky Dory''. Scott would go on to co-produce his next three albums.\n\nAfter ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', Bowie took time off due to management issues and other disputes. He went on a promotional tour of America in February 1971, helping to create the music and lyrics of ''Hunky Dory.'' Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' represented a shift towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. The album features three homage songs to the American icons [[Andy Warhol]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[the Velvet Underground]], as well as another to his newborn son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]]. Unlike his previous albums, the songs are predominantly piano-driven rather than guitar-driven. They contain lyrics inspired by the work of [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] and philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The cover of the album, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was inspired by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] picture book that Bowie brought with him to the photoshoot.\n\nUpon release, the album received very favourable reviews from a variety of publications but sold poorly, partially due to weak marketing. However, after the commercial breakthrough of his follow-up album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972), ''Hunky Dory'' was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]], giving the album a larger audience. It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is considered to be one of Bowie's finest works. It has been listed by multiple publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, including by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Q magazine|Q]]''. The album has been reissued several times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=The whole ''Hunky Dory'' album reflected my newfound enthusiasm for this new continent that had been opened up to me.

According to Andy Greene of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the tour opened his eyes to new genres he had never explored before. It inspired him to write three tribute songs for three iconic American artists: artist [[Andy Warhol]], singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]] and the rock band [[the Velvet Underground]], more specifically their singer [[Lou Reed]].<ref name=\"Greene RS\" /> After the tour, Bowie returned to Haddon and began writing.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with travelled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot!

English writer [[Colin Wilson]] wrote in his ''[[The Occult: A History|The Occult]]'' (1971) that thought was a form of [[quicksand]] that allowed consciousness to keep the unconscious beyond reach. So, \"Quicksand\" was Bowie's plea to search within himself to be shown the way.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} In the mid-1970s, Bowie described the song as \"a mixture of narrative and surrealism\" and a \"precursor\" to the music of his 1977 album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=383}} Throughout the track, Bowie makes numerous references to Aleister Crowley and his Golden Dawn, [[Winston Churchill]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], and the \"supermen\" of Friedrich Nietzsche.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=145}} The song also evokes spiritualism through the mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings such as [[bardo]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}} Buckley compares the ideas to [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} Bowie would later revisit themes presented in \"Quicksand\" on the [[Station to Station (song)|title track]] of ''[[Station to Station]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} The instrumental track features multiple layers of acoustic guitars on top of each other,{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=97}} which was made at the insistence of Scott.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=384}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"Fill Your Heart,\" written by [[Biff Rose]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], is the only song on the album not written by Bowie. It replaced \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\" as the side two openers late in the album's development.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Described by Bowie as \"a flower-power [[Randy Newman]]\", Rose was a major influence on Bowie since the late 1960s and is reflected in songs such as \"Conversation Piece\", \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\", \"[[The Supermen]]\" and \"[[Shadow Man (song)|Shadow Man]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} One of the more up-tempo tracks on the album,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} the song is described by Doggett as being \"practically identical\" to Rose's original version found on his 1968 album ''[[The Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side]]'' albeit it's more \"bouncy\" and less \"swung\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=136}} The piano-led arrangement is different than Bowie's live performances of it in 1970, where it was acoustic guitar-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} Rose would decades later question Bowie's choice to copy his arrangement, saying \"I mean couldn't you have done your treatment of it?\" Pegg writes that the track provides a \"cogent counterpoint\" to the \"angst\" of \"Quicksand\" and the \"cautionary warnings\" of \"Changes\" and is best remembered for Bowie's saxophone break, Ronson's string arrangement, and Wakeman's piano solo.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Andy Warhol by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A black and white photo of Andy Warhol with a dog|[[Andy Warhol]], between 1966 and 1977]]\n\"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" is a tribute to American artist, producer, and director [[Andy Warhol]],{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=95}} a significant influence on Bowie since the mid-1960s and was described by him as \"one of the leaders\" of \"the media of the streets, street messages.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} It was initially written for Bowie's friend Dana Gillespie, who recorded a studio version, with Bowie producing,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} that was later released on her 1974 album ''Weren't Born a Man''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=42}} Bowie's version, described by Pegg as a \"cult favourite,\" the song is based around a guitar riff, played on two acoustic guitars, that heavily resembles the intro of [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"Silent Song Across the Land\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} The lyrics emphasise Warhol's belief that life and art blur together.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=139}} The song's opening features Ken Scott saying \"This is 'Andy Warhol', and it's taking one,\" only for Bowie to correct his pronunciation of 'Warhol' (saying \"War-holes, as in holes\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=161}} According to Pegg, the ending applause was recorded in the studio bathroom \"in pursuit of the desired acoustic\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=41}} Doggett believes that the opening and closing bits resemble the sound effects on the Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

Bowie himself had taken influence from Dylan for his 1969 album ''Space Oddity'', which was primarily folk-rock and featured the use of a [[harmonica]] and acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Upon his refusal to supports political protests of the [[Vietnam War]] and America in the time of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], artists such as [[Country Joe and the Fish]] (with their song \"Hey Bobby\") and the Dylan Liberation Front (whose mission was to \"Free Bob Dylan from himself\") were created.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} According to Doggett, Bowie initially wrote it for his friend George Underwood, who performed it during Bowie's June 1971 BBC session in a Dylanesque voice.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=130}} However, when discussing the song to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1976, Bowie said: \"[That song] laid out what I wanted to do in rock. It was at that period that I said, OK, if you don't want to do it, I will. I saw the leadership void.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} However, Doggett argues that this explanation is invalid because there is nothing in the song that supports this.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=130\u2013131}} The music contains Dylanesque chord changes, and the chorus is derived from the titles of two [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] songs, \"Here She Comes Now\" and \"There She Goes Again\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}} Buckley writes that the song is \"probably the weakest\" on the album, while Pegg notes that it is \"little-regarded\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=442}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}\n\n[[File:Velvet Underground WLWH publicity photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|alt=A black and white photo of the Velvet Underground in 1968|[[The Velvet Underground]] in 1968]]\nThe final tribute song on the album, \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" is largely inspired by the Velvet Underground, specifically their lead singer [[Lou Reed]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} The handwritten sleeve notes on the back cover read: \"some V.U. White Light returned with thanks\", indicating an influence of Reed's \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man|Waiting for the Man]]\" and \"[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]].\" There is also a lyrical reference to Reed's song \"[[Sister Ray]].\" Unlike the majority of the album's tracks, \"Queen Bitch\" is primarily guitar-led rather than piano-led.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} Pegg writes that the guitar riff was inspired by \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}} although Doggett disagrees, citing Reed's \"[[Sweet Jane]]\" as the inspiration.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=134}} The chorus sees Bowie mincing his \"satin and tat,\" a nod to [[Lindsay Kemp]]. Pegg states: \"Part of the genius of 'Queen Bitch' is that it filters the archness of [[Marc Bolan]] and Kemp through the streetwise attitude of Reed: this is a song that succeeds in making the phrase 'bipperty-bopperty hat' sound raunchy and cool.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=382}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=[It's] another vaguely anecdotal piece about my feelings about myself and my brother, or my other doppelg\u00e4nger.

In 1972, he told an American interviewer, \"I like 'The Bewlay Brothers' so much, only because it's so personal. I'm sure it doesn't mean a thing to anybody else, and I'm sorry if I inflicted myself upon people with that track.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} Many reviewers have found a [[homosexual]] vibe to the track, while others predicted it to be about Bowie's relationship with his [[schizophrenic]] half-brother Terry Burns; he confirmed the latter theory in 1977: \"[that song is] very much based on myself and my brother.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} However, Buckley is unsure about whether the account is fictionalised or real.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Some of the lyrics refer to other tracks on the album: \"the solid book we wrote cannot be found today\" recalls \"Song for Bob Dylan,\" the \"books...fou\u00e9d by the golden ones\" mirror \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", and the \"fakers\" bring us full-circle to \"Changes\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=63}} He also uses the word \"[[chameleon]]\", which would become the most clich\u00e9d word used by rock critics to describe him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=65}}ld become the most clich\u00e9d word used by rock critics to describe him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=65}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward, at his studio in Heddon Street, off [[Regent Street]],{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace.

Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead.

He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon,\" using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo,' and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory.' Grace told Bowie, and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The original UK cover featured Bowie's name and the album title while in the US, there was no text and only featured the artist's face; the title was instead printed on a sticker and slapped onto the cellophane wrapping. According to Cann, initial UK pressings were laminated, which enhanced the colour to create a \"superior finish\"; these pressings are now highly sought after items.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The rear side featured Bowie's handwritten notes about each song from the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=234}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor).\" The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\n== Release ==\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] praised the album writing, \"On the surface, [having] such a wide range of styles and sounds would make an album incoherent, but Bowie's improved songwriting and determined sense of style instead made ''Hunky Dory'' a touchstone for reinterpreting pop's traditions into fresh, postmodern pop music.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> Michael Gallucci of ''Ultimate Classic Rock'' writes that ''Hunky Dory'' is \"where Bowie starts to become Bowie,\" featuring lyrical and stylistic themes he would replicate on his future albums. He ultimately concludes that all his future guises begin to find their voices with ''Hunky Dory''.<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> [[Greg Kot]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' writes that the album was \"the first taste of Bowie's multifaceted genius.\"<ref name=\"Kot Chicago Tribune\" /> Reviewing the albums remaster for the 2015 box set ''Five Years 1969\u20131973'', [[Douglas Wolk]] of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' gave the album a perfect 10 out of 10 rating, believing the songs to be \"scattered but splendid\" and considers Bowie's songwriting to be a \"huge leap\" from his previous works.<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\" />\n\nThe album has appeared on numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time by multiple publications. In 1998, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine readers voted ''Hunky Dory'' the 43rd greatest album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 16 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. It was also voted number 23 in the third edition of [[Colin Larkin]] book ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]'' (2000).
