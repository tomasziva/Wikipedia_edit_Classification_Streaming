It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] eight-round [[M1 Garand]] starting in 1936. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during [[World War II]], since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a [[sniper rifle]] during World War II, the [[Korean War]], and even in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]]. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a military drill rifle.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nDuring the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]], the [[Mauser#Spanish M93|M1893 Mauser]] used by the Spanish Army gained a deadly reputation, particularly from the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] where 750 Spanish regulars significantly delayed the advance of 15,000 U.S. troops armed with outclassed [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399 | Springfield Model 1892\u201399 Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] bolt-action rifles and older single-shot Springfield rifles. The Spanish soldiers inflicted 1,400 U.S. casualties in a matter of minutes. Likewise, earlier in the day, a Spanish force of 540 regulars armed with the same Mauser rifle under Spanish General Vara Del Rey held off General [[Henry Ware Lawton]]'s Second Division of 6,653 American soldiers and an Independent Brigade of 1,800 men for ten hours in the nearby town of [[Battle of El Caney|El Caney]], keeping that division from assisting in the attack on the San Juan Heights.  A U.S. Army board of investigation was commissioned as a direct result of both battles. They recommended replacement of the Krag.\n\nThe 1903 adoption of the M1903 was preceded by nearly 30 years of struggle and politics, using lessons learned from the recently adopted Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen and contemporary German [[Gewehr 98|Mauser G98]] bolt-action rifles. The M1903 not only replaced the various versions of the U.S. Army's Krag, but also the [[M1895 Lee Navy|Lee Model 1895]] and [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee]] used by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as all remaining single-shot trap-door [[Springfield Model 1873]]s. While the [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag]] had been issued in both a [[long rifle]] and [[carbine]], the Springfield was issued only as a short 24-inch barrel rifle in keeping with current trends in Switzerland and Great Britain to eliminate the need for both long rifles and carbines.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Chisholm|editor1-first=Hugh|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 23\u201324|date=1911|publisher=University Press|page=328|edition=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGk6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PR8}}</ref>\n\nThe two main problems usually cited with the Krag were its slow-to-load magazine and its inability to handle higher chamber pressures for high-velocity rounds. The United States Army attempted to introduce a higher-velocity cartridge in 1899 for the existing Krags, but its single locking lug on the bolt could not withstand the extra chamber pressure. Though a [[stripper clip|stripper-clip]] or charger loading modification to the Krag was designed, it was clear to Army authorities that a new rifle was required. After the U.S. military's experience with the Mauser rifle in the [[Spanish\u2013American War|1898 Spanish\u2013American War]], authorities decided to adopt a stronger Mauser-derived design equipped with a charger- or stripper clip-loaded box magazine.\n\n===Advances in small arms technology===\nIn 1882, the bolt action [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee|.45 Remington Lee rifle]] design of 1879, with its newly invented detachable box magazine, was purchased in limited numbers by the U.S. Navy. Several hundred 1882 Lee Navy Models (M1882 Remington-Lee) were also subjected to trials by the U.S. Army during the 1880s, though the rifle was not formally adopted. The Navy adopted the Model 1885, and later different style Lee Model 1895 (a 6mm straight pull bolt), which saw service in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In Army service, both the 1885 and 1895 6mm Lee were used in the Spanish\u2013American War, along with the .30 Krag and the .45-70 Model 1873 Springfield. The Lee rifle's detachable box magazine was invented by [[James Paris Lee]], and would be very influential on later rifle designs. Other advancements had made it clear that the Army needed a replacement. In 1892, the U.S. military held a series of rifle trials, resulting in the adoption of the .30  [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] rifle. The Krag officially entered U.S. service in 1894, only to be replaced nine years later by the Springfield M1903.\n\n===Development===\nThousands of [[Mauser Model 1893|Spanish Mauser Model 93]] rifles, surrendered by Spanish troops in Cuba, were returned to the U.S. and extensively studied at Springfield Armory, where it was decided that the Mauser was the superior design.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1900 .30 prototype====\nA prototype rifle was produced in 1900; it was very similar to Rifle No. 5, the final Mauser M92 prototype in the U.S. Army rifle trials of 1892. This design was rejected, and a new design combining features of the 1898 Krag rifle and the 1893 Spanish Mauser was developed.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1901 .30 prototype====\nSpringfield began work on creating a rifle that could handle higher loads around the turn of the 20th century. The Springfield Model 1901 prototype combined the cock-on-opening bolt, 30\" barrel, magazine cutoff, stock and sights of the [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399|Krag-J\u00f8rgensen]] with the dual locking lugs, external claw extractor, and staggered-column magazine of the 1893 Mauser. Taking a cue from the 1898 Mauser [[Gewehr 98]], a large safety lug was added to the side of the bolt behind the extractor, which would engage the receiver bridge and prevent the bolt moving rearwards. The bolt handle was also bent downwards, to make operation of the bolt faster. The Springfield Model 1901 almost entered production. Springfield was sure enough that the Springfield Model 1901 prototype would be accepted that they began making some parts, but it was not accepted and further changes were asked for.\n\n===Adoption===\nFollowing then-current trends in service rifles, the barrel was shortened to 24\" after it was discovered that a longer barrel offered no appreciable ballistic advantage, and the shorter barrel was lighter and easier to handle. This \"short rifle\" also eliminated the need of a shorter carbine for mounted troops or cavalry.<ref name=y03s/> A spike-type bayonet with storage in the fore end of the stock was added to the design. This new design was accepted, type classified and officially adopted as the United States Rifle, Caliber .30, Model 1903 and entered production in 1903. The M1903 became commonly known among its users as the \"ought-three\" in reference to the year '03 of first production.\n\nThe War Department had exhaustively studied and dissected several examples of the Spanish Mauser Model 1893 rifle captured during the Spanish\u2013American War, and applied some features of the U.S. Krag rifle to a bolt and magazine system derived from the Mauser Model 93, to produce the new U.S. Springfield Rifle, the Model 1903. Despite Springfield Armory's use of a two-piece firing pin and other slight design alterations, the 1903 was, in fact, a Mauser design, and after that company brought suit, the U.S. government was judged to pay $250,000 in royalties to [[Mauser]] Werke.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sheehan|first1=John|title=Battlefield tack driver: the model 1903 Springfield in WWI|journal=Guns Magazine|date=1 October 2006|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Battlefield+tack+driver%3a+the+model+1903+Springfield+in+WWI.-a0150451303|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy January 1905 over 80,000 of these rifles had been produced at the federally owned [[Springfield Armory]]. However, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] objected to the design of the sliding rod-type bayonet used as being too flimsy for combat.  In a letter to the Secretary of War, he said:\n\n<blockquote>I must say that I think that ramrod bayonet is about as poor an invention as I ever saw.  As you observed, it broke short off as soon as hit with even moderate violence.  It would have no moral effect and mighty little physical effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kontis|first1=George|title=Are We Forever Stuck with the Bayonet?|journal=Small Arms Defense Journal|date=24 August 2011|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=531|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAll the rifles to that point consequently had to be re-tooled for a blade-type [[bayonet]], called the [[M1905 bayonet|M1905]]. The sights were also an area of concern, so the new improved Model 1904 sight was also added.<ref name=y03s>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2003 |title=100 Years Of The '03 Springfield |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=151 |issue=March |pages=42\u201345&78 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2006 |title=From Poor Invention To America's Best |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=154 |issue=September |pages=59\u201361, 91\u201392&94 }}</ref>\n\nThe retooling was almost complete when it was decided another change would be made. It was to incorporate improvements discovered during experimentation in the interim, most notably the use of pointed ammunition, first adopted by the French in the 1890s and later other countries. The round itself was based on the .30-03, but rather than a 220-grain (14&nbsp;g) round-tip bullet fired at {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, it had a 150-grain (9.7&nbsp;g) pointed bullet fired at {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; the case neck was a fraction of an inch shorter as well. The new American cartridge was designated \"Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30, Model of 1906\". The M1906 cartridge is better known as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] round used in many rifles and machine guns, and is still a popular civilian cartridge to the present day. The rifle's sights were again re-tooled to compensate for the speed and trajectory of the new cartridge.\n\nBy the time of the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition the 1903 Springfield Rifle was the standard issue service rifle of US forces. Some rifles were fitted with both the Warner & Swasey Model 1913 and 1908 \"Musket Sights\" during the campaign. \"Musket Sights\" being the vernacular at the time for telescopic sights. Annecdotal evidence at the time indicates that some of the rifles were fitted with Maxim silencers, which would make them the first U.S. Military Suppressed Rifles. The Warner & Swasey Model 1913 Musket Sight would continue to see service after the Pancho Villa Expedition and during World War I but would be deemed inadequate and was removed from the US Army's inventory by the 1920s. <ref>{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Bruce |date=October 2016 |title= 1916: Guns On The Border |magazine=American Rifleman |publisher=National Rifle Association}}</ref>\n\n===World War I and interwar use===\n[[File:The US Army on the Western Front 1914-1918 Q70181.jpg|thumb|right|US Marines with M1903 rifles and bayonets in France (1918)]]\n[[File:US WWI rifle periscope attachment.jpeg|thumb|An Elder-type [[Periscope rifle|periscope stock]] fitted to an M1903 (1918).

Pre-war production utilized questionable metallurgy. Some receivers constructed of single-heat-treated case-hardened steel were improperly subjected to excessive temperatures during the forging process. The carbon could be \"burnt\" out of the steel producing a brittle receiver.<ref>''Canfield, February 2008, p. 13</ref> Despite documented evidence indicating some early rifles were improperly forged, actual cases of failure were very rare. Although several cases of serious injury from receiver failure were documented, the U.S. Army never reported any fatalities. Many failures were attributed to use of incorrect cartridges, such as the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]].<ref name=l&h>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2004 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=152 |issue=January |pages=20 }}</ref> Evidence also seems to suggest that improperly forged brass cartridge cases could have exacerbated receiver failure.<ref>''Lyon, Joseph: Some Observations On The Failure Of U.S. Model 1903 Rifle Receivers (http://m1903.com/03rcvrfail/)</ref>\n\n[[Pyrometer]]s were installed in December 1917 to accurately measure temperatures during the forging process. The change was made at approximately serial number 800,000 for rifles made at Springfield Armory and at serial number 285,507 at Rock Island Arsenal. Lower serial numbers are known as \"low-number\" M1903 rifles. Higher serial numbers are said to be \"double-heat-treated.\"<ref name=l&h/>\n\nToward the end of the war, Springfield turned out the Model 1903 Mark I. The Mark I has a cut on the left hand side of the receiver meant to act as an ejection port for the [[Pedersen Device]], a modified sear and cutoff to operate the Pedersen Device; a specialized insert that replaced the bolt and allowed the user to fire .30 caliber pistol cartridges semi-automatically from a 40-round detachable magazine. The stock was also slightly cut down on the left side to clear the ejection port. In all other respects, the Mark I is identical to the 1903. Temperature control during forging was improved prior to Mark I production. The receiver alloy was toughened by addition of nickel after Mark I production.\n\nIn 1926, after experiencing the effect of long-range German [[7.92\u00d757mm]] Mauser and machine gun fire during the war, the U.S. Army adopted the heavy 174-grain boat-tail bullet for its .30-06 cartridge, standardized as 'Cartridge, Ball, caliber 30, M1'.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\">Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', 6th ed., DBI Books Inc. (1989), p. 59</ref> M1 ammunition, intended primarily for long-range machine gun use, soon became known by Army rifle competition teams and expert riflemen for its considerably greater accuracy over that of the M1906-round; the new M1 ammunition was issued to infantrymen with the Springfield rifle as well as to machine gun teams.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunlap|first1=Roy|title=Rifles|journal=Ordnance Went up Front: Some Observations and Experiences of a Sergeant of Ordnance, Who Served Throughout World War II with the United States Army in Egypt, the Philippines and Japan, Including Way Stations|date=1948|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ordnance_Went_Up_Front.html?id=vp8QAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2015|oclc=777744849}}</ref> However, during the late 1930s, it became apparent that, with the development of mortars, high-angle artillery, and the .50 caliber [[M2 Browning]] machine gun, the need for extreme long-range, rifle-caliber machine-gun fire was decreasing. In 1938, the U.S. army reverted to a .30-06 cartridge with a 152-grain flat-base bullet, now termed [[M2 Ball]], for all rifles and machine guns.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s and the 1930s, M1903s were delivered to US allies in [[Central America]], such as [[Cuba]], [[Costa Rica]] or [[Nicaragua]]. Costa Rica troops were equipped with Springfields during the [[Coto War]] and some rifles were captured by the opposing Panamanians.<ref name=\"Banana\"/> The Cuban Springfields will be used by [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] forces after WW2 and later by the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces|Revolutionary Armed Forces]], for instance during the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].<ref name=\"Cuba\">{{cite book|title=The Bay of Pigs: Cuba 1961|series = Elite 166|first=Alejandro |last=de Quesada |date=10 Jan 2009|isbn=9781846033230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EE-1CwAAQBAJ|page= 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] acquired some M1903 rifles configured like [[National Rifle Association]] Sporter Models in response to the 1933 [[Kansas City Massacre]].<ref>Vanderpool, Bill \"Bring Enough Gun\" ''[[American Rifleman]]'' October 2013 pp. 80\u201385&115\u2013116</ref>\n\nIn service, the Springfield was generally prized for its reliability and accuracy, though some problems remained. The precision rear aperture sight was located too far from the eye for efficient use, and the narrow, unprotected front sight was both difficult to see in poor light and easily damaged. The U.S. Marine Corps issued the Springfield with a sight hood to protect the front sight, along with a thicker front blade. The two-piece firing pin/striker also proved to be no improvement over the original one-piece Mauser design, and was a cause of numerous Ordnance repairs, along with occasional reports of jammed magazine followers.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>\n[[File:American First World War Official Exchange Collection Q103350.jpg|thumb|right|Camouflaged M1903 Springfield sniper's rifle with Warner & Swasey [[telescopic sight]], in France, May 1918.]]\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] saw new production of the Springfield at private manufacturers such as the [[Remington Arms]] and [[Smith-Corona]] Typewriter companies. Remington began production of the M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the [[Rock Island Arsenal]] which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an \"R\".<ref name=bnc2>{{cite journal |last=Canfield |first=Bruce N. |year=2015 |title=Wartime Remington M1903s? |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=163 |issue=March |pages=44 }}</ref>\n \nM1903 production was discontinued in favor of the M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range elevation setting.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 302</ref> Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier machined part.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/> All stock furniture was also redesigned in stamped metal.\n\nIn late 1942, Smith-Corona Typewriter Company also began production of the M1903A3 at its plant in Syracuse, NY.<ref name=\"Brophy, William 1985 p. 187\">Brophy, William, ''The Springfield 1903 Rifles'', Stackpole Books (1985), p. 187</ref> Smith/Corona parts are mostly identified by the absence of markings. Except for occasions when time permitting during manufacture, on early to mid production rifles, and also only on certain parts.\n\n{{citation needed span|text=Smith/Corona bolts are sometimes marked with an \"X\" on top of the bolt handle root, which appears as a simple two-line \"X\". The underside of the bolt handle root, will also be marked with a inspectors inspection number, and a punch marking from the hardness testing. This \"X\" markings is often misidentified as the \"H\" marking, that is found on field replacement bolts produced by Hadley Tool co. The \"H\" marking is easily identified by its use of a cursive bubble script. Which appears to be a X at a glance, but is easily distinguishable from the Smith Corona \"X\", when compared to one another. Due to the Smith Corona \"X\" being a simple two-line X, often referred to as the \"crossed twigs\" Front sight bases are also found to be occasionally marked with a \"G\" on the side between the two pin holes used for mounting the base to the barrel, and to affix the sight blade. This \"G\" mark may also be found on the bolt/safety shroud, but hidden on an assembled bolt. This is due to it being stamped on the inner face of the shroud facing the striker/firing pin assembly, as to be hidden on an assembled bolt. The shroud is also identified by a scalloped cut on top, but this does not absolutely identify the shroud as a Smith Corona part. One must remember the machines and plans were obtained by other manufacturers after Smith Corona and ended WW2 production. This was to be done to manufacture replacement parts at the end of and post WW2. As such, these manufacturers used the designs as completed by Smith Corona. As expected shrouds and other parts will look nearly identical to Smith Corona original parts, but bear other markings. Such as, \"BP\" marked shrouds, \"CC\" marked bolt bodies, and other parts manufactured using the Smith Corona designs. The only \"S\" marking, that might be found, is found on the extractor. This marking is located on the down-facing side, when mounted on the bolt, in the same area as the dovetailed mounting point underneath the extractor when mounted. Smith Corona buttplates, are only marked by the design of the stamped checkering, which will be 9 to 10 lines per inch. As opposed to a WW2 Remington or replacement stamped 1903a3 buttplate, which consist of 16 or more lines per inch. The stamped trigger guard, is found both with the \"small early\" and \"large mid to late\" trigger bow. A Smith Corona part, however, is identified by the reinforcement stamping line directly behind the forward most action screws (sometimes referred to as the king screw). The stamped reinforcement line behind the forward screw, is shaped in a U or semicircle surrounding the rear portion of the screw. As opposed to a Remington manufactured parts straight line stamping in the same location. Rear adjustable sights appear to be of near-identical design, except for finish and the lack of identifying marks on the base or the sight itself. The rear sight has been observed being removed from original sealed WW2 packaging, and in time period photos, as to having two external finish types. Photos show very early production rear sights being completely finished in a hot caustic bluing. All other confirmed original rear sights, have been noted to have a grey phosphate finished base, and the sight itself being blued. Smith Corona rifle stocks in as new original non-rearsenaled condition, lacking a Depot or arsenal stamp with only a single circle P proof, have all been noted to have certain original as manufactured markings or proofs. The left side of the stock, on the wrist area, are marked with a boxed-in FJA inspector stamp followed by the crossed cannon arsenal stamp. The order of the stamps are reversed from Remington production stocks, and lack the RA marking (Remington Arms) preceding the other markings. Just forward of the trigger guard on the underside of the stock, are 4 inspection numbers encased in differing shapes. There may be more present, if the stock or rifle has been reworked in the past, but originally there was to be 4 inspection processes marked here. Numbers differing by inspector, the shapes they are enclosed in have been observed to the same on each original example in the same position. Left to right, top to bottom, they are as follows. Top left, number in a triangle, top right, number in a circle, bottom left, number in a square, and unique to Smith Corona stocks, bottom right, number in a diamond. Just behind the bow of the trigger guard is the P proof, that is usually present on US arms of this period and before on the bottom of the stock wrist grip. Unique to the Smith Corona, is the larger size of this proof of 7/16, when compared to a noticeably smaller Remington proof. The inlet cut for the Smith Corona stocks band spring, just forward of the rear stock band, is also of a unique rounded corners design as opposed to Remington's squared corners appearance. |reason=User:Brandon Gvt seems to have forgotten to provide a source for this new information they added|date=August 2019}} \n\nTo speed production output, two-groove rifled barrels were adopted, and steel alloy specifications were relaxed under 'War Emergency Steel' criteria for both rifle actions and barrels.<ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 362</ref> M1903A3 rifles with two-groove 'war emergency' barrels were shipped with a printed notation stating that the reduction in rifling grooves did not affect accuracy.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 301</ref>  As the war progressed, various machining and finishing operations were eliminated on the M1903A3 in order to increase production levels.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\"/>\n\nOriginal production rifles at Remington and Smith-Corona had a dark gray/black finish similar to the bluing of late World War I. Beginning in late 1943 a lighter gray/green parkerizing finish was used. This later finish was also used on arsenal repaired weapons.\nIt is somewhat unusual to find a World War I or early World War II M1903 with its original dated barrel. Much, if not all, World War II .30-06 ammunition used a corrosive primer which left corrosive salts in the barrel. If not removed by frequent and proper barrel cleaning these residues could cause pitting and excessive wear. In the jungle fighting on various Pacific islands cleaning was sometimes lax and the excessive moisture compounded the corrosive action of the residue.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bishop | first = Chris| title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II | place = New York | publisher = Orbis Publishing Ltd | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7607-1022-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe M1903 and the M1903A3 rifle were used in combat alongside the M1 Garand by the U.S. military during World War II and saw extensive use and action in the hands of U.S. troops in Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific. The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were initially armed with M1903 rifles in early battles in the Pacific, such as the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], but the jungle battle environment generally favored self-loading rifles;<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391: \"Nearly every one [Marine] I talked to [on Guadalcanal] who used the Springfield in combat-without a scope-would have much rather been using a Garand.\"</ref> later Army units arriving to the island were armed with the M1 Garand.<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391</ref> The [[U.S. Army Rangers]] were also a major user of the M1903 and the M1903A3 during World War II with the Springfield being preferred over the M1 Garand for certain commando missions.\n\nAccording to Bruce Canfield's encyclopedic ''U.S. Infantry Weapons of WW II'', final variants of the M1903 (the A3 and A4) were delivered in February 1944.<ref name=bnc2/> By then, most American combat troops had been re-equipped with the M1 Garand. However, some front-line infantry units in both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps retained M1903s as infantry rifles beyond that date and continued to use them alongside the M1 Garand until the end of the Second World War in 1945. The Springfield remained in service for [[sniper]]s (using the '''M1903A4'''), [[grenadier]]s (using a spigot type rifle [[22 mm grenade|22 mm] with the M1 grenade launcher] [[grenade launcher]] until the M7 grenade launcher was available for the M1 rifle in late 1943), and Marine [[Scout Sniper]] units.\n\n==== Sniper rifle====\nThe M1903A4 was the U.S. Army's sniper rifle of choice during the Second World War. The M1903A4 was a variation of the M1903A3. The only difference between receivers was that the model and serial number on the receiver were split on 1903A4 to make room for the Redfield scope mount. The Redfield scope mount removed the rear peep sight that was standard on the M1903A3. The scope used on the M1903A4 was a Weaver Model 330 or 330C, which was a 2.75x telescopic sight. The receivers were tested by Remington Arms and those that were deemed best, meaning those closest to design specifications were selected to become M1903A4's. The barrels were also selected specifically to be added to the M1903A4 rifle only if they were within almost exact specifications for the design. The front sight on the barrel was never installed on the A4 barrels, however, the notch for it was still in place. .<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>  Barrel specifications were, in general, unchanged between the M1903A3 and M1903A4, however, the War Department did start installing barrels with 2 groove rifling instead of 4 groove, despite the lack of clear changes from the 4 groove rifling that was the standard up until 1942.<ref>George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392</ref>\n\nBy some accounts, the M1903A4 was inadequate as a sniper rifle. The M1903A4 was a relatively accurate rifle with an effective range of about 600 yards (550m). These limitations on long-range targeting were due to the limited field of view present in both the M73 and M73B1 scopes. From its adoption in 1943 until the end of the war it was used extensively in every theater of operation by both the US Army and the USMC.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\">George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392\u2013393</ref> The Weaver scopes (later standardized as the M73 and M73B1) were not only low-powered in magnification, they were not waterproofed, and frequently fogged over or became waterlogged during humidity changes. In addition, the M81/82 optional scopes also had significant flaws. They most notably had less power (2.2x vs. 2.75x) and, like the other scopes on the M1903A4, had serious issues with the field of view.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/><ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\"/><ref>George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 296\u2013299</ref> The USMC would eventually switch to a large 8x scope that spanned the length of the rifle designed by John Unertl.\n\n==== Foreign users==== \nThe U.S. Army Military Police (MP) and the U.S. Navy Shore Patrol also used M1903s and M1903A3s throughout the war. Various U.S. allies and friendly irregular forces were also equipped with the weapon. The [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] (FEB), operating in the 5th Army in Italy was equipped with Springfield M1903 rifles. In August 1943, the [[Free French Forces]] of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] were re-equipped by the United States primarily with M1903A3 Springfield and [[M1917 Enfield Rifle]]s. The M1903A3 became one of the primary rifles used by French forces until the end of the war, and was afterwards used  in [[Indochina]]<ref name=\"Viet Minh\">{{cite book|title=French Foreign L\u00e9gionnaire vs Viet Minh Insurgent: North Vietnam 1948\u201352|series=Combat 36|first=Martin |last=Windrow|date=20 Sep 2018|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=9781472828910|page=22}}</ref> and by local militia and security forces in French [[Algeria]].<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-14-15-texte-integral}}</ref> Large numbers of M1903 Springfields were sent to China.<ref name =\"Chinese Army\">{{cite book|title=The Chinese Army 1937\u201349: World War II and Civil War|series=Men-at-Arms 424|first=Philip |last=Jowett|date=10 Jul 2005|isbn=9781841769042|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|page=19}}</ref>\nDuring the Korean War,South Korean Marines used M1903A3<ref>{{cite book|last=\ubd80|first=\ucc3d\uc625|title=\ud55c\uad6d \uc804\uc7c1 \uc218\ucca9: \uc5b4\ub290 \ud559\ub3c4\ubcd1 \uc758 \ucc38\uc804 \uc77c\uae30\n|year=2012|location=\uacbd\uae30 \uace0\uc591\uc2dc|publisher= \ud55c\uadf8\ub8e8 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4|isbn=9791195158027 |page= 6}}</ref>[[File:South Koreans Marines m1903a3.png|thumb|South Korean marine armed with M1903 rifle, September 20, 1950.]]\nSpringfield M1903 rifles captured by the Germans were designated '''Gewehr 249(a).'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Robert W.

Still, some M1903A4s remained in sniper use as late as the Vietnam War; and technical manuals for them were printed as late as 1970.<ref name=y03s/> The U.S. Navy also continued to carry some stocks of M1903A3s on board ships, for use as anti-mine rifles.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:USMC-120801-M-VG714-002.jpg|thumb|M1903 Springfield used during a vintage sniper rifle match in 2012]]\n\nDue to its balance, it is still popular with various military drill teams and color guards, most notably the U.S. Army Drill Team.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} M1903 rifles (along with the M1 Garand, M1917 Enfield and M14 rifles) are also common at [[high school]] [[Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (JROTC) units to teach weapons handling and military drill procedures to the cadets. JROTC units use M1903s for regular and inter-school competition drills, including elaborate exhibition spinning routines. Exhibition teams often use fiberglass stocks in place of wooden stocks, which are heavier and more prone to breakage when dropped. JROTC Color Guards still favor wooden stocks over fiberglass because of their weight characteristics and appearance. The M1903 is also the standard parade rifle of the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]], which has over six hundred M1903s, a very small percentage of which are still fireable. The Summerall Guards of The Citadel South Carolina Corps of Cadets in Charleston, S.C. also use the Springfield 1903 model for their silent drill performances, which include annual trips to [[Mardi Gras]], as well as many other notable performances.\n\nContemporary hunters and shooting enthusiasts value the rifle for its beauty, dependability, and adaptability for almost all U.S. game animals.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps]] color guard rifles bear many similarities to the Springfield.\n\n\nIn 1977, the Army located a rather large cache of unissued M1903A3 rifles which were demilitarized and then issued to JROTC units as a replacement for their previously issued [[M1 Garand]] and [[M14 rifle|M14]] rifles, which were then returned to Army custody due to concerns about potential break-ins at high school JROTC armories.\n\nFor safety reasons, the JROTC M1903s are made permanently unable to fire by plugging the barrel with a steel rod, or having it filled with lead, soldering the bolt and welding the magazine cutoff switch in the ON position.  To plug the barrel, a very cold steel rod was inserted; after it warmed up it was too tight to remove.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Caliber 30 Springfield Rifle.JPG|thumb|Diagram of the .30 Springfield Rifle]]\nThe U.S. rifle, Model of 1903 was 44\u215e&nbsp;inches (1.098&nbsp;m) long and weighed 8&nbsp;[[Avoirdupois|lb]] 11&nbsp;oz (3.95&nbsp;kg). A bayonet could be attached; the [[M1905 bayonet]] blade was 16&nbsp;in (406&nbsp;mm) long and weighed 1&nbsp;lb (0.45&nbsp;kg). From 1906, the rifle was chambered to fire the .30-[[caliber]] M1906 [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] (.30-06 cartridge), later the M1 (1926) and [[M2 Ball]] (1938) rounds. There were four standard types of cartridge:\n\n* '''Ball''': consisted of a brass case or shell, primer, a charge of smokeless powder, and the bullet. The bullet had a sharp point called a [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]], and was composed of a lead core and a jacket of [[cupro-nickel]] (later gilding metal), and in the M1906 design, weighed 150&nbsp;[[Grain (measure)|grains]] (9.7&nbsp;g). The bullet of the M1906 cartridge, when fired from the rifle, had an initial velocity of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Blank''': contained a paper cup instead of a bullet. It is dangerous up to {{convert|33|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Guard''': had a smaller charge of powder than the ball cartridge, and five [[cannelure]]s encircle the body of the shell at about the middle to distinguish it from ball cartridges. It was intended for use on guard or in riot duty, and it gave good results up to {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The range of {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} required a sight elevation of {{convert|450|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and the range of {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} required an elevation of {{convert|645|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Dummy''': this was tin-plated and the shell was provided with six longitudinal corrugations and three circular holes. The primer contains no percussion composition. It was intended for drill purposes to accustom the soldier to the operation of loading the rifle.\n\nThe rifle was sighted for {{convert|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} and had a point-blank range of {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The maximum range of the ball cartridge, when elevated at an angle of 45\u00b0, was {{convert|4890|yd|km mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rifle was a magazine-fed clip-loader and could fire at a rate of 20 shots per minute. Each [[stripper clip]] contained five cartridges, and standard issue consisted of 12 clips carried in a cloth bandoleer. When full the [[bandoleer]] weighed about {{convert|3|lb|14|oz|kg|abbr=on}}. Bandoleers were packed 20 in a box, for a total of 1,200 rounds. The full box weighed {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe bore of the rifle is 0.30&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;mm) in diameter. It was then rifled 0.004&nbsp;in (0.1&nbsp;mm) deep, making the diameter from the bottom of one groove to the bottom of the opposite groove 0.30787 in (7.82&nbsp;mm) of the barrel.\n\nThe 1903 rifle included a rear sight leaf that could be used to adjust for elevation. When the leaf was flat, the battle sight appeared on top. This sight was set for {{convert|547|yd|abbr=on}}, and was not adjustable. When the leaf was raised it could be adjusted to a maximum extreme range of {{convert|2850|yd|abbr=on}}. The rear sight could also be adjusted for windage.\n\nThe 1903A3 rear sight was an aperture sight adjustable both for elevation and windage.\n\nA feature inherent to the M1903 and not found on the [[Gewehr 98|Mauser 98]] is the cocking piece, a conspicuous knob at the rear of the bolt, allowing the rifle's striker to be released without dry firing, or to cock the rifle if necessary, for example to attempt a second strike on a round that failed to fire.\n\n==Variants==\nThere were four main variants given official nomenclature, though there are a number of important sub-variants:\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A3]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903 with 'scant' [[Stock (firearm)|stock]]]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A4 with M84 sight.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A4 with Type C stock and M84 sight]]\n*'''M1903 (1903)''': developed for the [[.30-03]] (also known as the .30-45) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].

Production barrels were measured with star-gauges, and those meeting specified tolerances were stamped with an asterisk shaped star on the muzzle crown. These barrels were fitted to selected receivers with hand-fitted and polished parts. The bolt was left unblued while the receiver and barrel were finished with a black Parkerizing process. Some bolts have the safety direction reversed to prevent it from striking the nose of a right-handed shooter, and those made from 1924 to 1929 have the knurled cocking piece removed to decrease lock time. Early rifles used the type S stock until the type C stock became standard in 1929. Rifles made for sale to NRA members (priced at $40.44) were drilled and tapped for a Lyman 48 receiver sight and had either a type B (or NB) stock with no grasping grooves and a noticeable drop at the heel for a long pistol grip, or a special National Match stock with a high comb and pistol grip. Total production was 28,907. Most were issued to service teams and 25,377 were reconditioned at Springfield armory after one year of match use. Reconditioned rifles have a large gas-escape port drilled into the left side of the receiver.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Norell |first1=James O.E. |year=2003 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=151 |issue=July |pages=38\u201341 }}</ref>\n**'''M1903 Bushmaster carbine (1940s)''': the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] and stock were cut down {{convert|18|in|mm}} for easier use in [[Panama]]; 4,725 such rifles were made.

There were thousands of stock blanks that had been sized for the old straight stock. They weren't deep enough for the full pistol grip of the Type C stock, so they were modified to allow a \"scant\" grip that was the largest grip they could form. These \"scant\" stocks would only fit on a 1903, and would not fit an 03A3. Springfield only rebuilt existing M1903 rifles using this stock in 1942 and marked the cut-off seat with a small \"s\".\n[[File:1930 Springfield 1903A1.JPG|thumb|Springfield 1903A1 rifle]]\n*'''M1903A1 (1929\u20131939)''': changed from a straight stock to a pistol grip type stock (Type C stock).

It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] eight-round [[M1 Garand]] starting in 1936. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during [[World War II]], since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a [[sniper rifle]] during World War II, the [[Korean War]], and even in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]]. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a military drill rifle.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nDuring the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]], the [[Mauser#Spanish M93|M1893 Mauser]] used by the Spanish Army gained a deadly reputation, particularly from the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] where 750 Spanish regulars significantly delayed the advance of 15,000 U.S. troops armed with outclassed [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399 | Springfield Model 1892\u201399 Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] bolt-action rifles and older single-shot Springfield rifles. The Spanish soldiers inflicted 1,400 U.S. casualties in a matter of minutes. Likewise, earlier in the day, a Spanish force of 540 regulars armed with the same Mauser rifle under Spanish General Vara Del Rey held off General [[Henry Ware Lawton]]'s Second Division of 6,653 American soldiers and an Independent Brigade of 1,800 men for ten hours in the nearby town of [[Battle of El Caney|El Caney]], keeping that division from assisting in the attack on the San Juan Heights.  A U.S. Army board of investigation was commissioned as a direct result of both battles. They recommended replacement of the Krag.\n\nThe 1903 adoption of the M1903 was preceded by nearly 30 years of struggle and politics, using lessons learned from the recently adopted Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen and contemporary German [[Gewehr 98|Mauser G98]] bolt-action rifles. The M1903 not only replaced the various versions of the U.S. Army's Krag, but also the [[M1895 Lee Navy|Lee Model 1895]] and [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee]] used by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as all remaining single-shot trap-door [[Springfield Model 1873]]s. While the [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag]] had been issued in both a [[long rifle]] and [[carbine]], the Springfield was issued only as a short 24-inch barrel rifle in keeping with current trends in Switzerland and Great Britain to eliminate the need for both long rifles and carbines.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Chisholm|editor1-first=Hugh|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 23\u201324|date=1911|publisher=University Press|page=328|edition=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGk6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PR8}}</ref>\n\nThe two main problems usually cited with the Krag were its slow-to-load magazine and its inability to handle higher chamber pressures for high-velocity rounds. The United States Army attempted to introduce a higher-velocity cartridge in 1899 for the existing Krags, but its single locking lug on the bolt could not withstand the extra chamber pressure. Though a [[stripper clip|stripper-clip]] or charger loading modification to the Krag was designed, it was clear to Army authorities that a new rifle was required. After the U.S. military's experience with the Mauser rifle in the [[Spanish\u2013American War|1898 Spanish\u2013American War]], authorities decided to adopt a stronger Mauser-derived design equipped with a charger- or stripper clip-loaded box magazine.\n\n===Advances in small arms technology===\nIn 1882, the bolt action [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee|.45 Remington Lee rifle]] design of 1879, with its newly invented detachable box magazine, was purchased in limited numbers by the U.S. Navy. Several hundred 1882 Lee Navy Models (M1882 Remington-Lee) were also subjected to trials by the U.S. Army during the 1880s, though the rifle was not formally adopted. The Navy adopted the Model 1885, and later different style Lee Model 1895 (a 6mm straight pull bolt), which saw service in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In Army service, both the 1885 and 1895 6mm Lee were used in the Spanish\u2013American War, along with the .30 Krag and the .45-70 Model 1873 Springfield. The Lee rifle's detachable box magazine was invented by [[James Paris Lee]], and would be very influential on later rifle designs. Other advancements had made it clear that the Army needed a replacement. In 1892, the U.S. military held a series of rifle trials, resulting in the adoption of the .30  [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] rifle. The Krag officially entered U.S. service in 1894, only to be replaced nine years later by the Springfield M1903.\n\n===Development===\nThousands of [[Mauser Model 1893|Spanish Mauser Model 93]] rifles, surrendered by Spanish troops in Cuba, were returned to the U.S. and extensively studied at Springfield Armory, where it was decided that the Mauser was the superior design.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1900 .30 prototype====\nA prototype rifle was produced in 1900; it was very similar to Rifle No. 5, the final Mauser M92 prototype in the U.S. Army rifle trials of 1892. This design was rejected, and a new design combining features of the 1898 Krag rifle and the 1893 Spanish Mauser was developed.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1901 .30 prototype====\nSpringfield began work on creating a rifle that could handle higher loads around the turn of the 20th century. The Springfield Model 1901 prototype combined the cock-on-opening bolt, 30\" barrel, magazine cutoff, stock and sights of the [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399|Krag-J\u00f8rgensen]] with the dual locking lugs, external claw extractor, and staggered-column magazine of the 1893 Mauser. Taking a cue from the 1898 Mauser [[Gewehr 98]], a large safety lug was added to the side of the bolt behind the extractor, which would engage the receiver bridge and prevent the bolt moving rearwards. The bolt handle was also bent downwards, to make operation of the bolt faster. The Springfield Model 1901 almost entered production. Springfield was sure enough that the Springfield Model 1901 prototype would be accepted that they began making some parts, but it was not accepted and further changes were asked for.\n\n===Adoption===\nFollowing then-current trends in service rifles, the barrel was shortened to 24\" after it was discovered that a longer barrel offered no appreciable ballistic advantage, and the shorter barrel was lighter and easier to handle. This \"short rifle\" also eliminated the need of a shorter carbine for mounted troops or cavalry.<ref name=y03s/> A spike-type bayonet with storage in the fore end of the stock was added to the design. This new design was accepted, type classified and officially adopted as the United States Rifle, Caliber .30, Model 1903 and entered production in 1903. The M1903 became commonly known among its users as the \"ought-three\" in reference to the year '03 of first production.\n\nThe War Department had exhaustively studied and dissected several examples of the Spanish Mauser Model 1893 rifle captured during the Spanish\u2013American War, and applied some features of the U.S. Krag rifle to a bolt and magazine system derived from the Mauser Model 93, to produce the new U.S. Springfield Rifle, the Model 1903. Despite Springfield Armory's use of a two-piece firing pin and other slight design alterations, the 1903 was, in fact, a Mauser design, and after that company brought suit, the U.S. government was judged to pay $250,000 in royalties to [[Mauser]] Werke.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sheehan|first1=John|title=Battlefield tack driver: the model 1903 Springfield in WWI|journal=Guns Magazine|date=1 October 2006|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Battlefield+tack+driver%3a+the+model+1903+Springfield+in+WWI.-a0150451303|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy January 1905 over 80,000 of these rifles had been produced at the federally owned [[Springfield Armory]]. However, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] objected to the design of the sliding rod-type bayonet used as being too flimsy for combat.  In a letter to the Secretary of War, he said:\n\n<blockquote>I must say that I think that ramrod bayonet is about as poor an invention as I ever saw.  As you observed, it broke short off as soon as hit with even moderate violence.  It would have no moral effect and mighty little physical effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kontis|first1=George|title=Are We Forever Stuck with the Bayonet?|journal=Small Arms Defense Journal|date=24 August 2011|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=531|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAll the rifles to that point consequently had to be re-tooled for a blade-type [[bayonet]], called the [[M1905 bayonet|M1905]]. The sights were also an area of concern, so the new improved Model 1904 sight was also added.<ref name=y03s>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2003 |title=100 Years Of The '03 Springfield |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=151 |issue=March |pages=42\u201345&78 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2006 |title=From Poor Invention To America's Best |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=154 |issue=September |pages=59\u201361, 91\u201392&94 }}</ref>\n\nThe retooling was almost complete when it was decided another change would be made. It was to incorporate improvements discovered during experimentation in the interim, most notably the use of pointed ammunition, first adopted by the French in the 1890s and later other countries. The round itself was based on the .30-03, but rather than a 220-grain (14&nbsp;g) round-tip bullet fired at {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, it had a 150-grain (9.7&nbsp;g) pointed bullet fired at {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; the case neck was a fraction of an inch shorter as well. The new American cartridge was designated \"Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30, Model of 1906\". The M1906 cartridge is better known as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] round used in many rifles and machine guns, and is still a popular civilian cartridge to the present day. The rifle's sights were again re-tooled to compensate for the speed and trajectory of the new cartridge.\n\nBy the time of the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition the 1903 Springfield Rifle was the standard issue service rifle of US forces. Some rifles were fitted with both the Warner & Swasey Model 1913 and 1908 \"Musket Sights\" during the campaign. \"Musket Sights\" being the vernacular at the time for telescopic sights. Annecdotal evidence at the time indicates that some of the rifles were fitted with Maxim silencers, which would make them the first U.S. Military Suppressed Rifles. The Warner & Swasey Model 1913 Musket Sight would continue to see service after the Pancho Villa Expedition and during World War I but would be deemed inadequate and was removed from the US Army's inventory by the 1920s. <ref>{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Bruce |date=October 2016 |title= 1916: Guns On The Border |magazine=American Rifleman |publisher=National Rifle Association}}</ref>\n\n===World War I and interwar use===\n[[File:The US Army on the Western Front 1914-1918 Q70181.jpg|thumb|right|US Marines with M1903 rifles and bayonets in France (1918)]]\n[[File:US WWI rifle periscope attachment.jpeg|thumb|An Elder-type [[Periscope rifle|periscope stock]] fitted to an M1903 (1918).

Pre-war production utilized questionable metallurgy. Some receivers constructed of single-heat-treated case-hardened steel were improperly subjected to excessive temperatures during the forging process. The carbon could be \"burnt\" out of the steel producing a brittle receiver.<ref>''Canfield, February 2008, p. 13</ref> Despite documented evidence indicating some early rifles were improperly forged, actual cases of failure were very rare. Although several cases of serious injury from receiver failure were documented, the U.S. Army never reported any fatalities. Many failures were attributed to use of incorrect cartridges, such as the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]].<ref name=l&h>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2004 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=152 |issue=January |pages=20 }}</ref> Evidence also seems to suggest that improperly forged brass cartridge cases could have exacerbated receiver failure.<ref>''Lyon, Joseph: Some Observations On The Failure Of U.S. Model 1903 Rifle Receivers (http://m1903.com/03rcvrfail/)</ref>\n\n[[Pyrometer]]s were installed in December 1917 to accurately measure temperatures during the forging process. The change was made at approximately serial number 800,000 for rifles made at Springfield Armory and at serial number 285,507 at Rock Island Arsenal. Lower serial numbers are known as \"low-number\" M1903 rifles. Higher serial numbers are said to be \"double-heat-treated.\"<ref name=l&h/>\n\nToward the end of the war, Springfield turned out the Model 1903 Mark I. The Mark I has a cut on the left hand side of the receiver meant to act as an ejection port for the [[Pedersen Device]], a modified sear and cutoff to operate the Pedersen Device; a specialized insert that replaced the bolt and allowed the user to fire .30 caliber pistol cartridges semi-automatically from a 40-round detachable magazine. The stock was also slightly cut down on the left side to clear the ejection port. In all other respects, the Mark I is identical to the 1903. Temperature control during forging was improved prior to Mark I production. The receiver alloy was toughened by addition of nickel after Mark I production.\n\nIn 1926, after experiencing the effect of long-range German [[7.92\u00d757mm]] Mauser and machine gun fire during the war, the U.S. Army adopted the heavy 174-grain boat-tail bullet for its .30-06 cartridge, standardized as 'Cartridge, Ball, caliber 30, M1'.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\">Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', 6th ed., DBI Books Inc. (1989), p. 59</ref> M1 ammunition, intended primarily for long-range machine gun use, soon became known by Army rifle competition teams and expert riflemen for its considerably greater accuracy over that of the M1906-round; the new M1 ammunition was issued to infantrymen with the Springfield rifle as well as to machine gun teams.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunlap|first1=Roy|title=Rifles|journal=Ordnance Went up Front: Some Observations and Experiences of a Sergeant of Ordnance, Who Served Throughout World War II with the United States Army in Egypt, the Philippines and Japan, Including Way Stations|date=1948|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ordnance_Went_Up_Front.html?id=vp8QAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2015|oclc=777744849}}</ref> However, during the late 1930s, it became apparent that, with the development of mortars, high-angle artillery, and the .50 caliber [[M2 Browning]] machine gun, the need for extreme long-range, rifle-caliber machine-gun fire was decreasing. In 1938, the U.S. army reverted to a .30-06 cartridge with a 152-grain flat-base bullet, now termed [[M2 Ball]], for all rifles and machine guns.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s and the 1930s, M1903s were delivered to US allies in [[Central America]], such as [[Cuba]], [[Costa Rica]] or [[Nicaragua]].

The precision rear aperture sight was located too far from the eye for efficient use, and the narrow, unprotected front sight was both difficult to see in poor light and easily damaged. The U.S. Marine Corps issued the Springfield with a sight hood to protect the front sight, along with a thicker front blade. The two-piece firing pin/striker also proved to be no improvement over the original one-piece Mauser design, and was a cause of numerous Ordnance repairs, along with occasional reports of jammed magazine followers.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>\n[[File:American First World War Official Exchange Collection Q103350.jpg|thumb|right|Camouflaged M1903 Springfield sniper's rifle with Warner & Swasey [[telescopic sight]], in France, May 1918.]]\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] saw new production of the Springfield at private manufacturers such as the [[Remington Arms]] and [[Smith-Corona]] Typewriter companies. Remington began production of the M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the [[Rock Island Arsenal]] which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an \"R\".<ref name=bnc2>{{cite journal |last=Canfield |first=Bruce N. |year=2015 |title=Wartime Remington M1903s? |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=163 |issue=March |pages=44 }}</ref>\n \nM1903 production was discontinued in favor of the M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range elevation setting.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 302</ref> Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier machined part.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/> All stock furniture was also redesigned in stamped metal.\n\nIn late 1942, Smith-Corona Typewriter Company also began production of the M1903A3 at its plant in Syracuse, NY.<ref name=\"Brophy, William 1985 p. 187\">Brophy, William, ''The Springfield 1903 Rifles'', Stackpole Books (1985), p. 187</ref> Smith/Corona parts are mostly identified by the absence of markings. Except for occasions when time permitting during manufacture, on early to mid production rifles, and also only on certain parts.\n\n{{citation needed span|text=Smith/Corona bolts are sometimes marked with an \"X\" on top of the bolt handle root, which appears as a simple two-line \"X\". The underside of the bolt handle root, will also be marked with a inspectors inspection number, and a punch marking from the hardness testing. This \"X\" markings is often misidentified as the \"H\" marking, that is found on field replacement bolts produced by Hadley Tool co. The \"H\" marking is easily identified by its use of a cursive bubble script. Which appears to be a X at a glance, but is easily distinguishable from the Smith Corona \"X\", when compared to one another. Due to the Smith Corona \"X\" being a simple two-line X, often referred to as the \"crossed twigs\" Front sight bases are also found to be occasionally marked with a \"G\" on the side between the two pin holes used for mounting the base to the barrel, and to affix the sight blade. This \"G\" mark may also be found on the bolt/safety shroud, but hidden on an assembled bolt. This is due to it being stamped on the inner face of the shroud facing the striker/firing pin assembly, as to be hidden on an assembled bolt. The shroud is also identified by a scalloped cut on top, but this does not absolutely identify the shroud as a Smith Corona part. One must remember the machines and plans were obtained by other manufacturers after Smith Corona and ended WW2 production. This was to be done to manufacture replacement parts at the end of and post WW2. As such, these manufacturers used the designs as completed by Smith Corona. As expected shrouds and other parts will look nearly identical to Smith Corona original parts, but bear other markings. Such as, \"BP\" marked shrouds, \"CC\" marked bolt bodies, and other parts manufactured using the Smith Corona designs. The only \"S\" marking, that might be found, is found on the extractor. This marking is located on the down-facing side, when mounted on the bolt, in the same area as the dovetailed mounting point underneath the extractor when mounted. Smith Corona buttplates, are only marked by the design of the stamped checkering, which will be 9 to 10 lines per inch. As opposed to a WW2 Remington or replacement stamped 1903a3 buttplate, which consist of 16 or more lines per inch. The stamped trigger guard, is found both with the \"small early\" and \"large mid to late\" trigger bow. A Smith Corona part, however, is identified by the reinforcement stamping line directly behind the forward most action screws (sometimes referred to as the king screw). The stamped reinforcement line behind the forward screw, is shaped in a U or semicircle surrounding the rear portion of the screw. As opposed to a Remington manufactured parts straight line stamping in the same location. Rear adjustable sights appear to be of near-identical design, except for finish and the lack of identifying marks on the base or the sight itself. The rear sight has been observed being removed from original sealed WW2 packaging, and in time period photos, as to having two external finish types. Photos show very early production rear sights being completely finished in a hot caustic bluing. All other confirmed original rear sights, have been noted to have a grey phosphate finished base, and the sight itself being blued. Smith Corona rifle stocks in as new original non-rearsenaled condition, lacking a Depot or arsenal stamp with only a single circle P proof, have all been noted to have certain original as manufactured markings or proofs. The left side of the stock, on the wrist area, are marked with a boxed-in FJA inspector stamp followed by the crossed cannon arsenal stamp. The order of the stamps are reversed from Remington production stocks, and lack the RA marking (Remington Arms) preceding the other markings. Just forward of the trigger guard on the underside of the stock, are 4 inspection numbers encased in differing shapes. There may be more present, if the stock or rifle has been reworked in the past, but originally there was to be 4 inspection processes marked here. Numbers differing by inspector, the shapes they are enclosed in have been observed to the same on each original example in the same position. Left to right, top to bottom, they are as follows. Top left, number in a triangle, top right, number in a circle, bottom left, number in a square, and unique to Smith Corona stocks, bottom right, number in a diamond. Just behind the bow of the trigger guard is the P proof, that is usually present on US arms of this period and before on the bottom of the stock wrist grip. Unique to the Smith Corona, is the larger size of this proof of 7/16, when compared to a noticeably smaller Remington proof. The inlet cut for the Smith Corona stocks band spring, just forward of the rear stock band, is also of a unique rounded corners design as opposed to Remington's squared corners appearance. |reason=User:Brandon Gvt seems to have forgotten to provide a source for this new information they added|date=August 2019}} \n\nTo speed production output, two-groove rifled barrels were adopted, and steel alloy specifications were relaxed under 'War Emergency Steel' criteria for both rifle actions and barrels.<ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 362</ref> M1903A3 rifles with two-groove 'war emergency' barrels were shipped with a printed notation stating that the reduction in rifling grooves did not affect accuracy.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 301</ref>  As the war progressed, various machining and finishing operations were eliminated on the M1903A3 in order to increase production levels.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\"/>\n\nOriginal production rifles at Remington and Smith-Corona had a dark gray/black finish similar to the bluing of late World War I. Beginning in late 1943 a lighter gray/green parkerizing finish was used. This later finish was also used on arsenal repaired weapons.\nIt is somewhat unusual to find a World War I or early World War II M1903 with its original dated barrel. Much, if not all, World War II .30-06 ammunition used a corrosive primer which left corrosive salts in the barrel. If not removed by frequent and proper barrel cleaning these residues could cause pitting and excessive wear. In the jungle fighting on various Pacific islands cleaning was sometimes lax and the excessive moisture compounded the corrosive action of the residue.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bishop | first = Chris| title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II | place = New York | publisher = Orbis Publishing Ltd | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7607-1022-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe M1903 and the M1903A3 rifle were used in combat alongside the M1 Garand by the U.S. military during World War II and saw extensive use and action in the hands of U.S. troops in Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific. The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were initially armed with M1903 rifles in early battles in the Pacific, such as the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], but the jungle battle environment generally favored self-loading rifles;<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391: \"Nearly every one [Marine] I talked to [on Guadalcanal] who used the Springfield in combat-without a scope-would have much rather been using a Garand.\"</ref> later Army units arriving to the island were armed with the M1 Garand.<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391</ref> The [[U.S. Army Rangers]] were also a major user of the M1903 and the M1903A3 during World War II with the Springfield being preferred over the M1 Garand for certain commando missions.\n\nAccording to Bruce Canfield's encyclopedic ''U.S. Infantry Weapons of WW II'', final variants of the M1903 (the A3 and A4) were delivered in February 1944.<ref name=bnc2/> By then, most American combat troops had been re-equipped with the M1 Garand. However, some front-line infantry units in both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps retained M1903s as infantry rifles beyond that date and continued to use them alongside the M1 Garand until the end of the Second World War in 1945. The Springfield remained in service for [[sniper]]s (using the '''M1903A4'''), [[grenadier]]s (using a spigot type rifle [[22 mm grenade|22 mm] with the M1 grenade launcher] [[grenade launcher]] until the M7 grenade launcher was available for the M1 rifle in late 1943), and Marine [[Scout Sniper]] units.\n\n==== Sniper rifle====\nThe M1903A4 was the U.S. Army's sniper rifle of choice during the Second World War. The M1903A4 was a variation of the M1903A3. The only difference between receivers was that the model and serial number on the receiver were split on 1903A4 to make room for the Redfield scope mount. The Redfield scope mount removed the rear peep sight that was standard on the M1903A3. The scope used on the M1903A4 was a Weaver Model 330 or 330C, which was a 2.75x telescopic sight. The receivers were tested by Remington Arms and those that were deemed best, meaning those closest to design specifications were selected to become M1903A4's. The barrels were also selected specifically to be added to the M1903A4 rifle only if they were within almost exact specifications for the design. The front sight on the barrel was never installed on the A4 barrels, however, the notch for it was still in place. .<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>  Barrel specifications were, in general, unchanged between the M1903A3 and M1903A4, however, the War Department did start installing barrels with 2 groove rifling instead of 4 groove, despite the lack of clear changes from the 4 groove rifling that was the standard up until 1942.<ref>George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392</ref>\n\nBy some accounts, the M1903A4 was inadequate as a sniper rifle. The M1903A4 was a relatively accurate rifle with an effective range of about 600 yards (550m). These limitations on long-range targeting were due to the limited field of view present in both the M73 and M73B1 scopes. From its adoption in 1943 until the end of the war it was used extensively in every theater of operation by both the US Army and the USMC.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\">George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392\u2013393</ref> The Weaver scopes (later standardized as the M73 and M73B1) were not only low-powered in magnification, they were not waterproofed, and frequently fogged over or became waterlogged during humidity changes. In addition, the M81/82 optional scopes also had significant flaws. They most notably had less power (2.2x vs. 2.75x) and, like the other scopes on the M1903A4, had serious issues with the field of view.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/><ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\"/><ref>George, John (Lt.

Various U.S. allies and friendly irregular forces were also equipped with the weapon. The [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] (FEB), operating in the 5th Army in Italy was equipped with Springfield M1903 rifles. In August 1943, the [[Free French Forces]] of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] were re-equipped by the United States primarily with M1903A3 Springfield and [[M1917 Enfield Rifle]]s.

Still, some M1903A4s remained in sniper use as late as the Vietnam War; and technical manuals for them were printed as late as 1970.<ref name=y03s/> The U.S. Navy also continued to carry some stocks of M1903A3s on board ships, for use as anti-mine rifles.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:USMC-120801-M-VG714-002.jpg|thumb|M1903 Springfield used during a vintage sniper rifle match in 2012]]\n\nDue to its balance, it is still popular with various military drill teams and color guards, most notably the U.S. Army Drill Team.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} M1903 rifles (along with the M1 Garand, M1917 Enfield and M14 rifles) are also common at [[high school]] [[Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (JROTC) units to teach weapons handling and military drill procedures to the cadets. JROTC units use M1903s for regular and inter-school competition drills, including elaborate exhibition spinning routines. Exhibition teams often use fiberglass stocks in place of wooden stocks, which are heavier and more prone to breakage when dropped. JROTC Color Guards still favor wooden stocks over fiberglass because of their weight characteristics and appearance. The M1903 is also the standard parade rifle of the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]], which has over six hundred M1903s, a very small percentage of which are still fireable. The Summerall Guards of The Citadel South Carolina Corps of Cadets in Charleston, S.C. also use the Springfield 1903 model for their silent drill performances, which include annual trips to [[Mardi Gras]], as well as many other notable performances.\n\nContemporary hunters and shooting enthusiasts value the rifle for its beauty, dependability, and adaptability for almost all U.S. game animals.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps]] color guard rifles bear many similarities to the Springfield.\n\n\nIn 1977, the Army located a rather large cache of unissued M1903A3 rifles which were demilitarized and then issued to JROTC units as a replacement for their previously issued [[M1 Garand]] and [[M14 rifle|M14]] rifles, which were then returned to Army custody due to concerns about potential break-ins at high school JROTC armories.\n\nFor safety reasons, the JROTC M1903s are made permanently unable to fire by plugging the barrel with a steel rod, or having it filled with lead, soldering the bolt and welding the magazine cutoff switch in the ON position.  To plug the barrel, a very cold steel rod was inserted; after it warmed up it was too tight to remove.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Caliber 30 Springfield Rifle.JPG|thumb|Diagram of the .30 Springfield Rifle]]\nThe U.S. rifle, Model of 1903 was 44\u215e&nbsp;inches (1.098&nbsp;m) long and weighed 8&nbsp;[[Avoirdupois|lb]] 11&nbsp;oz (3.95&nbsp;kg). A bayonet could be attached; the [[M1905 bayonet]] blade was 16&nbsp;in (406&nbsp;mm) long and weighed 1&nbsp;lb (0.45&nbsp;kg). From 1906, the rifle was chambered to fire the .30-[[caliber]] M1906 [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] (.30-06 cartridge), later the M1 (1926) and [[M2 Ball]] (1938) rounds. There were four standard types of cartridge:\n\n* '''Ball''': consisted of a brass case or shell, primer, a charge of smokeless powder, and the bullet. The bullet had a sharp point called a [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]], and was composed of a lead core and a jacket of [[cupro-nickel]] (later gilding metal), and in the M1906 design, weighed 150&nbsp;[[Grain (measure)|grains]] (9.7&nbsp;g). The bullet of the M1906 cartridge, when fired from the rifle, had an initial velocity of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Blank''': contained a paper cup instead of a bullet. It is dangerous up to {{convert|33|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Guard''': had a smaller charge of powder than the ball cartridge, and five [[cannelure]]s encircle the body of the shell at about the middle to distinguish it from ball cartridges. It was intended for use on guard or in riot duty, and it gave good results up to {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The range of {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} required a sight elevation of {{convert|450|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and the range of {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} required an elevation of {{convert|645|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Dummy''': this was tin-plated and the shell was provided with six longitudinal corrugations and three circular holes. The primer contains no percussion composition. It was intended for drill purposes to accustom the soldier to the operation of loading the rifle.\n\nThe rifle was sighted for {{convert|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} and had a point-blank range of {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The maximum range of the ball cartridge, when elevated at an angle of 45\u00b0, was {{convert|4890|yd|km mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rifle was a magazine-fed clip-loader and could fire at a rate of 20 shots per minute. Each [[stripper clip]] contained five cartridges, and standard issue consisted of 12 clips carried in a cloth bandoleer. When full the [[bandoleer]] weighed about {{convert|3|lb|14|oz|kg|abbr=on}}. Bandoleers were packed 20 in a box, for a total of 1,200 rounds. The full box weighed {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe bore of the rifle is 0.30&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;mm) in diameter. It was then rifled 0.004&nbsp;in (0.1&nbsp;mm) deep, making the diameter from the bottom of one groove to the bottom of the opposite groove 0.30787 in (7.82&nbsp;mm) of the barrel.\n\nThe 1903 rifle included a rear sight leaf that could be used to adjust for elevation. When the leaf was flat, the battle sight appeared on top. This sight was set for {{convert|547|yd|abbr=on}}, and was not adjustable. When the leaf was raised it could be adjusted to a maximum extreme range of {{convert|2850|yd|abbr=on}}. The rear sight could also be adjusted for windage.\n\nThe 1903A3 rear sight was an aperture sight adjustable both for elevation and windage.\n\nA feature inherent to the M1903 and not found on the [[Gewehr 98|Mauser 98]] is the cocking piece, a conspicuous knob at the rear of the bolt, allowing the rifle's striker to be released without dry firing, or to cock the rifle if necessary, for example to attempt a second strike on a round that failed to fire.\n\n==Variants==\nThere were four main variants given official nomenclature, though there are a number of important sub-variants:\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A3]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903 with 'scant' [[Stock (firearm)|stock]]]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A4 with M84 sight.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A4 with Type C stock and M84 sight]]\n*'''M1903 (1903)''': developed for the [[.30-03]] (also known as the .30-45) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].

Production barrels were measured with star-gauges, and those meeting specified tolerances were stamped with an asterisk shaped star on the muzzle crown. These barrels were fitted to selected receivers with hand-fitted and polished parts. The bolt was left unblued while the receiver and barrel were finished with a black Parkerizing process. Some bolts have the safety direction reversed to prevent it from striking the nose of a right-handed shooter, and those made from 1924 to 1929 have the knurled cocking piece removed to decrease lock time. Early rifles used the type S stock until the type C stock became standard in 1929. Rifles made for sale to NRA members (priced at $40.44) were drilled and tapped for a Lyman 48 receiver sight and had either a type B (or NB) stock with no grasping grooves and a noticeable drop at the heel for a long pistol grip, or a special National Match stock with a high comb and pistol grip. Total production was 28,907. Most were issued to service teams and 25,377 were reconditioned at Springfield armory after one year of match use. Reconditioned rifles have a large gas-escape port drilled into the left side of the receiver.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Norell |first1=James O.E. |year=2003 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=151 |issue=July |pages=38\u201341 }}</ref>\n**'''M1903 Bushmaster carbine (1940s)''': the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] and stock were cut down {{convert|18|in|mm}} for easier use in [[Panama]]; 4,725 such rifles were made. It was a training rifle and saw no action. After World War II most were dumped into the ocean and surviving pieces are rare.\n**'''M1903 with 'scant' stock (1942)''': in late 1941, before the 1903A3 was standardized, Army Ordnance wanted to standardize on a pistol-grip stock for all M1903 rifles. There were thousands of stock blanks that had been sized for the old straight stock. They weren't deep enough for the full pistol grip of the Type C stock, so they were modified to allow a \"scant\" grip that was the largest grip they could form. These \"scant\" stocks would only fit on a 1903, and would not fit an 03A3. Springfield only rebuilt existing M1903 rifles using this stock in 1942 and marked the cut-off seat with a small \"s\".\n[[File:1930 Springfield 1903A1.JPG|thumb|Springfield 1903A1 rifle]]\n*'''M1903A1 (1929\u20131939)''': changed from a straight stock to a pistol grip type stock (Type C stock). The pistol grip stock was conducive to improved marksmanship and was fitted to National Match rifles until World War II. Pistol grip stocks became standard for later M1903 production and were subsequently fitted to older rifles. The Army considered any rifle with a pistol grip stock an M1903A1, but M1903 receiver markings were unchanged.<ref name=bnc>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2007 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]]|issue=January |pages=38 }}</ref>\n*'''M1903A2 (1930s\u20131940s)''': basically a stripped A1 or A3 used as a subcaliber rifle with artillery pieces.\n*'''M1903A3 (1942\u20131944)''': sights were changed to an aperture (peep) system mounted on the receiver, and the rifle was modified for easier production with stamped metal parts and somewhat different grip and stock (late model Type S stock; no finger grooves).\n**'''M1903 (Modified) (1941\u20131942)''': Transition production of M1903 rifles by Remington Arms until the M1903A3 design was implemented involved modification of various parts creating a hybrid between the M1903 and M1903A3.<ref name=bnc2/>\n*'''M1903A4 (1942)''': an M1903A3 modified to be a sniper rifle using an M73 or M73B1 2.5\u00d7 Weaver [[telescopic sight]] and different stock, and omitting the iron sights. USMC versions instead used the 8x Unertl scope.\n\nThere are two main other types, various training types, and competition versions such as the [[National Match]] types. Aside from these there are some other civilian versions, experimental versions, and other miscellaneous types. Due to the duration of its service, there is also a range of smaller differences among ones from different periods and manufacturers.\n\nIn military use it was outnumbered by the [[M1917 Enfield]] for much of the war. Also, during World War II many remained in use early on, especially in the Pacific (generally replaced as M1s became available), in addition to service (along with other weapons) as a sniper rifle and to launch [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\n*'''Bannerman Springfields''': At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Scottish-born [[military surplus]] magnate, [[Pollepel Island#Francis Bannerman VI|Francis Bannerman VI (1851\u20131918)]], assembled 1,000 M1903 rifles from surplus parts which were rebored to accept [[.303 British|British .303]] ammunition.  These he presented to the [[British Army]] together with the associated bayonets, pouches and webbing, as a patriotic gesture. Unfortunately, the conversion was not a success and it was found that the rimmed .303 cartridge would not feed properly from the magazine.<ref>Ian D.
