The school was originally founded in 1909 by The Rev. George P. Mayo, an [[Episcopalian]] clergyman, as the '''Blue Ridge Industrial School,''' a school for the rural mountain students living in the region. It closed in 1960. The Blue Ridge School of today opened in 1962 as an all-boys boarding college prep school. Approximately 185 students attend Blue Ridge from 27 states and 15 foreign countries, with many from Virginia and other Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. The school's campus is <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">751&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(3&nbsp;km\u00b2)</span> in [[Greene County, Virginia]], adjoining Brokenback Mountain at the edge of [[Shenandoah National Park]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The campus features a picturesque lake, miles of hiking and bike trails and rustic local stone buildings. The headmaster is William \"Trip\" Darren, since 2012.<ref name=history/> \n\n==History==\n\nAfter two years of information gathering and preparation, the Blue Ridge Industrial School was founded by Reverend George Pickett Mayo in 1909 as a coeducational [[vocational school]], and opened in January 1910 with about 35 students; two students graduated at the first commencement in 1918. Enrollment rose to 112 in 1922 and 165 in 1928. The first building was Neve Hall; the school lost buildings to fires in 1911, 1918, and 1962, when the first infirmary was destroyed, and was hit by a tornado on September 30, 1959. Mayo served as Superintendent until 1944. Blue Ridge became a college preparatory school for boys in 1962, with a short-term reduction of the student body to 66.<ref name=history>[https://www.blueridgeschool.com/about-us/history \"History\"], Blue Ridge School, retrieved 2018-04-28.</ref>\n\nThe original <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">148&nbsp;acre&nbsp;(0.6&nbsp;km\u00b2)</span> campus, located <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">20&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(32&nbsp;km)</span> from Charlottesville, Virginia, sits at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
