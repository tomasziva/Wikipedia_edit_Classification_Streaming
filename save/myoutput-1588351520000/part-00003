Locke]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Ladies in Lavender'' is set in picturesque coastal [[Cornwall]], in a tight-knit fishing village in 1936. A gifted young [[Poland|Polish]] violinist from [[Krak\u00f3w]], Andrea is sailing to America when he is swept overboard from his ship in a storm. When the Widdington sisters, Janet and Ursula, discover the handsome stranger washed up on the beach below their house, they nurse him back to health. However, the presence of the musically talented young man disrupts the peaceful lives of the sisters and the community in which they live.\n\nHolidaying artist Olga Danilof, the sister of famed violinist Boris Danilof, becomes interested in Andrea after hearing him play the violin. Olga writes a letter to the sisters, telling them who she is and that she would like to introduce her brother to Andrea. Instead of giving him the letter, understanding her sister has feelings for Andrea, Janet burns it. As time progresses, Olga and Andrea grow closer, and one day Andrea angrily confronts the sisters about the letter. Andrea, realizing that Ursula has feelings for him, apologizes for getting angry and they reconcile.\n\nOlga tells her brother of Andrea's talent, and he asks to meet Andrea in London. When Andrea meets with Olga to discuss the letter from her brother, she tells him that they must leave on a train immediately because her brother is only in London for 24 hours. Although Andrea cares deeply for the sisters, he knows this is his chance to start a career, and he leaves with Olga without saying goodbye. The sisters, worried that something has happened to him, call a friend of Andrea's who tells them he saw Andrea and Olga getting on a train. Thinking she'll never see him again, Ursula is heartbroken and Janet consoles her as best as she can. Andrea later sends them a letter, along with a portrait of himself painted by Olga, thanking them for saving his life. The sisters travel to London to attend Andrea's first public performance in Britain, while the rest of the village listens in on the wireless.\n\n== Principal cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Judi Dench]] as Ursula Widdington\n*[[Maggie Smith]] as Janet Widdington\n*[[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Andrea Marowski\n*[[Natascha McElhone]] as Olga Danilof\n*[[Miriam Margolyes]] as Dorcas\n*[[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Dr. Mead\n*[[Toby Jones]] as Hedley\n*[[Freddie Jones]] as Jan Pendered\n*[[Clive Russell]] as Adam Penruddocke\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n[[William John Locke|William Locke's]] original story was first published on 26 December 1908 in ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine, Vol.42, later appearing in book form in his short-story collection ''Faraway Stories'' (1916).\n\nThe film marked the directorial debut of actor [[Charles Dance]].

Elder awarded the film two out of a possible four stars and added:\n\n<blockquote>[it] exemplifies that kind of polite, underdramatic ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' staging that can either provide a surgical examination of English society or bore the pants off you. ''Ladies in Lavender'' does a bit of both... director Dance's momentum fades soon after Andrea's ankle mends, and we're left with a vague back story involving Andrea's intent to emigrate to America, though the mystery of how he ended up in Cornwall is never revisited nor revealed. [He] becomes sort of a blank character, a personality on whom we can impose our own curiosity and emotions... as compelling and original as this theme is, it's not enough to keep our attention, no matter how lovely the ladies in lavender are.\"<ref>[http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-ladies-in/159570/content ''Chicago Tribune'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219080211/http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-ladies-in/159570/content |date=19 February 2009 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://film.britishcouncil.org/ladies-in-lavender  ''Ladies in Lavender''] at [[British Council|British Council\u2013Film]]\n*[http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b89a85fec  ''Ladies in Lavender''] at [[British Film Institute|BFI]]\n*[http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=22541  ''Ladies in Lavender''] at [[LUMIERE]]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0377084|title=Ladies in Lavender}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|ladies_in_lavender}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220100206/http://www.dvdtown.com/news/on-ladies-in-lavender/2701 Interview with Charles Dance]\n*[http://www.charlesdance.co.uk/lavender_blues.html Charles Dance's ''Ladies in Lavender'' diary]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090219000613/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/Ladies_in_Lavender.html ''Ladies in Lavender'' at the Tribeca Film Festival Website]\n*[https://www.variety.com/profiles/Film/main/167881/Ladies%20in%20Lavender.html?dataSet=1 ''Ladies in Lavender'' at Variety.com]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ladies In Lavender}}\n[[Category:2000s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:British historical drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about sisters]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in England]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Charles Dance]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Elizabeth Karlsen]]\n[[Category:Number 9 Films films]]\n[[Category:2004 directorial debut films]]\n", "name_user": "Gazamp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:AddedPortal:Cornwall", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_in_Lavender"}
