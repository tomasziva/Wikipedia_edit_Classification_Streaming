Matthews, Terrence \"Dresser\" Williams, and Eddie [https://twitter.com/Robert_Townsend/status/843927668907159552 King] Jr. perform at a [[Battle of the Bands]] contest as The Heartbeats. The group loses to Flash and the Ebony Sparks but pleases the crowd and is noticed by Jimmy Potter. Jimmy offers to manage the group, promising them $100 if they do not win the next month's Battle of the Bands contest. After the group loses, Jimmy pays them. When the owner of the club asks to hire them, they agree to let Jimmy manage them.\n\nBird and The Midnight Falcons witness the Heartbeats rehearsing for a competition and are concerned they could lose; frontman Victor \"Bird\" Thomas asks his girlfriend to invite her friends and boo The Heartbeats while cheering The Falcons. The announcer, a cousin of one of the Falcons, forces The Heartbeats to use the house piano player. Duck grows frustrated with the house player's poor playing, and shoves him off the piano stool. Eddie leads the group in a number that results in Bird's girlfriend fainting in Eddie's arms. The Heartbeats win the contest and the interest of Big Red Davis, who owns Big Red Records. Big Red offers them a deal, but Jimmy and his wife Eleanor, aware of Big Red's corruption, decline. The group instead releases their first single on Jimmy's own [[independent record label|independent label]] and searches for a record company they can trust, but no one else is interested aside from a label which wants to buy Duck's songs for a group they've already signed, The Five Horsemen, prompting the Heartbeats to sign with Big Red.\n\nThe group goes on the road, but the travel is marred by racism and poor living conditions. Dresser's girlfriend visits and reveals she is pregnant, and the group is faced with their first album cover featuring white people, despite the label having earlier approved a photo of the Heartbeats as the cover.\n\nThroughout the mid-to-late 1960s The Five Heartbeats receive numerous awards, chart several hits, and are featured on magazine covers. Eddie, however, starts abusing [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]], affecting his performance and prompting his girlfriend Baby Doll to break up with him. Convinced that Jimmy intends to replace him due to his deteriorating condition, he cuts a deal with Big Red to have Jimmy cut out of his contract. In retaliation, Jimmy threatens to go to the authorities with information about [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged LPs]], cooked books, and [[payola]] that could have Big Red arrested, leading Red to have Jimmy killed in a hit disguised as an accident. Soon after Jimmy's funeral, the group learns that Eddie's deceit caused the fallout between Jimmy and Big Red. Big Red is eventually convicted of Jimmy's murder, forcing the group to sign with a new record label, and causing a guilt-ridden Eddie to leave in disgrace. Eddie later turns up at several Heartbeats concerts to try to convince his friends to let him back into the group, but his substance abuse has taken its toll on him by this time, and all the other Heartbeats can do is supply him with money out of sympathy; Duck later hears on the radio that Eddie was involved in an armed robbery and, after a shootout with the police, was in critical condition.\n\nThe Heartbeats add Flash as their lead singer. Duck comes to suspect his fianc\u00e9, Tanya Sawyer, is having an affair with Choirboy. He follows her to a hotel, only to discover that Tanya is meeting with J.T., not Choirboy. Tanya's relationship with J.T. predates her relationship with Duck, but she says she is now in love with Duck. J.T. urges Tanya to disclose the affair, but she refuses. At an awards ceremony celebrating their success, Flash announces he is going solo. Duck reveals that he knows about Tanya and J.T. and also leaves the group, resulting in the Heartbeats' disbandment.\n\nThe film then skips ahead to the early 1990s. Choirboy, true to his nickname, has returned to singing in his father's church. After converting to Christianity, Eddie has since become clean and sober. He is now married to Baby Doll, sings in Choirboy's choir, and manages a group. He asks Duck to write songs for them, to which Duck agrees. J.T. has a wife and two children, including a son named \"Duck\". The brothers reconcile. The only member to have maintained a singing career is Flash, who transitioned from [[doo-wop]] to [[pop music]], and is part of the group Flash and The Five Horsemen.\n\nAt a family gathering, Eleanor Potter, coming to terms with her husband's death, forgives Eddie. The Five Heartbeats reunite in front of their families and friends, as they try to show off their old moves.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===The Five Heartbeats===\n*[[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] as Donald \"Duck\" Matthews: Duck hails from a poor family.  He is The Five Heartbeats' co-founder and brother of fellow Heartbeat's member J.T. Matthews, and originally was only the composer and musician for the group. He is a permanent vocalist after Bobby disappears. He serves as the movie's narrator, with the film beginning as he reminisces about the group's career.\n*[[Leon Robinson]] as J.T. Matthews: J.T. is the older brother of Duck. A womanizer; he and his brother Duck share a close and sometimes turbulent relationship. \n*[[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]] as Eddie King, Jr.: Eddie comes from an area that features predominantly poor individuals, his own father believing his attempts to start a career in the music industry will be unsuccessful. He is one of the founding members of The Heartbeats and serves as the crowd pleaser whose voice leads to success in many of their performances. Similar to [[David Ruffin]], Eddie is the lead vocalist of the band and falls into a life of drugs and alcohol that eventually leads to his expulsion from the group as well as emotional trauma. After hitting rock-bottom several times, he eventually converts to Christianity, cleans and sobers himself up, marries his longtime sweetheart Baby Doll, and manages his own group.\n*\n*[[Tico Wells]] as Anthony \"Choirboy\" Stone: Stone is given the nickname \"Choirboy\" (much to his chagrin) for his past as a choir boy in his father's church. Similar to Eddie, Stone's father does not support his decision to become a music artist fearing rock and jazz are \"the devil's music.\" He becomes more of a womanizer as the group becomes more successful, but later goes back to being a part of his father's ministry after the group disbands.\n*[[Harry Lennix|Harry J. Lennix]] as Terrence \"Dresser\" Williams: The original choreographer of The Heartbeats, Dresser serves as the groups bass singer and one of the founding members.

When Eddie goes into a downward spiral, Flash is brought in as the new lead singer.\n*[[Roy Fegan]] as Victor \"Bird\" Thomas: Bird is the lead singer of Bird and The Midnight Falcons. Early in the film the character attempts to defeat The Five Heartbeats in a vocal contest. After Big Red orchestrates the murder of Jimmy Potter, Bird, who was previously attacked and intimidated by Big Red during a party, joins members of the Heartbeats in testifying against Red and helps to convict him of the murder.\n*[[Harold Nicholas]] of [[The Nicholas Brothers]] as Ernest \"Sarge\" Johnson: Johnson is The Five Heartbeat's choreographer. Sarge is last seen in the hospital on his birthday.\n*[[Troy Beyer]] as Baby Doll: Eddie's girlfriend, who leaves him after he abuses drugs and alcohol. She later marries Eddie and they are shown singing together in a choir.\n*[[Theresa Randle]] as Brenda Williams: Dresser's girlfriend, who later becomes his wife. She and Dresser have a daughter named Monica.\n*[[Lamont Johnson]] as Bobby Cassanova: Bobby and Eddie are the original co-lead singers of the group.

Bobby gets shot in the leg and is replaced by Eddie as the lead singer.\n*Carla Brothers as Tanya Sawyer: Duck's love interest. His earlier attempts to win her heart are unsuccessful but they reconnect at a party for the group and later date. Tanya and Duck were set to be wed, but Duck's suspicion about Tanya and Choir Boy had him follow her to a hotel only to find out that his brother J.T. was the one seeing her. This led Duck to estrange himself from the Heartbeats and his brother for years. \n*Tressa Thomas as \"Duck's Little Sister\": Clara Matthews, Duck's little sister, was also his muse, often helping him compose and arrange songs for the group as they did household chores. She was instrumental in arranging the vocals for \"We Haven't Finished Yet\".\n\n===Other bands===\n*Bird and The Midnight Falcons portrayed by actors Roy Fegan, Gregory Alexander, Roger Rose, Jimmy Woodard: The group The Five Heartbeats compete against in their second onscreen performance. The Midnight Falcons attempt to cheat by ordering their girlfriends to deliberately cheer against The Heartbeats. They would later sign with Big Red Records along with the Five Heartbeats.\n*Flash and the Ebony Sparks portrayed by John Canada Terrell, Ron Jackson, Recoe Walker and Wayne \"Crescendo\" Ward: The Ebony Sparks defeat The Five Heartbeats in singing competitions\u2014many of which are rigged\u2014prior to their mainstream popularity. Flash later becomes the lead singer for the Five Heartbeats.\n\n==Production==\nAfter writing (along with [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]), producing, directing, and starring in his first film ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'', Robert Townsend had attained near-cult status among independent filmmakers due to his dedication to that film\u2014a project which caused him to max out all his credit cards and spend nearly $100,000 of his own money raised through savings and various acting jobs in order to produce the film. When writing Townsend's first studio film ''The Five Heartbeats'', Townsend and Wayans kept comedy an important aspect of the film, but also explored complex characters in a more dramatic way.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">https://books.google.com/books?id=5YWgxVkJmT4C&pg=PA220&dq=the+five+heartbeats&lr=&sig=ACfU3U0Nl-quxN9UYyRjd5Q6i_fBRfUcNw#PPA220,M1</ref>\n\n''The Five Heartbeats'' was originally set up as a development deal at [[Warner Bros.]] in 1988, with Keenan Ivory Wayans, his brother [[Damon Wayans|Damon]], and others tapped to star.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\">{{cite AV media | people=Townsend, Robert (Director) | date=August 27, 2018 | title = Making The Five Heartbeats | medium=Motion picture | location=Hollywood | publisher=Green Lighthouse}}</ref> Warner passed on the project, and the Wayans moved on to develop and star in the [[FOX Broadcasting|Fox]] sketch comedy show ''[[In Living Color]]'' instead.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" />\n\nTownsend resurrected ''Heartbeats'' at [[20th Century Fox]] in 1990.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> The original screenplay had been inspired by the lives and careers of Motown group [[The Temptations]], and Townsend had met with former lead singers [[David Ruffin]] and [[Eddie Kendricks|Eddie Kendrick]] <!--not a typo, at this time, Kendrick was going by his birth name without the \"s\" at the end--> with the intention of hiring them as technical advisors.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> Fox vetoed bringing Ruffin and Kendrick onto the production,  for fear that Motown founder [[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] might sue the studio.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> [[Rhythm and blues]]-singing group [[The Dells]], who were renowned for their four-decade career, became the technical advisors instead.\n\nTownsend used his film to depict a similar story to the careers of the Temptations and the Dells, following the lives of three friends who aspire to musical stardom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_heartbeats/#</ref> Given the setting of the film, he was able to tie in other elements, such as [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]], as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDue to the production's budgetary constraints, Townsend used little-known actors of the time, with the exceptions of [[Leon Robinson]], [[Diahann Carroll]] and [[Harold Nicholas]] of [[The Nicholas Brothers]].<ref name=\"vh1.com\">http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/11969/castcrew.jhtml</ref> Townsend had considered Denzel Washington as Eddie Kane, Jr. and [[Whitney Houston]] as Baby Doll.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> The former was not cast due to budget concerns and the latter passed on the role as it was felt to be too small.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" />\n\n===Promotion===\nTo promote the film prior to its release, Townsend, along with the other actors who portrayed the fictional musical quartet The Five Heartbeats ([[Leon Robinson]], [[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]], [[Harry Lennix|Harry J.

Dresser's girlfriend visits and reveals she is pregnant, and the group is faced with their first album cover featuring white people, despite the label having earlier approved a photo of the Heartbeats as the cover.\n\nThroughout the mid-to-late 1960s The Five Heartbeats receive numerous awards, chart several hits, and are featured on magazine covers. Eddie, however, starts abusing [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]], affecting his performance and prompting his girlfriend Baby Doll to break up with him. Convinced that Jimmy intends to replace him due to his deteriorating condition, he cuts a deal with Big Red to have Jimmy cut out of his contract. In retaliation, Jimmy threatens to go to the authorities with information about [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged LPs]], cooked books, and [[payola]] that could have Big Red arrested, leading Red to have Jimmy killed in a hit disguised as an accident. Soon after Jimmy's funeral, the group learns that Eddie's deceit caused the fallout between Jimmy and Big Red. Big Red is eventually convicted of Jimmy's murder, forcing the group to sign with a new record label, and causing a guilt-ridden Eddie to leave in disgrace. Eddie later turns up at several Heartbeats concerts to try to convince his friends to let him back into the group, but his substance abuse has taken its toll on him by this time, and all the other Heartbeats can do is supply him with money out of sympathy; Duck later hears on the radio that Eddie was involved in an armed robbery and, after a shootout with the police, was in critical condition.\n\nThe Heartbeats add Flash as their lead singer. Duck comes to suspect his fianc\u00e9, Tanya Sawyer, is having an affair with Choirboy. He follows her to a hotel, only to discover that Tanya is meeting with J.T., not Choirboy. Tanya's relationship with J.T. predates her relationship with Duck, but she says she is now in love with Duck. J.T. urges Tanya to disclose the affair, but she refuses. At an awards ceremony celebrating their success, Flash announces he is going solo. Duck reveals that he knows about Tanya and J.T. and also leaves the group, resulting in the Heartbeats' disbandment.\n\nThe film then skips ahead to the early 1990s. Choirboy, true to his nickname, has returned to singing in his father's church. After converting to Christianity, Eddie has since become clean and sober. He is now married to Baby Doll, sings in Choirboy's choir, and manages a group. He asks Duck to write songs for them, to which Duck agrees. J.T. has a wife and two children, including a son named \"Duck\". The brothers reconcile. The only member to have maintained a singing career is Flash, who transitioned from [[doo-wop]] to [[pop music]], and is part of the group Flash and The Five Horsemen.\n\nAt a family gathering, Eleanor Potter, coming to terms with her husband's death, forgives Eddie. The Five Heartbeats reunite in front of their families and friends, as they try to show off their old moves.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===The Five Heartbeats===\n*[[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] as Donald \"Duck\" Matthews: Duck hails from a poor family.

When writing Townsend's first studio film ''The Five Heartbeats'', Townsend and Wayans kept comedy an important aspect of the film, but also explored complex characters in a more dramatic way.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">https://books.google.com/books?id=5YWgxVkJmT4C&pg=PA220&dq=the+five+heartbeats&lr=&sig=ACfU3U0Nl-quxN9UYyRjd5Q6i_fBRfUcNw#PPA220,M1</ref>\n\n''The Five Heartbeats'' was originally set up as a development deal at [[Warner Bros.]] in 1988, with Keenan Ivory Wayans, his brother [[Damon Wayans|Damon]], and others tapped to star.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\">{{cite AV media | people=Townsend, Robert (Director) | date=August 27, 2018 | title = Making The Five Heartbeats | medium=Motion picture | location=Hollywood | publisher=Green Lighthouse}}</ref> Warner passed on the project, and the Wayans moved on to develop and star in the [[FOX Broadcasting|Fox]] sketch comedy show ''[[In Living Color]]'' instead.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" />\n\nTownsend resurrected ''Heartbeats'' at [[20th Century Fox]] in 1990.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> The original screenplay had been inspired by the lives and careers of Motown group [[The Temptations]], and Townsend had met with former lead singers [[David Ruffin]] and [[Eddie Kendricks|Eddie Kendrick]] <!--not a typo, at this time, Kendrick was going by his birth name without the \"s\" at the end--> with the intention of hiring them as technical advisors.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> Fox vetoed bringing Ruffin and Kendrick onto the production,  for fear that Motown founder [[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] might sue the studio.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> [[Rhythm and blues]]-singing group [[The Dells]], who were renowned for their four-decade career, became the technical advisors instead.\n\nTownsend used his film to depict a similar story to the careers of the Temptations and the Dells, following the lives of three friends who aspire to musical stardom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_heartbeats/#</ref> Given the setting of the film, he was able to tie in other elements, such as [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]], as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDue to the production's budgetary constraints, Townsend used little-known actors of the time, with the exceptions of [[Leon Robinson]], [[Diahann Carroll]] and [[Harold Nicholas]] of [[The Nicholas Brothers]].<ref name=\"vh1.com\">http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/11969/castcrew.jhtml</ref> Townsend had considered Denzel Washington as Eddie Kane, Jr. and [[Whitney Houston]] as Baby Doll.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" /> The former was not cast due to budget concerns and the latter passed on the role as it was felt to be too small.<ref name=\"5HBDocu\" />\n\n===Promotion===\nTo promote the film prior to its release, Townsend, along with the other actors who portrayed the fictional musical quartet The Five Heartbeats ([[Leon Robinson]], [[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]], [[Harry Lennix|Harry J.
