During a concert, Psy admonished the Iraqi kidnappers, condemned South Korea's former president [[Roh Moo-hyun]], and also sang along to lyrics of the song \"Dear American\" by South Korean rock band [[N.EX.T]], which criticizes the United States military for its actions in the Iraq war.<ref name=\"Fisher\">{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Gangnam Nationalism: Why Psy's anti-American rap shouldn't surprise you|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/07/gangnam-nationalism-why-psys-anti-american-rap-shouldnt-surprise-you/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}</ref> An initial translation of the lyrics was posted by an iReporter onto CNN's [[iReport]] site.<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|last=Imam|first=Jareen|title=PSY apologizes for viral anti-American lyrics|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/07/showbiz/psy-apology-irpt/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 8, 2012|date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> Some of the lyrics, referring to the guards who tortured Iraqi prisoners, were translated by CNN as follows: \"Kill those fucking Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives and those who ordered them to torture\" and \"Kill [the Yankees'] daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers / Kill them all slowly and painfully.\"<ref name=\"cnn\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Obama to attend PSY performance despite protests|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/obama-attend-psy-performance-despite-protests|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA few days later ''[[The Washington Post]]'' raised questions about the accuracy of the translation of the lyrics into English, which originated from [[CNN]]'s citizen journalism initiative iReport.

During a concert, Psy admonished the Iraqi kidnappers, condemned South Korea's former president [[Roh Moo-hyun]], and also sang along to lyrics of the song \"Dear American\" by South Korean rock band [[N.EX.T]], which criticizes the United States military for its actions in the Iraq war.<ref name=\"Fisher\">{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Gangnam Nationalism: Why Psy's anti-American rap shouldn't surprise you|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/07/gangnam-nationalism-why-psys-anti-american-rap-shouldnt-surprise-you/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}</ref> An initial translation of the lyrics was posted by an iReporter onto CNN's [[iReport]] site.<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|last=Imam|first=Jareen|title=PSY apologizes for viral anti-American lyrics|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/07/showbiz/psy-apology-irpt/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 8, 2012|date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> Some of the lyrics, referring to the guards who tortured Iraqi prisoners, were translated by CNN as follows: \"Kill those fucking Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives and those who ordered them to torture\" and \"Kill [the Yankees'] daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers / Kill them all slowly and painfully.\"<ref name=\"cnn\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Obama to attend PSY performance despite protests|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/obama-attend-psy-performance-despite-protests|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA few days later ''[[The Washington Post]]'' raised questions about the accuracy of the translation of the lyrics into English, which originated from [[CNN]]'s citizen journalism initiative iReport.
