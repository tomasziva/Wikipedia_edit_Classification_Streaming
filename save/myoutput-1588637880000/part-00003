While frugivores and fruit-producing plant species are present worldwide, there is some evidence that tropical forests have more frugivore seed dispersers than the temperate zones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} \n\n===Ecological significance===\nFrugivore seed dispersal is a common phenomenon in many ecosystems. However, it is not a highly specific type of plant\u2013animal interaction.
