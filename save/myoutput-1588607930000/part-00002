The car may also automatically swerve out of the way to prevent a collision.\n\n==== Visualization ====\nAutopilot includes a video display of (some of) what it sees around it. It displays driving lanes and vehicles in front, behind and on either side of it (in other lanes). It also sees lane markings and speed limits (via its maps). On HW3, it displays stop signs and traffic signals.  It distinguishes pedestrians, bicyclists/motorcyclists, small cars, and larger SUVs/trucks.\n\n==== Speed assist ====\nFront-facing cameras detect speed limit signs on HW1 vehicles and display the current limit on the dashboard or center display. Limits are compared against [[GPS]] data if no signs are present or if the vehicle is HW2 or HW2.5.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Adaptive cruise control ====\nAlso known as traffic-aware cruise control,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot|title=Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability|date=2019-02-13|website=www.tesla.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> adaptive cruise control has the ability to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of it as accelerating and braking as that vehicle speeds up and slows down. It also slows on tight curves, on interstate ramps, and when a car enters or exits the road in front of it. It can be enabled at any speed between 0&nbsp;mph and 90&nbsp;mph. By default, it sets the limit at the [[#Speed assist|current speed limit]] plus/minus a driver-specified offset, then adjusts its target speed according to changes in speed limits. If road conditions warrant, Autosteer and cruise control disengage and an audio and visual demand that the driver assume full control is displayed.\n\n==== Autosteer ====\n[[Lane centering|Autosteer]] steers the car to remain in whatever lane it is in (known as lane-keeping). With HW1 or later, it is able to safely change lanes as directed by a tap of the turn signal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Gina|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/12/16/tesla-to-limit-self-driving-functions.html|title=Tesla to limit self-driving functions|date=2015-12-16|work=Silicon Valley Business Journal|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref> HW2 was limited to {{cvt|90|mph|km/h|0}} on highway roads or to five miles over the speed limit or {{cvt|45|mph|km/h|0}} on non-divided highways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/8/15581094/tesla-autopilot-update-video-data-speed-restriction-lifted|title=Tesla wants to make self-driving cars a reality by collecting more video data from drivers|date=2015-12-16|work=The Verge|accessdate=2017-05-08}}</ref> If the driver ignores three audio warnings about controlling the steering wheel within an hour, Autopilot is disabled until the car is restarted.\n\n=== HW1, HW2, HW3 with advanced software versions ===\n\n==== Autopark ====\nAutopark parks the car in perpendicular or parallel parking spaces, with either nose or tail facing outward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/02/17/tesla-new-update-autopark-summon-v7-1-2-12-22-release-notes/|title=Tesla pushes a new update with improved \u2018Autopark\u2019 and \u2018Summon\u2019 feature [v7.1 2.12.22 release notes]|last=Lambert|first=Fred|date=2016-02-18 |website=Electrek| access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>\n\n==== Summon ====\nBasic summon is a feature enabled in 2016 which moves car into and out of a tight space using the Tesla phone app or key fob.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/summon-your-tesla-your-phone|title=Summon Your Tesla from Your Phone|date=2016-01-10|website=www.tesla.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/9/10742926/tesla-model-s-update-self-parking|title=You can now summon your Tesla from the curb|last=D'Orazio|first=Dante|date=2016-01-09|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\n=== HW2, HW3 with advanced software versions ===\n\n==== Navigate on Autopilot ====\nHW2 and later vehicles with Autosteer can execute automatic lane changes, move to a more appropriate lane based on speed, exit a freeway, and navigate freeway interchanges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-navigate-autopilot|title=Introducing Navigate on Autopilot|date=2018-10-26|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18065540/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot-model-3-test-drive|title=Tesla\u2019s Navigate on Autopilot is like Waze on steroids|last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J.|date=2018-11-06|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==== Smart Summon ====\nSmart summon is a feature enabled in 2019 and enables supervised 150-foot line-of-sight remote car retrieval using the Tesla phone app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/teslas-smart-summon-performance-doesnt-match-marketing-hype/|title=Tesla's Smart Summon Performance Doesn't Match Marketing Hype|last=Plungis|first=Jeff|website=Consumer Reports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891343/tesla-smart-summon-feature-videos-parking-accidents|title=Tesla\u2019s Smart Summon feature is already causing chaos in parking lots across America|last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J.|date=2019-09-30|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Going ALL Electric|title=Tesla Enhanced Summon {{!}} Passes another vehicle|date=2019-03-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK68bTgDn2c&list=PLsh02tWhypONL324Yxt5Xy8xqhMYgsBQ3|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Full self-driving capability====\nTesla has made claims since 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13340938/tesla-autopilot-update-model-3-elon-musk-update|title=All new Tesla cars now have hardware for \u2018full self-driving capabilities\u2019|last=Golson|first=Jordan|date=2016-10-19|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> that all new vehicles have the hardware necessary for full self driving; however this proved not to be true,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1208468535292203008?lang=en|title=Yes|last=Musk|first=Elon|date=2019-12-21|website=@elonmusk|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> since free<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-autopilot-2-5-to-3-0-hardware-retrofit-cost-results-and-more/|title=Tesla owner upgrades Autopilot 2.5 to 3.0 Hardware: Cost, results, and more|last=Alvarez|first=Simon|date=2019-11-18|website=TESLARATI|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> hardware upgrades have been required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1071846591693090816?lang=en|title=Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer.

The car may also automatically swerve out of the way to prevent a collision.\n\n==== Visualization ====\nAutopilot includes a video display of (some of) what it sees around it. It displays driving lanes and vehicles in front, behind and on either side of it (in other lanes). It also sees lane markings and speed limits (via its maps). On HW3, it displays stop signs and traffic signals.  It distinguishes pedestrians, bicyclists/motorcyclists, small cars, and larger SUVs/trucks.\n\n==== Speed assist ====\nFront-facing cameras detect speed limit signs on HW1 vehicles and display the current limit on the dashboard or center display. Limits are compared against [[GPS]] data if no signs are present or if the vehicle is HW2 or HW2.5.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Adaptive cruise control ====\nAlso known as traffic-aware cruise control,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot|title=Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability|date=2019-02-13|website=www.tesla.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> adaptive cruise control has the ability to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of it as accelerating and braking as that vehicle speeds up and slows down. It also slows on tight curves, on interstate ramps, and when a car enters or exits the road in front of it. It can be enabled at any speed between 0&nbsp;mph and 90&nbsp;mph. By default, it sets the limit at the [[#Speed assist|current speed limit]] plus/minus a driver-specified offset, then adjusts its target speed according to changes in speed limits. If road conditions warrant, Autosteer and cruise control disengage and an audio and visual demand that the driver assume full control is displayed.\n\n==== Autosteer ====\n[[Lane centering|Autosteer]] steers the car to remain in whatever lane it is in (known as lane-keeping). With HW1 or later, it is able to safely change lanes as directed by a tap of the turn signal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Gina|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/12/16/tesla-to-limit-self-driving-functions.html|title=Tesla to limit self-driving functions|date=2015-12-16|work=Silicon Valley Business Journal|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref> HW2 was limited to {{cvt|90|mph|km/h|0}} on highway roads or to five miles over the speed limit or {{cvt|45|mph|km/h|0}} on non-divided highways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/8/15581094/tesla-autopilot-update-video-data-speed-restriction-lifted|title=Tesla wants to make self-driving cars a reality by collecting more video data from drivers|date=2015-12-16|work=The Verge|accessdate=2017-05-08}}</ref> If the driver ignores three audio warnings about controlling the steering wheel within an hour, Autopilot is disabled until the car is restarted.\n\n=== HW1, HW2, HW3 with advanced software versions ===\n\n==== Autopark ====\nAutopark parks the car in perpendicular or parallel parking spaces, with either nose or tail facing outward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/02/17/tesla-new-update-autopark-summon-v7-1-2-12-22-release-notes/|title=Tesla pushes a new update with improved \u2018Autopark\u2019 and \u2018Summon\u2019 feature [v7.1 2.12.22 release notes]|last=Lambert|first=Fred|date=2016-02-18 |website=Electrek| access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>\n\n==== Summon ====\nBasic summon is a feature enabled in 2016 which moves car into and out of a tight space using the Tesla phone app or key fob.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/summon-your-tesla-your-phone|title=Summon Your Tesla from Your Phone|date=2016-01-10|website=www.tesla.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/9/10742926/tesla-model-s-update-self-parking|title=You can now summon your Tesla from the curb|last=D'Orazio|first=Dante|date=2016-01-09|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\n=== HW2, HW3 with advanced software versions ===\n\n==== Navigate on Autopilot ====\nHW2 and later vehicles with Autosteer can execute automatic lane changes, move to a more appropriate lane based on speed, exit a freeway, and navigate freeway interchanges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-navigate-autopilot|title=Introducing Navigate on Autopilot|date=2018-10-26|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18065540/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot-model-3-test-drive|title=Tesla\u2019s Navigate on Autopilot is like Waze on steroids|last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J.|date=2018-11-06|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==== Smart Summon ====\nSmart summon is a feature enabled in 2019 and enables supervised 150-foot line-of-sight remote car retrieval using the Tesla phone app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/teslas-smart-summon-performance-doesnt-match-marketing-hype/|title=Tesla's Smart Summon Performance Doesn't Match Marketing Hype|last=Plungis|first=Jeff|website=Consumer Reports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891343/tesla-smart-summon-feature-videos-parking-accidents|title=Tesla\u2019s Smart Summon feature is already causing chaos in parking lots across America|last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J.|date=2019-09-30|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Going ALL Electric|title=Tesla Enhanced Summon {{!}} Passes another vehicle|date=2019-03-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK68bTgDn2c&list=PLsh02tWhypONL324Yxt5Xy8xqhMYgsBQ3|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Full self-driving capability====\nTesla has made claims since 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13340938/tesla-autopilot-update-model-3-elon-musk-update|title=All new Tesla cars now have hardware for \u2018full self-driving capabilities\u2019|last=Golson|first=Jordan|date=2016-10-19|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> that all new vehicles have the hardware necessary for full self driving; however this proved not to be true,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1208468535292203008?lang=en|title=Yes|last=Musk|first=Elon|date=2019-12-21|website=@elonmusk|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> since free<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-autopilot-2-5-to-3-0-hardware-retrofit-cost-results-and-more/|title=Tesla owner upgrades Autopilot 2.5 to 3.0 Hardware: Cost, results, and more|last=Alvarez|first=Simon|date=2019-11-18|website=TESLARATI|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> hardware upgrades have been required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1071846591693090816?lang=en|title=Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer.
