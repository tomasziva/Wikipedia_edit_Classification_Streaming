The units were designed as successors to GE's U36B's. Of the 230 locomotives built, 180 of them were built for two Eastern railroads - [[Seaboard System Railroad]] (which became part of [[CSX Transportation]] in 1986) and [[Conrail]].\n\nThese 4-axle locomotives were powerful ones when introduced in 1980. When first built the units were rated at {{convert|3600|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}}, later versions were rated at {{convert|3750|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}}. They were designed for fast and priority service, moving [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal and container]] trains.\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe first B36-7s were built for the [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|Cotton Belt]] in January 1980. These first four units #7770-7773 were part of a thirty unit order that included 26 B30-7 units. According to ''Extra 2200 South'' magazine these units featured General Electric's new Sentry Adhesion System. The Sentry System is a wheel slip detection system. These 3600 horsepower units also featured the new GE 752AF traction motor, the new GTA-24 traction alternator and the 83:20 fine tooth gearing. \n[[File:Conrail B36-7 5054 at Cove, PA (24911988614).jpg|thumb|[[Conrail]] B36-7 5054 leads a [[Train#Freight train|Freight train]] at [[Duncannon, Pennsylvania|Duncannon, PA]]]]\n\nThe second order for B36-7s was built for the Santa Fe in October and November 1980. There was a different door configuration for the high voltage electrical cabinet when compared to the Cotton Belt order. Two units, 7484, 7486, were set up at remote control transmitters and two units were set up as remote control receivers 7485, 7487. These were the first GE units built with Locotrol remote control equipment. The units were originally tried on the York Canyon Coal trains operating between York Canyon, New Mexico and Fontana, California.\n[[File:AT&SF 7499 between the sidings of Becker and Sais, NM on the Belen Cutoff between Belen and the west end of Abo Canyon in August 1983 (28981704746).jpg|thumb|[[AT&SF]] 7499 between the sidings of Becker and Sais, NM on the Belen Cutoff between Belen and the west end of Abo Canyon in August 1983 ]]\n\n==Original owners==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Railroad\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Quantity\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Road numbers\n! bgcolor=c0c090 | Notes\n|-\n|[[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]]\n|16\n|7484-7499\n|Some of the units were sold to British Columbia Railway, Renumbered 3604-3613.\n|-\n|[[Conrail]]\n|60\n|5000-5059\n|5045 destroyed in the [[1987 Maryland train collision]].\n|-\n|[[Cerrejon Coal Project]] ([[Colombia]])\n|8\n|1001\u20131008\n|\n|-\n|[[Seaboard System]]\n|120\n|5806-5925\n|To CSX; All retired as of Dec 2009.\n|-\n|[[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]]\n|6\n|3815-3820\n|High hood.\n|-\n|[[Southern Pacific Transportation Company]]\n|16\n|7754-7769\n|\n|-\n|[[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|Cotton Belt]]\n|4\n|7770-7773\n|\n|-\n|}\n==See also==\n* [[GE U36B]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{Marre, Pinkepank - Diesel spotters guide - 2nd}}\nExtra 2200 South Issue #69 dated February 1980 pages 7 and 17.\n\nExtra 2200 South Issue #72 dated January 1981 pages 7 and 17. \n{{commons category|GE B36-7 locomotives}}\n{{GE diesels}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ge B36-7}}\n[[Category:General Electric locomotives|B36-7]]\n[[Category:B-B locomotives]]\n[[Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Freight locomotives]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Colombia]]\n[[Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Colombia]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox locomotive\n|  name=GE B36-7\n|  powertype=[[Diesel-electric]]\n|  image=CSXT 5842 GE B36-7.jpg\n|  caption=[[CSX Transportation|CSXT]] 5842, a GE B36-7\n|  gauge={{Track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}\n|  builder=[[GE Transportation Systems]]\n|  buildmodel=B36-7\n|  builddate=1980 &ndash; 1985\n|  totalproduction=230\n|  locale=[[North America]] [[South America]]\n|  primemover=[[GE 7FDL]]16\n|  poweroutput= {{convert|3600|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}}early {{convert|3750|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}}late \n|  aspiration=[[Turbocharger|Turbocharged]]\n|  disposition=Most scrapped.
