showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all y axes in order to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=1\n|showSymbols=1\n|width=800\n|height=400<!--height = 80 X <no. of log10 cycles in y

showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all y axes in order to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=1\n|showSymbols=1\n|width=800\n|height=400<!--height = 80 X <no. of log10 cycles in y
