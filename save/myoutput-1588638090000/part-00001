Between 2008 and 2013, it was within the [[Tablelands Region]]. The town's name is derived from an [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word meaning ''meeting of the waters''.<ref>queenslandplaces.com.au/mareeba</ref>\n\n==History==\nPrior to European settlement, the area around Mareeba was inhabited by the [[Muluridji people]]. They maintained a hunter/gatherer existence in the area between [[Mount Carbine, Queensland|Mount Carbine]], Mareeba, Rumula (near [[Julatten, Queensland|Julatten]]) and Woodville (near [[Canoona]]), mainly concentrated between [[Biboohra, Queensland|Biboohra]] and [[Mount Molloy, Queensland|Mount Molloy]]. In the local Aboriginal language, Mareeba means meeting of the waters - referring to the point at which the Barron River is joined by Granite Creek.The town is full of stoners like Jake wOODS\n\nOn 26 May 1875 [[James Venture Mulligan]] became the first European officially to see the future site of Mareeba when he rode up the eastern bank of the Barron River, and passed the junctions of Emerald Creek and Granite Creek.\n\nThe Mareeba area was first settled by Europeans in 1877 by [[John Atherton (pioneer)|John Atherton]], who arrived with cattle at Emerald End, which is just north of the town today. Mareeba quickly became a busy coach stop for [[Cobb & Co]] on the road from [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]] to [[Herberton, Queensland|Herberton]]. When the [[railway]] arrived in 1893, Mareeba grew into a busy town.\n\nMareeba Post Office opened on 25 August 1893 (a [[receiving office]] named Granite Creek had been open from 1891).

Between 2008 and 2013, it was within the [[Tablelands Region]]. The town's name is derived from an [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word meaning ''meeting of the waters''.<ref>queenslandplaces.com.au/mareeba</ref>\n\n==History==\nPrior to European settlement, the area around Mareeba was inhabited by the [[Muluridji people]]. They maintained a hunter/gatherer existence in the area between [[Mount Carbine, Queensland|Mount Carbine]], Mareeba, Rumula (near [[Julatten, Queensland|Julatten]]) and Woodville (near [[Canoona]]), mainly concentrated between [[Biboohra, Queensland|Biboohra]] and [[Mount Molloy, Queensland|Mount Molloy]]. In the local Aboriginal language, Mareeba means meeting of the waters - referring to the point at which the Barron River is joined by Granite Creek.\n\nOn 26 May 1875 [[James Venture Mulligan]] became the first European officially to see the future site of Mareeba when he rode up the eastern bank of the Barron River, and passed the junctions of Emerald Creek and Granite Creek.\n\nThe Mareeba area was first settled by Europeans in 1877 by [[John Atherton (pioneer)|John Atherton]], who arrived with cattle at Emerald End, which is just north of the town today. Mareeba quickly became a busy coach stop for [[Cobb & Co]] on the road from [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]] to [[Herberton, Queensland|Herberton]]. When the [[railway]] arrived in 1893, Mareeba grew into a busy town.\n\nMareeba Post Office opened on 25 August 1893 (a [[receiving office]] named Granite Creek had been open from 1891). A Mareeba Diggings Post Office opened by 1893 and closed in 1905.<ref name=\"Post Office\">{{Cite web  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List  | publisher = Premier Postal Auctions  | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=QLD&country=  | accessdate = 10 May 2014  | url-status = live  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140515223132/http://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=QLD&country=  | archivedate = 15 May 2014  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, up to 10,000 Australian and US service personnel used [[Mareeba Airfield]] as a staging post for battles in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Pacific]].
