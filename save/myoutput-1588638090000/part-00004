Gamera first appeared in [[Noriaki Yuasa]]'s 1965 film ''[[Gamera, the Giant Monster]]'', produced by [[Daiei Film]]. The character and the first film were intended to compete with the success of [[Toho]]'s [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' film series]]. Since then, Gamera has become a Japanese icon in his own right, appearing in a total of 12 films produced by [[Daiei Film]] and later [[Kadokawa Daiei Studio]], as well as in [[comic books]], [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. Gamera has been given various nicknames throughout the history of the franchise, including '''the Friend of All Children''' and '''the Guardian of the Universe'''.\n\nGamera is depicted a massive, fire-breathing, prehistoric monster resembling a [[turtle]], mutated by exposure to [[nuclear weapon]]s. In the first film, Gamera is portrayed as aggressive and destructive, though he also saves the life of a young Japanese boy. As the film series progressed, Gamera took on a more benevolent role, becoming a protecter of humanity, and especially of human children, from [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial races]] and other giant monsters.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=178}}\n\nIn the United States, Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of [[UHF television]] stations featuring Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e showcases like ''[[Creature Double Feature]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Corey|first=Joe|url=https://insidepulse.com/2012/08/31/dvd-review-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-season-1-vol-1/|title=DVD Review: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (Season 1, Vol. 1)|date=31 August 2012|website=InsidePulse|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> and later in the 1990s when five ''Gamera'' films were featured on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n\n==Overview==\n===Conception===\n[[File:Ddol-mangM.jpg|thumb|The [[Black Tortoise]], one of the [[Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellations]], is a possible source of inspiration for Gamera.<ref name=kotz />]]\nThe idea for Gamera was developed by Yonejiro Saito.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=177}} The character was created as a property of the production company [[Daiei Film]], and was intended to compete with the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' film series]] (featuring [[Godzilla|the giant monster character of the same name]]), owned by rival studio [[Toho]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Clarke|first=Frederick S.|date=1996|title=Cinefantastique| volume=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyEnAQAAIAAJ|magazine=Cinefantastique|page=3|location=Google Books|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/287002/heres-why-we-probably-wont-see-gamera-in-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters/|title=Here's Why We Probably Won't See Gamera in GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS|date=22 December 2018|website=Dread Central|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Nicholas|url=https://screenrant.com/godzilla-king-monsters-atlantis-new-titans/|title=Godzilla: King Of The Monsters' Atlantis Sets Up Multiple New Titans|date=21 June 2019|website=ScreenRant|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> Gamera has been described as being a [[rip-off]] of Godzilla.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=178}}<ref name=deusner>{{cite web|last=Deusner|first=Stephen M.|author-link=Stephen Deusner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/05/17/gamera-the-giant-monster-dvd-review/|title=Turtle Soup: 'Gamera, the Giant Monster'|date=17 May 2010|work=The Washington Post|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Orr|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Orr (film critic)|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/05/why-you-should-watch-the-actual-original-godzilla/371389/|title=Why You Should Watch the (Actual) Original Godzilla|date=22 May 2014|work=The Atlantic|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe name {{nihongo|''Gamera''|\u30ac\u30e1\u30e9}} derives from the Japanese ''kame'' (\"turtle\"), and the suffix ''-ra'', a suffix shared by such other ''kaiju'' characters as [[Godzilla]] (''Gojira'') and [[Mothra]].{{sfn|Di Giorgio|Gigante|Gordiano|2012|p=64}} Gamera's name was spelled ''Gammera'' in the title of ''Gammera the Invincible'', the re-titled American release of the first film in the franchise, ''Gamera, the Giant Monster''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gammera_the_invincible_1966|title=Gammera The Invincible (1966)|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=8 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=dvdtalk>{{cite web|last=Galbraith IV|first=Stuart|author-link=Stuart Galbraith IV|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/42231/gamera-the-giant-monster/|title=Gamera - The Giant Monster|date=18 May 2010|website=DVD Talk|access-date=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nGamera's turtle-like design may have been inspired by the [[Black Tortoise]], one of the [[Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellations]] in [[East Asian mythology]].<ref name=kotz>{{cite web|last=Kotz|first=Sean|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/03/19/why-the-heck-is-gamera-a-turtle/|title=Why the Heck is Gamera a Turtle?|date=19 March 2006|website=SciFi Japan|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> The Black Tortoise is known as ''Genbu'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a [[Snake in Chinese mythology|snake]].<ref name=kotz /> Each of the Four Symbols are said to act as guardians over each of the four [[cardinal direction]]s, with the dragon ''[[Azure Dragon|Seiryu]]'' in the [[east]];

A total of seven ''Gamera'' films were produced between 1965 and 1971, with one being released each year. These films, several of which were also directed by Yuasa, became popular with child audiences. During this time, five of the seven films were picked up for television distribution in the United States by [[American International Television]].

The character and the first film were intended to compete with the success of [[Toho]]'s [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' film series]]. Since then, Gamera has become a Japanese icon in his own right, appearing in a total of 12 films produced by [[Daiei Film]] and later [[Kadokawa Daiei Studio]], as well as in [[comic books]], [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. Gamera has been given various nicknames throughout the history of the franchise, including '''the Friend of All Children''' and '''the Guardian of the Universe'''.\n\nGamera is depicted a massive, fire-breathing, prehistoric monster resembling a [[turtle]], mutated by exposure to [[nuclear weapon]]s. In the first film, Gamera is portrayed as aggressive and destructive, though he also saves the life of a young Japanese boy. As the film series progressed, Gamera took on a more benevolent role, becoming a protecter of humanity, and especially of human children, from [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial races]] and other giant monsters.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=178}}\n\nIn the United States, Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of [[UHF television]] stations featuring Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e showcases like ''[[Creature Double Feature]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Corey|first=Joe|url=https://insidepulse.com/2012/08/31/dvd-review-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-season-1-vol-1/|title=DVD Review: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (Season 1, Vol. 1)|date=31 August 2012|website=InsidePulse|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> and later in the 1990s when five ''Gamera'' films were featured on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.\n\n==Overview==\n===Conception===\n[[File:Ddol-mangM.jpg|thumb|The [[Black Tortoise]], one of the [[Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellations]], is a possible source of inspiration for Gamera.<ref name=kotz />]]\nThe idea for Gamera was developed by Yonejiro Saito.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=177}} The character was created as a property of the production company [[Daiei Film]], and was intended to compete with the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' film series]] (featuring [[Godzilla|the giant monster character of the same name]]), owned by rival studio [[Toho]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Clarke|first=Frederick S.|date=1996|title=Cinefantastique| volume=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyEnAQAAIAAJ|magazine=Cinefantastique|page=3|location=Google Books|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/287002/heres-why-we-probably-wont-see-gamera-in-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters/|title=Here's Why We Probably Won't See Gamera in GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS|date=22 December 2018|website=Dread Central|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Nicholas|url=https://screenrant.com/godzilla-king-monsters-atlantis-new-titans/|title=Godzilla: King Of The Monsters' Atlantis Sets Up Multiple New Titans|date=21 June 2019|website=ScreenRant|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> Gamera has been described as being a [[rip-off]] of Godzilla.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=178}}<ref name=deusner>{{cite web|last=Deusner|first=Stephen M.|author-link=Stephen Deusner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/05/17/gamera-the-giant-monster-dvd-review/|title=Turtle Soup: 'Gamera, the Giant Monster'|date=17 May 2010|work=The Washington Post|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Orr|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Orr (film critic)|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/05/why-you-should-watch-the-actual-original-godzilla/371389/|title=Why You Should Watch the (Actual) Original Godzilla|date=22 May 2014|work=The Atlantic|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe name {{nihongo|''Gamera''|\u30ac\u30e1\u30e9}} derives from the Japanese ''kame'' (\"turtle\"), and the suffix ''-ra'', a suffix shared by such other ''kaiju'' characters as [[Godzilla]] (''Gojira'') and [[Mothra]].{{sfn|Di Giorgio|Gigante|Gordiano|2012|p=64}} Gamera's name was spelled ''Gammera'' in the title of ''Gammera the Invincible'', the re-titled American release of the first film in the franchise, ''Gamera, the Giant Monster''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gammera_the_invincible_1966|title=Gammera The Invincible (1966)|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=8 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=dvdtalk>{{cite web|last=Galbraith IV|first=Stuart|author-link=Stuart Galbraith IV|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/42231/gamera-the-giant-monster/|title=Gamera - The Giant Monster|date=18 May 2010|website=DVD Talk|access-date=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nGamera's turtle-like design may have been inspired by the [[Black Tortoise]], one of the [[Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellations]] in [[East Asian mythology]].<ref name=kotz>{{cite web|last=Kotz|first=Sean|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/03/19/why-the-heck-is-gamera-a-turtle/|title=Why the Heck is Gamera a Turtle?|date=19 March 2006|website=SciFi Japan|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> The Black Tortoise is known as ''Genbu'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a [[Snake in Chinese mythology|snake]].<ref name=kotz /> Each of the Four Symbols are said to act as guardians over each of the four [[cardinal direction]]s, with the dragon ''[[Azure Dragon|Seiryu]]'' in the [[east]];

A total of seven ''Gamera'' films were produced between 1965 and 1971, with one being released each year.

During this time, five of the seven films were picked up for television distribution in the United States by [[American International Television]].
