The railroad bypassed us, and the town was dying.\"<ref name=\"time1\"/> Pegues further claimed that Judge Proctor never operated a windmill on his property, a statement later refuted as part of the ''[[UFO Hunters]]'' episode, which found the base of a wooden water pump tower constructed around the well.\n\n==Investigations==\n[[File:Aurora Texas UFO Incident 1.jpg|thumb|right|A newspaper clipping on the incident.]]\n\nThe incident has been investigated on numerous occasions. One report was broadcast by local television station [[KDFW|KDFW FOX 4]] and two other reports aired on cable television.\n\n===KDFW report===\nIn 1998 Dallas-based TV station [[KDFW]] aired a lengthy report about the Aurora incident. Reporter Richard Ray interviewed former ''[[Fort Worth Star Telegram]]'' reporter Jim Marrs and other locals, who said something crashed in Aurora. However, Ray's report was unable to find conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology. Ray reported that the State of Texas erected a historical plaque in town that outlines the tale and labels it \"legend.\"\n\n===''UFO Files'' investigation===\nOn December 19, 2005, ''[[UFO Files]]'' first aired an episode related to this incident, titled \"Texas' Roswell\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The episode featured a 1973 investigation led by Bill Case, an aviation writer for the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]''{{efn|The MUFON case file lists Case as a writer for the ''Herald''; however, the episode erroneously mentions him as a ''Morning News'' writer.}} and the Texas state director of [[Mutual UFO Network]] (MUFON).\n\nMUFON uncovered two new eyewitnesses to the crash. Mary Evans, who was 15 at the time, told of how her parents went to the crash site (they forbade her from going) and the discovery of the alien body. Charlie Stephens, who was age 10, told how he saw the airship trailing smoke as it headed north toward Aurora. He wanted to see what happened, but his father made him finish his chores; later, he told how his father went to town the next day and saw wreckage from the crash.\n\nMUFON then investigated the Aurora Cemetery and uncovered a grave marker that appeared to show a flying saucer of some sort, as well as readings from its metal detector. MUFON asked for permission to exhume the site, but the cemetery association declined permission. After the MUFON investigation, the marker mysteriously disappeared from the cemetery and a three-inch pipe was placed into the ground; MUFON's metal detector no longer picked up metal readings from the grave, thus it was presumed that the metal was removed from the grave.\n\nMUFON's report eventually stated that the evidence was inconclusive, but did not rule out the possibility of a hoax. The episode featured an interview with Mayor Brammer who discussed the town's tragic history.\n\n===''UFO Hunters'' investigation===\nOn November 19, 2008, ''[[UFO Hunters]]'' first aired another television documentary regarding the Aurora incident, titled \"First Contact\".\n\nThe documentary featured one notable change from the ''UFO Files'' story \u2013 Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates and the now-owner of the property with the sealed well where the UFO wreckage was purportedly buried, allowed the investigators to unseal the well, in order to examine it for possible debris. Water was taken from the well which tested normal except for large amounts of aluminum present; the well had no significant contents. It was stated in the episode that any large pieces of metal had been removed from the well by a past owner of the property. Further, the remains of a windmill base were found near the well site, which refuted Ms. Pegues' statements (from the 1979 ''Time'' magazine article) that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property.\n\nIn addition, the Aurora Cemetery was again examined. Although the cemetery association still did not permit exhumation, using [[ground-penetrating radar]] and photos from prior visits, an unmarked grave was found in the area near other 1890s graves.<ref name=Gravesite>{{cite web |url=http://ufo.whipnet.org/xdocs/aurora.texas/ |website=UFO.WHIPNET.ORG|title=The Aurora Encounter.
