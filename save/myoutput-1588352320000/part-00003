This pattern was reflected in English common law, which was the first in Europe to establish statutory rape laws and ages of consent for marriage. In 1275 sexual relations with girls under either 12 or 14 (depending on interpretation of the sources) were criminalized; the age was reduced to 10 in 1576. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British colonial administration introduced marriage age restrictions for Hindu and Muslim girls on the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=Brown3140/>\n\nA Scottish physician living in 18th century Syria reported that locals tried to contract marriages for their children at a young age, but the marriage was not consummated until the girl \"had come of age\". Evidence from 19th century Palestine suggests that husbands sometimes initiated sexual relations before their wife reached puberty, but that it was a rare occurrence, condemned socially and censured by [[sharia]] courts. Writing in 1830s, [[Edward William Lane]] observed that few Egyptian girls remained single by the age of 16, but socio-economic transformation, educational reforms and influence of Western norms brought significant changes, and by 1920 fewer than 10% of Egyptian women married before the age of 20.

This requires parents to bestow property on the marriage of a daughter, which is often an economic challenge for many families. The difficulty to save and preserve wealth for dowry was common, particularly in times of economic hardship, or persecution, or unpredictable seizure of property and savings. These difficulties pressed families to betroth their girls, irrespective of her age, as soon as they had the resources to pay the dowry. Thus, Goitein notes that European Jews would marry their girls early, once they had collected the expected amount of dowry.<ref name=goitein78>S.D.

Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century,  most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 13-16 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 for boys and 16 for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age.<ref name=EI2-8-29>{{Cite encyclopedia|author1=Schacht, J.|author2= Layish, A.|author3= Shaham, R.|author4= Ansari, Ghaus|author5= Otto, J.M.|author6= Pompe, S.|author7= Knappert, J. |author8=Boyd, Jean| year=1995 | title=Nik\u0101\u1e25|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editor1=P.

After the two-year program, girls in families eligible for the program were three times more likely to be in school and one tenth as likely to be married compared to their peers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn the other free program the [[Global Campaign for the Prevention of Child Marriage (GCPCM)]] has been launched in March 2019, and the primary goal of this Campaign is raising awareness and illuminating people's minds to address child marriage in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpnn-world.org/new/?p=15882 |title=The Global Campaign for the Prevention of Child Marriage |website=cpnn-world.org |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wntv.uk/the-global-campaign-for-the-prevention-of-child-marriage/ |title=The Global campaign for the prevention of child marriage |publisher=World News TV, UK |date=24 May 2019 |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> \n \nOther programs have addressed child marriage less directly through a variety of programming related to girls' empowerment, education, sexual and reproductive health, financial literacy, life skills, communication skills, and community mobilization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrw.org/publications/more-power-to-her-how-empowering-girls-can-end-child-marriage/|title=More power to her: how empowering girls can end child marriage|website=ICRW {{!}} PASSION.

This \"tipping point\", or age at which rates of marriage increase dramatically, may occur years before the median age of marriage. Therefore, the researchers argue prevention programs should focus their programming on girls who are pre-tipping point age rather than only girls who are married before they reach the median age for marriage.<ref>Jain, Saranga, and Kathleen Kurz. 2007.

This pattern was reflected in English common law, which was the first in Europe to establish statutory rape laws and ages of consent for marriage. In 1275 sexual relations with girls under either 12 or 14 (depending on interpretation of the sources) were criminalized; the age was reduced to 10 in 1576.

Writing in 1830s, [[Edward William Lane]] observed that few Egyptian girls remained single by the age of 16, but socio-economic transformation, educational reforms and influence of Western norms brought significant changes, and by 1920 fewer than 10% of Egyptian women married before the age of 20.

This requires parents to bestow property on the marriage of a daughter, which is often an economic challenge for many families. The difficulty to save and preserve wealth for dowry was common, particularly in times of economic hardship, or persecution, or unpredictable seizure of property and savings. These difficulties pressed families to betroth their girls, irrespective of her age, as soon as they had the resources to pay the dowry. Thus, Goitein notes that European Jews would marry their girls early, once they had collected the expected amount of dowry.<ref name=goitein78>S.D.

Such fears and social pressures have been proposed as causes that lead to child marriages. Insofar as child marriage is a social norm in practicing communities, the elimination of child marriage must come through a changing of those social norms.

However, there is a correlation between restrictions placed by laws and the average age of first marriage. In the United States, per [[1960 United States Census|1960 Census]] data, 3.5% of girls married before the age of 16, while an additional 11.9% married between 16 and 18. States with lower marriage age limits saw higher percentages of child marriages.<ref name=ncbi/> This correlation between higher age of marriage in civil law and observed frequency of child marriages breaks down in countries with Islam as the state religion. In Islamic nations, many countries do not allow child marriage of girls under their civil code of laws. But, the state recognized Sharia religious laws and courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code, and often do.

Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century,  most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 13-16 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 for boys and 16 for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age.<ref name=EI2-8-29>{{Cite encyclopedia|author1=Schacht, J.|author2= Layish, A.|author3= Shaham, R.|author4= Ansari, Ghaus|author5= Otto, J.M.|author6= Pompe, S.|author7= Knappert, J. |author8=Boyd, Jean| year=1995 | title=Nik\u0101\u1e25|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editor1=P.

After the two-year program, girls in families eligible for the program were three times more likely to be in school and one tenth as likely to be married compared to their peers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn the other free program the [[Global Campaign for the Prevention of Child Marriage (GCPCM)]] has been launched in March 2019, and the primary goal of this Campaign is raising awareness and illuminating people's minds to address child marriage in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpnn-world.org/new/?p=15882 |title=The Global Campaign for the Prevention of Child Marriage |website=cpnn-world.org |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wntv.uk/the-global-campaign-for-the-prevention-of-child-marriage/ |title=The Global campaign for the prevention of child marriage |publisher=World News TV, UK |date=24 May 2019 |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> \n \nOther programs have addressed child marriage less directly through a variety of programming related to girls' empowerment, education, sexual and reproductive health, financial literacy, life skills, communication skills, and community mobilization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrw.org/publications/more-power-to-her-how-empowering-girls-can-end-child-marriage/|title=More power to her: how empowering girls can end child marriage|website=ICRW {{!}} PASSION.

This \"tipping point\", or age at which rates of marriage increase dramatically, may occur years before the median age of marriage. Therefore, the researchers argue prevention programs should focus their programming on girls who are pre-tipping point age rather than only girls who are married before they reach the median age for marriage.<ref>Jain, Saranga, and Kathleen Kurz. 2007.
