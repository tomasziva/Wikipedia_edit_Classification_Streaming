After relocating from England to San Francisco, Gunn wrote about gay-related topics\u2014particularly in his most famous work, ''The Man With Night Sweats'' in 1992\u2014as well as drug use, sex and his bohemian lifestyle.

Both of his parents were journalists.  They divorced when he was 10 years old. When he was a teenager his mother killed herself. It was she who had sparked in him a love of reading, including an interest in the work of [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[John Keats]], [[John Milton]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], along with several prose writers. In his youth, he attended [[University College School]] in Hampstead, London, then spent two years in the British national service and six months in Paris. Later, he studied English literature at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1953 having achieved a first in Part I of the Tripos and a second in Part II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Literary History of Cambridge (Revised Edition)|last=Chainey|first=Graham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=0521482445|location=Cambridge|pages=271\u20132}}</ref> ''Fighting Terms'', his first collection of verse, was published in the following year.

He enjoyed the bohemian lifestyle in San Francisco so much that [[Edmund White]] described him as \"the last of the commune dwellers [...] serious and intellectual by day and druggy and sexual by night\". While he continued to sharpen his use of the metrical forms that characterised his early career, he became more and more interested in [[syllabic verse|syllabics]] and [[free verse]]. \"He's possibly the only poet to have written a halfway decent [[quintain (poetry)|quintain]] while on [[LSD]], and he's certainly one of the few to profess genuine admiration for both [Yvor] [[Yvor Winters|Winters]] (the archformalist) and Allen Ginsberg (the arch ... well, [[Allen Ginsberg]])\", critic Daniel Orr has written. \"This is, even for the poetry world, a pretty odd background.\"<ref name=donyt>Orr, Daniel, \"On Poetry\" column, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/books/review/Orr-t.html?_r=1&ref=books&pagewanted=print \"Too Close to Touch\"], ''New York Times Book Review'', 12 July 2009 (published 9 July online), retrieved 12 July 2009</ref>\n\nIn classic verse forms, like the [[terza rima]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], he explored modern anxieties:\n\n{{poemquote|It is despair that nothing cannot be\nFlares in the mind and leaves a smoky mark\nOf dread.\n       Look upward. Neither firm nor free\nPurposeless matter hovers in the dark.|\"The Annihilation of Nothing\"}}\n\nGunn, who praised his [[Stanford]] mentor [[Yvor Winters]] for keeping \"both Rule and Energy in view, / Much power in each, most in the balanced two,\" found a productive tension \u2013 rather than imaginative restriction \u2013 in the technical demands of traditional poetic forms. He is one of the few contemporary poets ([[James Merrill]] would be another) to write serious poetry in [[heroic couplets]] \u2013 a form whose use in the twentieth century is generally restricted to [[light verse]] and epigrammatic wit. In the 1960s, however, he came to experiment increasingly with free verse, and the discipline of writing to a specific set of visual images, coupled with the liberation of free verse, constituted a new source of rule and energy in Gunn's work: a poem such as \"Pierce Street\" in his next collection, ''Touch'' (1967), has a grainy, photographic fidelity, while the title-poem uses hesitant, sinuous free verse to portray a scene of newly acknowledged intimacy shared with his sleeping lover (and the cat).\n\nThe poet's major stylistic change in his shift toward free verse roughly within a decade that included much of the 1960s, combined with the other changes in his life &mdash; his move from England to America, from academic Cambridge to bohemian San Francisco, his becoming openly gay, his drug-taking, his writing about the \"urban underbelly\" &mdash; caused many to conjecture how his lifestyle was affecting his work. \"British reviewers who opposed Gunn's technical shifts blamed California, just as American critics would, later on, connect his adventurous lifestyle with his more 'relaxed' versification,\" according to Orr, who added that even as of 2009, critics were contrasting \"Gunn's libido with his tight metrics &mdash; as if no one had ever written quatrains about having sex before\".<ref name=donyt/>\n\nIn Gunn's next book, ''Jack Straw's Castle'' (1976), the dream modulates into nightmare, related partly to his actual anxiety-dreams about moving house, and partly to the changing American political climate. \"But my life,\" he wrote, \"insists on continuities &mdash; between America and England, between free verse and metre, between vision and everyday consciousness.\"\n\n''The Passages of Joy'' reaffirmed those continuities: it contains sequences about London in 1964\u201365 and about time spent in New York in 1970. ''The Occasions of Poetry'', a selection of his essays and introductions, appeared at the same time.\n\nTen years were to pass before his next and most famous collection, ''The Man With Night Sweats'' (1992), dominated by AIDS-related elegies.<ref name=donyt/> [[Neil Powell (author)|Neil Powell]] praised the book: \"Gunn restores poetry to a centrality it has often seemed close to losing, by dealing in the context of a specific human catastrophe with the great themes of life and death, coherently, intelligently, memorably. One could hardly ask for more.\" As a result of the book, Gunn received the [[Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize]] in 1993.<ref name=poetsorg/> Although AIDS was a focus of much of his later work, he remained HIV-negative himself.<ref name=sfgate>Biespiel, David, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/04/26/DDGQMCDQ941.DTL \"A Poet's Life Part Two\"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 26 April 2005, retrieved 17 July 2009</ref>\n\nThat year, Gunn published a second collection of essays with an interview, ''Shelf Life'', and his substantial'' Collected Poems'', which [[David Biespiel]] hailed as a highlight of the century's poetry: \"Thom Gunn is a poet of 'comradely love.' Compassion has always been his domain and his work's principal emotion. If 20th century verse written in English can be seen as a battle between memory and voice - between the phenomena and its history, on the one hand, and the poet's conviction and feeling about it, on the other - then Gunn's importance lies in the accuracy with which he unifies the language and emotion of experience.
