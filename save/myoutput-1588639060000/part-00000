The top or label layer is affected before the bottom layer. The disc becomes progressively darker over time; tracks at the end of the disc (near the outer edge) show an increasing number of disc-read errors before becoming unplayable.\n\nCD bronzing seems to occur mostly with audio CDs manufactured by Philips and Dupont Optical (PDO) at its plant in [[Blackburn|Blackburn, Lancashire, UK]], between the years 1988 and 1993. Most, but not all, of these discs have \"Made in U.K. by PDO\" etched into them (see image). Discs manufactured by PDO in other countries do not seem to be affected. A similar, if considerably less widespread problem occurred with discs manufactured by Optical Media Storage (Opti.Me.S) in Italy.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.\n\nPDO acknowledged that the problem was due to a manufacturing error on its part, but it gave different explanations for the problem. The most widely acknowledged explanation{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} is that the lacquer used to coat the discs was not resistant to the [[sulfur]] content of the paper in the booklets, which led to the corrosion of the aluminium layer of the disc, even though PDO later said it was because \"a silver coating had been used on its discs instead of the standard gold.\"<ref name=\"Bishop\">{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3940669.stm\n|title=Is music safe on compact disc?\n|last=Bishop\n|first=Tom\n|work=[[BBC]]\n|date=27 August 2004\n|accessdate=2007-08-02\n}}</ref> [[Peter Copeland]] of the [[British Library Sound Archive]] confirmed that silver instead of aluminium in the reflective layer of the CD would react with sulfur compounds in the sleeves, forming [[silver sulfate]]{{dubious|date=October 2010}}, which has a bronze colour.<ref name=\"IASA\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.iasa-web.org/content/information-bulletin-no-22-july-1997\n|title=Bronzed CD alert!\n|work=IASA Information Bulletin no. 22\n|date=July 1997\n|accessdate=2007-08-03\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722224026/http://www.iasa-web.org/content/information-bulletin-no-22-july-1997\n|archive-date=22 July 2011\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> A combination of the two factors seems likely because, as Barbara Hirsch of the University of California points out, the oxidation could only have occurred if the protective lacquer did not seal the metal film and substrate well enough.<ref name=\"Hirsch\"/>\n\nThere are also isolated reports of CD discolouring with discs from other pressing plants, but these do not seem to be as widespread and may be due to other reasons than the manufacturing error that occurred at PDO.

A minimum measure would be to remove the booklet and paper inlay from the CD's jewel case, though it might be advisable to store affected CDs in envelopes made of alkaline paper inside a box made of acid-free cardboard. Plastic or [[polyvinyl|vinyl]] sleeves are not considered safe because the [[Plasticizer|softening agents]] in the plastic may lead to further corrosion; [[polypropylene]] sleeves are a notable safe exception.
