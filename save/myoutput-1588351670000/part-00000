The recent drought in many African countries, which has been linked to climate change, adversely affected both energy security and economic growth across the continent.\n\n=== Agriculture and food security ===\nAgriculture is inherently sensitive to climate conditions and is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=L\u00e4derach|first=Peter|last2=Martinez-Valle|first2=Armando|last3=Bourgoin|first3=Clement|last4=Parker|first4=Louis|date=2019-03-27|title=Vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change: The development of a pan-tropical Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment to inform sub-national decision making|journal=PLOS One|volume=14|issue=3|pages=e0213641|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0213641|issn=1932-6203|pmc=6436735|pmid=30917146|bibcode=2019PLoSO..1413641P}}</ref> Agriculture in most\u00a0 African countries is mainly small-scale and rain-fed, making it particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change.

African countries need to build a national legal framework to manage food resources in accordance with the anticipated climate variability. However, before devising a policy to cope with the impacts of climate variability, especially to the agriculture sector, it is critical to have a clear understanding of how climate variability affects different food crops.\n\nIn the year 2020, sever invasion of [[Locust]]s harmed the agriculture in eastern Africa.

To improve understanding of past and future changes in water availability due to climate change, the IPCC (IPCC 2013) recommends using the dynamic downscaling technique. The IPCC 2013 proposed using the coordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX) regional climate models which runs at a maximum of 50&nbsp; km resolutions, the resolution used depends upon the size of the watershed and area coverage by the meteorological records. However, before using the climate simulations from the dynamic downscaling, it is appropriate to evaluate their performance at different spatial scales since their performance differs from one location to another and from one RCM to another.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{main|Effects of global warming on human health}}\nAfrican countries have the least efficient public health systems in the world.<ref name=\":12\">World Health Organization.

For instance, over 90 percent of annual global malaria cases are in Africa.<ref name=\":12\" /> Changes in climate will affect the spread of infectious agents as well as alter people\u2019s disposition to these infections.\n\n=== Energy ===\nWith increasing population and corresponding energy demand, energy security must be addressed because energy is crucial for sustainable development. Climate change has affected energy sectors in Africa as many countries depend on hydropower generation. Decreasing rainfall levels and droughts have resulted in lower water levels in dams with adverse impacts on hydropower generation. This has resulted in low electrical energy production, high cost of electricity and power outages or load-shedding in some African countries that depend on hydroelectric power generation. Disruptions in hydropower generation have negatively affected various sectors in countries such as Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania.\n\n=== Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ===\n\n== African Highlands ==\n\n=== Shifts in Malaria Transmission Due to Climate Change ===\nClimate change, and resulting in increased temperatures, storms, droughts, and rising sea levels, will affect the incidence and distribution of infectious disease across the globe.<ref name=\":0\">Beard, C.

An increase in the number of vectors that carry parasites, microbes, and pathogens that cause disease will become a health hazard for the human population.<ref name=\":0\" /> Specifically, malaria is caused by the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' and ''Plasmodium vivax'' parasites which are carried by the vector ''Anopheles'' mosquito.

If deforestation continues at its current rate, more land will be available for mosquito breeding grounds, and the population of mosquitos will rapidly increase. The increase in mosquitoes will thus increase the opportunity for both ''Plasmodium falciparum'' and ''Plasmodium vivax'' parasites to proliferate.\n\nExposure to malaria will become a greater risk to humans as the number of female ''Anopheles'' mosquitos infected with either the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' or ''Plasmodium vivax'' parasite increases.<ref name=\":3\" /> The mosquito will transmit the parasite to the human host through a bite, resulting in infection. Then, when an uninfected mosquito bites the now infected human host, the parasite will be transmitted to the mosquitoes which will then become an exposure to other uninfected human hosts. Individuals who are constantly exposed to the Malaria parasite due to multiple bites by mosquitoes that carry the parasite are at greater risk of dying.<ref name=\":2\" /> Infected humans can also transmit the disease to uninfected or healthy humans via contaminated blood.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== ''Health Effects'' ====\nThe health effects caused by shifts in malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands have the potential to be severe. Research has shown that the effects of climate change on health will impact most populations over the next few decades.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costello |first1=Anthony |last2=Abbas |first2=Mustafa |last3=Allen |first3=Adriana |last4=Ball |first4=Sarah |last5=Bell |first5=Sarah |last6=Bellamy |first6=Richard |last7=Friel |first7=Sharon |last8=Groce |first8=Nora |last9=Johnson |first9=Anne |last10=Kett |first10=Maria |last11=Lee |first11=Maria |last12=Levy |first12=Caren |last13=Maslin |first13=Mark |last14=McCoy |first14=David |last15=McGuire |first15=Bill |last16=Montgomery |first16=Hugh |last17=Napier |first17=David |last18=Pagel |first18=Christina |last19=Patel |first19=Jinesh |last20=de Oliveira |first20=Jose Antonio Puppim |last21=Redclift |first21=Nanneke |last22=Rees |first22=Hannah |last23=Rogger |first23=Daniel |last24=Scott |first24=Joanne |last25=Stephenson |first25=Judith |last26=Twigg |first26=John |last27=Wolff |first27=Jonathan |last28=Patterson |first28=Craig |title=Managing the health effects of climate change |journal=The Lancet |date=May 2009 |volume=373 |issue=9676 |pages=1693\u20131733 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60935-1|pmid=19447250 }}</ref> However, Africa, and specifically the African Highlands, are susceptible to being particularly negatively affected. In 2010, 91% of the global burden due to malaria deaths occurred in Africa. Several spatiotemporal models have been studied to assess the potential effect of projected climate scenarios on malaria transmission in Africa. A study conducted by Caminade et al.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1302089111 |pmid=24596427 |pmc=3948226 |title=Impact of climate change on global malaria distribution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=9 |pages=3286\u20133291 |year=2014 |last1=Caminade |first1=Cyril |last2=Kovats |first2=Sari |last3=Rocklov |first3=Joacim |last4=Tompkins |first4=Adrian M. |last5=Morse |first5=Andrew P. |last6=Col\u00f3n-Gonz\u00e1lez |first6=Felipe J. |last7=Stenlund |first7=Hans |last8=Martens |first8=Pim |last9=Lloyd |first9=Simon J. |bibcode=2014PNAS..111.3286C }}</ref> concluded that the most significant climate change effects are confined to specific regions, including the African Highlands. These results are consistent with previous studies.\n\nUltimately, studies show an overall increase in climate suitability for malaria transmission resulting in an increase in the population at risk of contracting the disease.<ref name=\":4\" /> Of significant importance is the increase of epidemic potential at higher altitudes (like the African Highlands). Rising temperatures in these areas have the potential to change normally non-malarial areas to areas with seasonal epidemics.<ref>Martens, W. J., Niessen, L. W., Rotmans, J., Jetten, T. H., & McMichael, A. J. (1995). The potential impact of global climate change on malaria risk. ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', ''103''(5), 458\u2013464.</ref> Consequently, new populations will be exposed to the disease resulting in healthy years lost. In addition, the disease burden may be more detrimental to areas that lack the ability and resources to effectively respond to such challenges and stresses.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2015.09.007 |pmid=26479830 |title=Impact of climate change on human infectious diseases: Empirical evidence and human adaptation |journal=Environment International |volume=86 |pages=14\u201323 |year=2016 |last1=Wu |first1=Xiaoxu |last2=Lu |first2=Yongmei |last3=Zhou |first3=Sen |last4=Chen |first4=Lifan |last5=Xu |first5=Bing |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==== ''Scientific Limitations'' ====\nScientific limitations when examining shifting malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands are similar to those related to broader understandings of climate change and malaria. While modeling with temperature changes shows that there is a relationship between an increase in temperature and an increase in malaria transmission, limitations still exist. Future population shifts that affect population density, as well as changes in the behavior of mosquitos, can affect transmission rates and are limiting factors in determining the future risk of malaria outbreaks, which also affect planning for correct outbreak response preparation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== ''Challenges and Solutions'' ====\nThe challenges of controlling and possibly eradicating malaria in the African Highlands are many and varied. Many of the strategies used to control malaria have not changed, are few in number and have rarely been added to in the last 20 years.\n\nThe most common forms of control are educating the public and vector control. The huge geographic area of the vectors ''Anopheles'' is possibly the largest challenge faced in the control of malaria. With such a large area to cover it is hard to use insecticides at a continuous and effective level.<ref name=\":5\">Osungbade, K. O., & Oladunjoye, O. O. (2012). Prevention of Congenital Transmission of Malaria in Sub- Saharan African Countries: Challenges and Implications for Health System        Strengthening. Journal of Tropical Medicine, 2012, 1-6. [[doi:10.1155/2012/648456]]</ref> This form of control is expensive, and the areas affected are not able to sustain control. Without sustained control, a rapid resurgence in parasite transmission is seen. Another challenge with insecticides is that the vector is now becoming insecticide-resistant. Due to the fact that mosquitoes have several generations per year, resistance is seen very quickly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nEducation has its limitations as well, as the population most affected by malaria are children, and the educational message is to stay inside during peak mosquito activity. The low socioeconomic status of the people who inhabit the African Highlands is also a challenge. Local health facilities have limited resources, and poor living conditions and malnourishment exacerbate malaria symptoms and increase the likelihood of death due to malaria.<ref name=\":5\" /> As climate change shifts geographic areas of transmission to the African Highlands, the challenge will be to find and control the vector in areas that have not seen it before, and to not waste resources on areas where the temperature is no longer conducive to parasite growth.<ref>Tanser, F. C., Sharp, B., & Sueur, D. L. (2003). The potential effect of climate change on malaria transmission in Africa. ''The Lancet, 362''(9398), 1792-1798. [[doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(03)14898-2]]</ref>\n\nThe solutions that can help malaria control and possibly lead to eradication are far fewer in number than the challenges, but if they are effective they can truly change the areas currently affected. There are number of groups working on a vaccine, some are looking to control the transmission of the parasite to the host, or control transmission from human back to the vector.<ref name=\":6\">Nunes, J.

But, the development is still progressing in the hopes of finding a better, more effective long-lasting vaccine.<ref name=\":6\" /> An alternative to vaccines is vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP) that is a form a gene therapy. This therapy will change cells in the host that will secrete antigens from various stages of the parasite in the hopes of triggering an anamnestic immune response in the recipient and prevent disease and parasite transmission.<ref>Rodrigues, M.

This research needs to take many forms, including attribution studies, to help clarify the degree to which malaria rates are attributed to climate change; scenario modeling, which can help further our understanding of future climate change consequences on malaria rates; and examinations of intervention programs and techniques, to help our understanding of what appropriate responses are.<ref name=\":8\" /> Surveillance and monitoring of malaria in populations in the African Highlands will also be important, to better understand disease.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBeyond these research priorities, it is also important that we enact policies that will significantly increase investments in public health in the African Highlands.

The recent drought in many African countries, which has been linked to climate change, adversely affected both energy security and economic growth across the continent.\n\n=== Agriculture and food security ===\nAgriculture is inherently sensitive to climate conditions and is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=L\u00e4derach|first=Peter|last2=Martinez-Valle|first2=Armando|last3=Bourgoin|first3=Clement|last4=Parker|first4=Louis|date=2019-03-27|title=Vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change: The development of a pan-tropical Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment to inform sub-national decision making|journal=PLOS One|volume=14|issue=3|pages=e0213641|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0213641|issn=1932-6203|pmc=6436735|pmid=30917146|bibcode=2019PLoSO..1413641P}}</ref> Agriculture in most\u00a0 African countries is mainly small-scale and rain-fed, making it particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change.

African countries need to build a national legal framework to manage food resources in accordance with the anticipated climate variability. However, before devising a policy to cope with the impacts of climate variability, especially to the agriculture sector, it is critical to have a clear understanding of how climate variability affects different food crops.\n\nIn the year 2020, sever invasion of [[Locust]]s harmed the agriculture in eastern Africa.

To improve understanding of past and future changes in water availability due to climate change, the IPCC (IPCC 2013) recommends using the dynamic downscaling technique. The IPCC 2013 proposed using the coordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX) regional climate models which runs at a maximum of 50&nbsp; km resolutions, the resolution used depends upon the size of the watershed and area coverage by the meteorological records. However, before using the climate simulations from the dynamic downscaling, it is appropriate to evaluate their performance at different spatial scales since their performance differs from one location to another and from one RCM to another.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{main|Effects of global warming on human health}}\nAfrican countries have the least efficient public health systems in the world.<ref name=\":12\">World Health Organization.

For instance, over 90 percent of annual global malaria cases are in Africa.<ref name=\":12\" /> Changes in climate will affect the spread of infectious agents as well as alter people\u2019s disposition to these infections.\n\n=== Energy ===\nWith increasing population and corresponding energy demand, energy security must be addressed because energy is crucial for sustainable development. Climate change has affected energy sectors in Africa as many countries depend on hydropower generation. Decreasing rainfall levels and droughts have resulted in lower water levels in dams with adverse impacts on hydropower generation. This has resulted in low electrical energy production, high cost of electricity and power outages or load-shedding in some African countries that depend on hydroelectric power generation. Disruptions in hydropower generation have negatively affected various sectors in countries such as Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania.\n\n=== Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ===\n\n== African Highlands ==\n\n=== Shifts in Malaria Transmission Due to Climate Change ===\nClimate change, and resulting in increased temperatures, storms, droughts, and rising sea levels, will affect the incidence and distribution of infectious disease across the globe.<ref name=\":0\">Beard, C.

If deforestation continues at its current rate, more land will be available for mosquito breeding grounds, and the population of mosquitos will rapidly increase. The increase in mosquitoes will thus increase the opportunity for both ''Plasmodium falciparum'' and ''Plasmodium vivax'' parasites to proliferate.\n\nExposure to malaria will become a greater risk to humans as the number of female ''Anopheles'' mosquitos infected with either the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' or ''Plasmodium vivax'' parasite increases.<ref name=\":3\" /> The mosquito will transmit the parasite to the human host through a bite, resulting in infection. Then, when an uninfected mosquito bites the now infected human host, the parasite will be transmitted to the mosquitoes which will then become an exposure to other uninfected human hosts. Individuals who are constantly exposed to the Malaria parasite due to multiple bites by mosquitoes that carry the parasite are at greater risk of dying.<ref name=\":2\" /> Infected humans can also transmit the disease to uninfected or healthy humans via contaminated blood.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== ''Health Effects'' ====\nThe health effects caused by shifts in malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands have the potential to be severe. Research has shown that the effects of climate change on health will impact most populations over the next few decades.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costello |first1=Anthony |last2=Abbas |first2=Mustafa |last3=Allen |first3=Adriana |last4=Ball |first4=Sarah |last5=Bell |first5=Sarah |last6=Bellamy |first6=Richard |last7=Friel |first7=Sharon |last8=Groce |first8=Nora |last9=Johnson |first9=Anne |last10=Kett |first10=Maria |last11=Lee |first11=Maria |last12=Levy |first12=Caren |last13=Maslin |first13=Mark |last14=McCoy |first14=David |last15=McGuire |first15=Bill |last16=Montgomery |first16=Hugh |last17=Napier |first17=David |last18=Pagel |first18=Christina |last19=Patel |first19=Jinesh |last20=de Oliveira |first20=Jose Antonio Puppim |last21=Redclift |first21=Nanneke |last22=Rees |first22=Hannah |last23=Rogger |first23=Daniel |last24=Scott |first24=Joanne |last25=Stephenson |first25=Judith |last26=Twigg |first26=John |last27=Wolff |first27=Jonathan |last28=Patterson |first28=Craig |title=Managing the health effects of climate change |journal=The Lancet |date=May 2009 |volume=373 |issue=9676 |pages=1693\u20131733 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60935-1|pmid=19447250 }}</ref> However, Africa, and specifically the African Highlands, are susceptible to being particularly negatively affected. In 2010, 91% of the global burden due to malaria deaths occurred in Africa. Several spatiotemporal models have been studied to assess the potential effect of projected climate scenarios on malaria transmission in Africa. A study conducted by Caminade et al.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1302089111 |pmid=24596427 |pmc=3948226 |title=Impact of climate change on global malaria distribution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=9 |pages=3286\u20133291 |year=2014 |last1=Caminade |first1=Cyril |last2=Kovats |first2=Sari |last3=Rocklov |first3=Joacim |last4=Tompkins |first4=Adrian M. |last5=Morse |first5=Andrew P. |last6=Col\u00f3n-Gonz\u00e1lez |first6=Felipe J. |last7=Stenlund |first7=Hans |last8=Martens |first8=Pim |last9=Lloyd |first9=Simon J. |bibcode=2014PNAS..111.3286C }}</ref> concluded that the most significant climate change effects are confined to specific regions, including the African Highlands. These results are consistent with previous studies.\n\nUltimately, studies show an overall increase in climate suitability for malaria transmission resulting in an increase in the population at risk of contracting the disease.<ref name=\":4\" /> Of significant importance is the increase of epidemic potential at higher altitudes (like the African Highlands). Rising temperatures in these areas have the potential to change normally non-malarial areas to areas with seasonal epidemics.<ref>Martens, W. J., Niessen, L. W., Rotmans, J., Jetten, T. H., & McMichael, A. J. (1995). The potential impact of global climate change on malaria risk. ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', ''103''(5), 458\u2013464.</ref> Consequently, new populations will be exposed to the disease resulting in healthy years lost. In addition, the disease burden may be more detrimental to areas that lack the ability and resources to effectively respond to such challenges and stresses.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2015.09.007 |pmid=26479830 |title=Impact of climate change on human infectious diseases: Empirical evidence and human adaptation |journal=Environment International |volume=86 |pages=14\u201323 |year=2016 |last1=Wu |first1=Xiaoxu |last2=Lu |first2=Yongmei |last3=Zhou |first3=Sen |last4=Chen |first4=Lifan |last5=Xu |first5=Bing |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==== ''Scientific Limitations'' ====\nScientific limitations when examining shifting malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands are similar to those related to broader understandings of climate change and malaria. While modeling with temperature changes shows that there is a relationship between an increase in temperature and an increase in malaria transmission, limitations still exist. Future population shifts that affect population density, as well as changes in the behavior of mosquitos, can affect transmission rates and are limiting factors in determining the future risk of malaria outbreaks, which also affect planning for correct outbreak response preparation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== ''Challenges and Solutions'' ====\nThe challenges of controlling and possibly eradicating malaria in the African Highlands are many and varied. Many of the strategies used to control malaria have not changed, are few in number and have rarely been added to in the last 20 years.\n\nThe most common forms of control are educating the public and vector control. The huge geographic area of the vectors ''Anopheles'' is possibly the largest challenge faced in the control of malaria. With such a large area to cover it is hard to use insecticides at a continuous and effective level.<ref name=\":5\">Osungbade, K. O., & Oladunjoye, O. O. (2012). Prevention of Congenital Transmission of Malaria in Sub- Saharan African Countries: Challenges and Implications for Health System        Strengthening. Journal of Tropical Medicine, 2012, 1-6. [[doi:10.1155/2012/648456]]</ref> This form of control is expensive, and the areas affected are not able to sustain control. Without sustained control, a rapid resurgence in parasite transmission is seen. Another challenge with insecticides is that the vector is now becoming insecticide-resistant. Due to the fact that mosquitoes have several generations per year, resistance is seen very quickly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nEducation has its limitations as well, as the population most affected by malaria are children, and the educational message is to stay inside during peak mosquito activity. The low socioeconomic status of the people who inhabit the African Highlands is also a challenge. Local health facilities have limited resources, and poor living conditions and malnourishment exacerbate malaria symptoms and increase the likelihood of death due to malaria.<ref name=\":5\" /> As climate change shifts geographic areas of transmission to the African Highlands, the challenge will be to find and control the vector in areas that have not seen it before, and to not waste resources on areas where the temperature is no longer conducive to parasite growth.<ref>Tanser, F. C., Sharp, B., & Sueur, D. L. (2003). The potential effect of climate change on malaria transmission in Africa. ''The Lancet, 362''(9398), 1792-1798. [[doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(03)14898-2]]</ref>\n\nThe solutions that can help malaria control and possibly lead to eradication are far fewer in number than the challenges, but if they are effective they can truly change the areas currently affected. There are number of groups working on a vaccine, some are looking to control the transmission of the parasite to the host, or control transmission from human back to the vector.<ref name=\":6\">Nunes, J.

But, the development is still progressing in the hopes of finding a better, more effective long-lasting vaccine.<ref name=\":6\" /> An alternative to vaccines is vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP) that is a form a gene therapy. This therapy will change cells in the host that will secrete antigens from various stages of the parasite in the hopes of triggering an anamnestic immune response in the recipient and prevent disease and parasite transmission.<ref>Rodrigues, M.

This research needs to take many forms, including attribution studies, to help clarify the degree to which malaria rates are attributed to climate change; scenario modeling, which can help further our understanding of future climate change consequences on malaria rates; and examinations of intervention programs and techniques, to help our understanding of what appropriate responses are.<ref name=\":8\" /> Surveillance and monitoring of malaria in populations in the African Highlands will also be important, to better understand disease.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBeyond these research priorities, it is also important that we enact policies that will significantly increase investments in public health in the African Highlands.
