A fourth plane never arrived at its target, crashing in a field in Pennsylvania after a passenger revolt. The intended target is believed to have been either the [[United States Capitol]] or the [[White House]]. As a result, 2,977 victims were killed, making it the deadliest terrorist attack on [[United States|U.S. soil]]; also the deadliest foreign attack on U.S. soil, exceeding [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor|surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], on December 7, 1941, which killed 2,403 victims. It was carefully planned by [[al-Qaeda]], who sent 19 terrorists to take over [[Boeing 757]] and [[Boeing 767]] aircraft, operated by [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Al-Qaeda]]'s origins date back to 1979 when the [[Soviet Union]] invaded [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"gunaratna\">{{cite book |author=Gunaratna, Ronan |title=Inside Al Qaeda |year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books}}</ref> Soon after the invasion, [[Osama bin Laden]] traveled to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab [[mujahideen]]. Together with [[Abdullah Azzam]], a Palestinian-Jordanian who influenced bin Laden, they formed [[Maktab al-Khidamat]] (MAK) in 1984, to provide support for Arab [[mujahideen]] who came to join the [[jihad]] in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"gunaratna\"/>\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, the Soviets were retreating in defeat. Bin Laden and Azzam had discussions about the future of MAK and what to do with the mujahideen force that had built up. Bin Laden and Azzam both wanted to use the force as a \"rapid reaction force\" to defend oppressed Muslims around the world.  Bin Laden wanted to train the mujahideen in terrorist tactics, while Azzam strongly disagreed with this approach, issuing a ''fatwa'' saying that it would violate Islamic law.  Azzam reiterated the hadith that orders Muslims not to kill any women or children.<ref name=\"gunaratna-p29\">{{cite book |author=Gunaratna, Ronan |title=Inside Al Qaeda |year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books |pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1989, soon after bin Laden and Azzam split, Azzam was killed in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]].  Azzam and his two sons were travelling to [[Jummah]] (Friday prayer) when a remote-control activated bomb detonated and killed them.  It is not known for certain if bin Laden was behind this, but thought unlikely.  Nonetheless, bin Laden was free to take full control of MAK, laying the groundwork for al-Qaeda.<ref name=\"gunaratna-p31\">{{cite book |author=Gunaratna, Ronan |title=Inside Al Qaeda|year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books |page=31}}</ref>  Under the guidance of Dr. [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], bin Laden became more radical.<ref name=\"gunaratna-p33\">{{cite book |author=Gunaratna, Ronan |title=Inside Al Qaeda |year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books |page=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, bin Laden moved to [[Sudan]], where he led operations in [[East Africa]], including the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|1993 assault]] on U.S. troops at [[Mogadishu]] in [[Somalia]].  Under international pressure, the Sudanese forced bin Laden out of Sudan in 1996, and he returned to Afghanistan.\n\n===Ideology===\n{{Main|Motivations of the September 11 attacks}}\nThe [[Gulf War|Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990 marked a point where bin Laden turned his attention toward the [[United States]]. He strongly urged the Saudi regime not to host the 500,000 U.S. soldiers, instead advocating the use of a mujaheddin force to oust the Iraqis. Bin Laden strongly opposed the continued presence of U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia. He interpreted the Prophet [[Muhammad]] as banning the \"permanent presence of infidels in Arabia\".<ref name=\"holywar-p3\">{{cite book |author=Bergen, Peter L. |title=Holy War Inc. |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2001 |page=3}}</ref> This drove bin Laden to attack U.S. military targets in [[Saudi Arabia]].

Bin Laden also objected to U.S. alliances with the governments of [[Kuwait]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]].\n\nHe viewed Israelis as [[infidel]]s who are not welcome in \"Muslim land\".  He objected to [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in relation to [[Israel]]. He noted that key figures [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Sandy Berger]], and [[William Cohen]], who were all [[Jewish]], \"drove Washington's undoubtedly pro-Israel policy\" during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].<ref name=\"holywar-p5\">{{cite book |last=Bergen|first=Peter L.|title=Holy War Inc.|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2001 |page=5}}</ref>\n\n===Fatwas===\nIn 1996, bin Laden issued a [[fatwa]], calling for the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] to leave [[Saudi Arabia]]. In Islam, a fatwa can only be given by an Islamic scholar; however, Osama bin Laden was a political fighter who used Islam to motivate his fighters. The [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. Embassy bombings]] marked a turning point, with bin Laden intent on attacking the U.S.<ref>9/11 Commission Report,[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec5.pdf Chapter 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711025016/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec5.pdf |date=2007-07-11 }}</ref> Bin Laden issued another fatwa in February 1998, together with [[Ayman al Zawahiri]], declaring war against the U.S. Bin Laden stated \"We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they [Americans] are all targets.\" Bin Laden cited grievances including the presence of U.S. infidels (soldiers) in the Saudi Arabian holy land, the suffering of the Iraqi people due to sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf War, and U.S. support of [[Israel]]. In his December 1999 interview with [[Rahimullah Yusufzai]], bin Laden reiterated his ideology and objected to U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. He proclaimed that the U.S. was \"too near to Mecca\", which he considered a provocation to the entire Muslim world.<ref name=\"guardian-20010926\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,558075,00.html|title=Face to face with Osama|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 26, 2001|location=London|accessdate=May 22, 2010|first=Rahimullah|last=Yusufzai|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119011449/http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0%2C3604%2C558075%2C00.html|archive-date=January 19, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> He also believed Israel \"was killing and punishing Palestinians with American money and American arms.\"<ref name=\"guardian-20010926\"/>\n\n==Origins of the September 11 attacks==\n[[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] first presented the idea for the September 11 plot to bin Laden in 1996 in Afghanistan.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3128802.stm Suspect 'reveals 9/11 planning'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225172402/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3128802.stm%20 |date=2018-12-25 }}, BBC News</ref> However, nothing came of the idea at the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAccording to the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|September 11 Commission]], Khalid Sheikh Mohammed envisioned a hijacking of twelve airplanes on both the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West]] coasts, and for eleven of them to be crashed into the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] and the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]]; [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]; the [[Prudential Tower]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]; the [[White House]] and the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Willis Tower]] (then Sears Tower) in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]; the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] (then Library Tower) in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]; the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]; and the [[Columbia Center]] in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]].<ref>{{cite paper| title=Outline of the 9-11 Plot, Staff Statement No. 16| page=13| publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks| url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_16.pdf| date=June 16, 2004| accessdate=September 23, 2004| url-status=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923223416/http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_16.pdf| archivedate=September 23, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kiger |first=Patrick J. |date=September 7, 2011 |title=The Original Plans for 9/11 |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2011/09/07/the-original-plans-for-911/ |work=National Geographic |accessdate=September 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905125513/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2011/09/07/the-original-plans-for-911/ |archive-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] Counterterrorist Center reported to President [[Bill Clinton]] that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the U.S., including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Bin Ladin Preparing to Hijack US Aircraft and Other Attacks\n |date         = 1998-12-04\n |accessdate   = 2018-08-31\n |publisher    = [[Director of Central Intelligence]]\n |url          = https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001110635.pdf\n |url-status   = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170606053220/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001110635.pdf\n |archive-date = 2017-06-06\n}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1998 or early 1999, bin Laden summoned Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to [[Kandahar]] and gave approval for Mohammed to go forward with the plot.<ref name=\"911-ch5\"/>\n\nA series of meetings occurred in spring of 1999, involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and his deputy [[Mohammed Atef]].<ref name=\"911-ch5\"/>  Bin Laden recommended four individuals for the plot, including [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], [[Walid Muhammad Salih Bin 'Attash]] (Khallad), and [[Abu Bara al-Taizi]].

The two men wanted to take flight lessons, which is why they got the money. A friend took them to [[Montgomery Field]] and arranged lessons for them. They took a single flight lesson and did not return. Fereidoun \"Fred\" Sorbi, the instructor, recalled, \"The first day they came in here, they said they want to fly Boeings.

Bin Laden and Azzam had discussions about the future of MAK and what to do with the mujahideen force that had built up. Bin Laden and Azzam both wanted to use the force as a \"rapid reaction force\" to defend oppressed Muslims around the world.  Bin Laden wanted to train the mujahideen in terrorist tactics, while Azzam strongly disagreed with this approach, issuing a ''fatwa'' saying that it would violate Islamic law.  Azzam reiterated the hadith that orders Muslims not to kill any women or children.<ref name=\"gunaratna-p29\">{{cite book |author=Gunaratna, Ronan |title=Inside Al Qaeda |year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books |pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1989, soon after bin Laden and Azzam split, Azzam was killed in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]].  Azzam and his two sons were travelling to [[Jummah]] (Friday prayer) when a remote-control activated bomb detonated and killed them.  It is not known for certain if bin Laden was behind this, but thought unlikely.  Nonetheless, bin Laden was free to take full control of MAK, laying the groundwork for al-Qaeda.<ref name=\"gunaratna-p31\">{{cite book |author=Gunaratna, Ronan |title=Inside Al Qaeda|year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books |page=31}}</ref>  Under the guidance of Dr. [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], bin Laden became more radical.<ref name=\"gunaratna-p33\">{{cite book |author=Gunaratna, Ronan |title=Inside Al Qaeda |year=2002 |publisher=Berkley Books |page=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, bin Laden moved to [[Sudan]], where he led operations in [[East Africa]], including the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|1993 assault]] on U.S. troops at [[Mogadishu]] in [[Somalia]].  Under international pressure, the Sudanese forced bin Laden out of Sudan in 1996, and he returned to Afghanistan.\n\n===Ideology===\n{{Main|Motivations of the September 11 attacks}}\nThe [[Gulf War|Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990 marked a point where bin Laden turned his attention toward the [[United States]]. He strongly urged the Saudi regime not to host the 500,000 U.S. soldiers, instead advocating the use of a mujaheddin force to oust the Iraqis. Bin Laden strongly opposed the continued presence of U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia. He interpreted the Prophet [[Muhammad]] as banning the \"permanent presence of infidels in Arabia\".<ref name=\"holywar-p3\">{{cite book |author=Bergen, Peter L. |title=Holy War Inc. |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2001 |page=3}}</ref> This drove bin Laden to attack U.S. military targets in [[Saudi Arabia]].

Bin Laden also objected to U.S. alliances with the governments of [[Kuwait]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]].\n\nHe viewed Israelis as [[infidel]]s who are not welcome in \"Muslim land\".  He objected to [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in relation to [[Israel]].
