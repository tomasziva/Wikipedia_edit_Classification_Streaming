In 1989, [[Nike Inc.]] designer [[Tinker Hatfield]] was asked to create a shoe for the [[Back to the Future Part II|second installment]] of the series, which was partly set in the then-futuristic year of 2015.

He and footwear innovator Tiffany Beers  (designer of the [[Nike Kyrie]] sneaker line)  worked on the redesign  for approximately six years and had to restart about three times. After thousands of hours of work, the shoes were a replica of the 1989 Nike MAG worn by [[Marty McFly]]. The shoes feature an [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] out-sole, space age materials, and a rechargeable internal battery good for 3,000 hours. They are the first rechargeable pair of footwear by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].
