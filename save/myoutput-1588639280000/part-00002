At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.\n\nBecause of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the [[Mandelbrot set]] in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\" or \"chaotic\", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\".<ref name=\"Wolfram\" /> His math and geometry-centered research career included contributions to such fields as [[statistical physics]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]], [[anatomy]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[neurology]], [[linguistics]], [[information technology]], [[computer graphics]], [[economics]], [[geology]], [[medicine]], [[physical cosmology]], [[engineering]], [[chaos theory]], [[econophysics]], [[metallurgy]] and the [[social science]]s.<ref>list includes specific sciences mentioned in [[#Hudson|Hudson & Mandelbrot]], the Prelude, p.&nbsp;xvi, and p.&nbsp;26</ref>\n\nToward the end of his career, he was [[Sterling Professor]] of Mathematical Sciences at [[Yale University]], where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to receive tenure.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Olson | url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2004_11/mandelbrot.html |title=The Genius of the Unpredictable |publisher=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=November\u2013December 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2014| author-link=Steve Olson (writer) }}</ref> Mandelbrot also held positions at the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], [[Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France]], [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]].

Building on previous work by [[Gaston Julia]] and [[Pierre Fatou]], Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the [[Mandelbrot set]] which was introduced by him in 1979. In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ4qiEBNP4gC&printsec=frontcover ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature''], by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman & Co, 1982; {{isbn|0-7167-1186-9}}</ref> This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as \"[[Artifact (observational)|program artifacts]]\".\n\n[[File:Mandelbrot p1130876.jpg|thumb|right|Mandelbrot speaking about the [[Mandelbrot set]], during his acceptance speech for the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 2006]]\n\nIn 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term ''[[fractal]]'' to describe these structures and first published his ideas, and later translated, ''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension''.<ref>''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension'', by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman and Co, 1977; {{isbn|0-7167-0473-0}}</ref> According to computer scientist and physicist [[Stephen Wolfram]], the book was a \"breakthrough\" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically \"apply fairly straightforward mathematics \u2026 to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before\".<ref name=Wolfram>Wolfram, Stephen.

Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphic computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like \"the delirious exuberance of the 1960s [[psychedelic art]] with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body\". He also saw himself as a \"would-be Kepler\", after the 17th-century scientist [[Johannes Kepler]], who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.<ref>Ivry, Benjamin.

He concluded that \"real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.\"<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|296}} Although Mandelbrot coined the term \"fractal\", some of the mathematical objects he presented in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'' had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, \"rough\" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:\n{{quote|The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer \u2026 bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling \u2026 and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|292}}}}\n\nFractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and [[stock market]] prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional [[Euclidean geometry]]: <blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2014Mandelbrot, in his introduction to ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''</blockquote>\n[[File:Mandel zoom 08 satellite antenna.jpg|thumb|right|Section of a Mandelbrot set]]\n\nMandelbrot has been called a work of art, and a visionary<ref name=\"RLD\">{{cite web|author=Devaney, Robert L.|authorlink= Robert L.

The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics.\n\nMandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of [[Olbers' paradox]] (the \"dark night sky\" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient, but not necessary]], resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the [[star]]s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like [[Cantor dust]]), it would not be necessary to rely on the [[Big Bang]] theory to explain the paradox.

After [[World War II]] ended, Mandelbrot studied mathematics, graduating from universities in Paris and the United States and receiving a master's degree in [[aeronautics]] from the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He spent most of his career in both the United States and France, having [[Multiple citizenship|dual]] [[French nationality law|French]] and [[United States nationality law#Dual citizenship|American]] citizenship. In 1958, he began a 35-year career at [[IBM]], where he became an [[IBM Fellow]], and periodically took leaves of absence to teach at [[Harvard University]].  At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.\n\nBecause of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the [[Mandelbrot set]] in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\" or \"chaotic\", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\".<ref name=\"Wolfram\" /> His math and geometry-centered research career included contributions to such fields as [[statistical physics]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]], [[anatomy]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[neurology]], [[linguistics]], [[information technology]], [[computer graphics]], [[economics]], [[geology]], [[medicine]], [[physical cosmology]], [[engineering]], [[chaos theory]], [[econophysics]], [[metallurgy]] and the [[social science]]s.<ref>list includes specific sciences mentioned in [[#Hudson|Hudson & Mandelbrot]], the Prelude, p.&nbsp;xvi, and p.&nbsp;26</ref>\n\nToward the end of his career, he was [[Sterling Professor]] of Mathematical Sciences at [[Yale University]], where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to receive tenure.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Olson | url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2004_11/mandelbrot.html |title=The Genius of the Unpredictable |publisher=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=November\u2013December 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2014| author-link=Steve Olson (writer) }}</ref> Mandelbrot also held positions at the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], [[Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France]], [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]].

Building on previous work by [[Gaston Julia]] and [[Pierre Fatou]], Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the [[Mandelbrot set]] which was introduced by him in 1979. In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ4qiEBNP4gC&printsec=frontcover ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature''], by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman & Co, 1982; {{isbn|0-7167-1186-9}}</ref> This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as \"[[Artifact (observational)|program artifacts]]\".\n\n[[File:Mandelbrot p1130876.jpg|thumb|right|Mandelbrot speaking about the [[Mandelbrot set]], during his acceptance speech for the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 2006]]\n\nIn 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term ''[[fractal]]'' to describe these structures and first published his ideas, and later translated, ''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension''.<ref>''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension'', by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman and Co, 1977; {{isbn|0-7167-0473-0}}</ref> According to computer scientist and physicist [[Stephen Wolfram]], the book was a \"breakthrough\" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically \"apply fairly straightforward mathematics \u2026 to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before\".<ref name=Wolfram>Wolfram, Stephen.

No matter how close you look, they never get simpler, much as the section of a rocky coastline you can see at your feet looks just as jagged as the stretch you can see from space.<ref name=Wolfram />}}\n\nWolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, \"in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other, so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole. Fern leaves and Romanesco broccoli are two examples from nature.\"<ref name=Wolfram /> He points out an unexpected conclusion:\n\n{{quote|One might have thought that such a simple and fundamental form of regularity would have been studied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphic computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like \"the delirious exuberance of the 1960s [[psychedelic art]] with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body\". He also saw himself as a \"would-be Kepler\", after the 17th-century scientist [[Johannes Kepler]], who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.<ref>Ivry, Benjamin.

He concluded that \"real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.\"<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|296}} Although Mandelbrot coined the term \"fractal\", some of the mathematical objects he presented in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'' had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, \"rough\" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:\n{{quote|The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer \u2026 bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling \u2026 and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|292}}}}\n\nFractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and [[stock market]] prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional [[Euclidean geometry]]: <blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2014Mandelbrot, in his introduction to ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''</blockquote>\n[[File:Mandel zoom 08 satellite antenna.jpg|thumb|right|Section of a Mandelbrot set]]\n\nMandelbrot has been called a work of art, and a visionary<ref name=\"RLD\">{{cite web|author=Devaney, Robert L.|authorlink= Robert L.

He offered in 1974 a new explanation of [[Olbers' paradox]] (the \"dark night sky\" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient, but not necessary]], resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the [[star]]s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like [[Cantor dust]]), it would not be necessary to rely on the [[Big Bang]] theory to explain the paradox.
