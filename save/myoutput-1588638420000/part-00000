Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, a commissioner on the panel, admonished Sheriff Israel stating that \"Words matter, and according to your policy, he did not have to go in\". Judd was referring to Scot Peterson, the former Broward Sheriff's Office deputy assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a [[School resource officer|school resource officer]] who resigned after it was revealed that he had not entered the building to engage the shooter. Peterson had waited outside the building with his gun drawn while shots were being fired inside. Sheriff Israel's admission that he changed the verbiage of the active shooter policy clashed with his own statements at a news conference nine months earlier, just days after the shooting, when Sheriff Israel announced that Deputy Peterson was being suspended without pay because \"He never went in.\" At the time of the shooting on February 14, 2018, Israel's re-written active shooter policy in effect on the day of the shooting provided that Deputy Peterson did not have to go in, but that information had not been brought to the public light until the commission meeting on November 15.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-ne-israel-stoneman-douglas-commission-20181115-story.html|title=Sheriff Israel defends agency's performance in Parkland shooting|last=Fleshler|first=David|website=Sun-Sentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/nikolas-cruz-florida-shooting.html|title=As Gunman Rampaged Through Florida School, Armed Deputy 'Never Went In'|last=Blinder|first=Alan|date=February 22, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-24|last2=Mazzei|first2=Patricia|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> \n\nDuring the commission meeting as Sheriff Israel was being questioned, another Florida sheriff on the panel brought up that several of Israel's deputies on the scene of the shooting failed to take command, and seemed disengaged, or failed to act at all, driving back and forth outside the school during the shooting, or they were distracted, which eventually led to more disciplinary action against these deputies.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Criticism and suspension==\nSheriff Israel was criticized by his political opponents,<ref name=\"sunsentinel\">{{cite news|title=Sheriff's hiring of political supporters under fire|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-sheriff-political-hires-20160827-story.html|author=Brittany Wallman|accessdate=March 4, 2018|publisher=Tronc publications|date=27 August 2016}}</ref>  who accused him of hiring his political supporters to work in \"community outreach\" jobs that consisted mostly of going to meetings and touting the Sheriff's Department's success.
