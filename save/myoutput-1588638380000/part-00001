Extreme physical appearances in selectively bred animals may cause health problems, which may cause wild ancestors to have longer natural lifespans.\n\n====\u00a0Behavioral ====\nBehavioral differences in wild ancestors were caused by differences in brain structures compared to its domesticated counterparts.

The level of intelligence of modern humans are considerably higher compared to the hominid ancestors from millions of years ago. Among which during this time the volume of the hominid brain began to gradually increase starting from about 600&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo habilis]]'' up to 1500&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''. Although the evolution of humans increases the level intelligence, the same may not be observed in other animals, especially animals which has great dependence to humans. an example for this is seen in dogs. While different breeds of modern dogs possess different brain capacity and intelligence, in general, compared to the wolf, the dogs problem solving capabilities has declined. In a problem solving experiment, the average success rate for dogs are 5% while the wolves obtained an 80% success rate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Udell MA | title = When dogs look back: inhibition of independent problem-solving behaviour in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) compared with wolves (Canis lupus) | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 20150489 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26382070 | pmc = 4614426 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2015.0489 }}</ref> On the other hand, in a test on guinea pigs, it was shown that the spatial ability of domestic guiniea pigs are higher compared to its ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewejohann L, Pickel T, Sachser N, Kaiser S | title = Wild genius - domestic fool?

As wild ancestor species evolves there are certain genes which would indicate its evolutionary path. Creatures which would undergo domestication has changes in genes which alter its endocrine system and hormonal production which could be seen in animals such domesticated birds, canids, cattle and house pets. This could be seen in the mutation of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor gene (TSHR) in domesticated chicken, which affects the reproduction system. In the domestic fox experiment, the gene SorCS1 was found in tame foxes but not in aggressive foxes, this gene is thought to be responsible for the tameness trait in domestic foxes.\n\n====Differences\u00a0 in plants ====\nPlants that are bred for crops or food production are selectively bred for increased effectivity, and relatively better taste. Hence, the differences in wild ancestors and cultivated modern crops will reflect that, for example, an increased size of the edible parts of certain fruits.\n\nDomestication syndrome in plants causes differences such as larger sizes, changes in colour and differences in sugar content. Adaptability of modern plants might also be increased compared to its wild ancestor.\n\nCultivated plants shows differences in chemical content compared to its wild counterparts. For example, research has shown that cultivated plants generally produce litters which decomposes faster and are easier to be recycled compared to wild plants. Wild plants, which had to generally thrive in nutrient poor soils promotes a higher content of recalcitrant molecules, such as lignin. This stimulates an increase in plant litter toughness, causing it to decompose longer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Garc\u00eda-Palacios P, Milla R, Delgado-Baquerizo M, Mart\u00edn-Robles N, Alvaro-S\u00e1nchez M, Wall DH | title = Side-effects of plant domestication: ecosystem impacts of changes in litter quality | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 198 | issue = 2 | pages = 504\u201313 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23356416 | doi = 10.1111/nph.12127 }}</ref>\n\nother differences may include :\n\n* loss of seed dormancy   \n* new adaptations to ecological factors such as nutrient composition in the soil, temperature, acidity, light levels, humidity, etc.)    \n* difference in method of reproduction (e.g. lack of pollinating organs, depending on human intervention) or even sterility in modern plants.   \n* differences in chemical composition (e.g. increase in vitamins, sugar content, etc.)   \n* loss of seed dispersal methods    \n* a decrease in defensive mechanisms. Since traits such as thorns, spines, protective coverings and poison are less desirable to humans. it is lost to artificial selection. This renders modern plants more susceptible to pests.\n* difference in disease susceptibility.\n\n== Uses ==\nThere are uses of coexisting wild ancestors and its domestic counterparts. The existence of a wild ancestor may be used to increase biodiversity of the variety of species.  it mainly helps with conservation but may also be used for genetic improvements, though this practice is mainly done on plants, more specifically food producing crops. Since wild crops generally have a higher pest resistance, breeding plant hybrids would significantly improve the quality of the cultivated crops. The same technique may be applied to increase bacterial resistance, plant yield, and resistance to biotic stress.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hajjar |first1=Reem |last2=Hodgkin |first2=Toby |title=The use of wild relatives in crop improvement: a survey of developments over the last 20 years |journal=Euphytica |date=9 February 2007 |volume=156 |issue=1-2 |pages=1\u201313 |doi=10.1007/s10681-007-9363-0}}</ref>\n\n== List of wild ancestors and modern counterparts ==\n{{further|List of domesticated animals|List of domesticated plants}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!Species and subspecies\n!Wild ancestor\n|-\n|[[Dog]] (''Canis familiaris'')<ref>Gentry, A.; Clutton-Brock, J.; [[Colin Groves|Groves, C.

Among which during this time the volume of the hominid brain began to gradually increase starting from about 600&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo habilis]]'' up to 1500&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> in ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''. Although the evolution of humans increases the level intelligence, the same may not be observed in other animals, especially animals which has great dependence to humans. an example for this is seen in dogs. While different breeds of modern dogs possess different brain capacity and intelligence, in general, compared to the wolf, the dogs problem solving capabilities has declined. In a problem solving experiment, the average success rate for dogs are 5% while the wolves obtained an 80% success rate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Udell MA | title = When dogs look back: inhibition of independent problem-solving behaviour in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) compared with wolves (Canis lupus) | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 20150489 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26382070 | pmc = 4614426 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2015.0489 }}</ref> On the other hand, in a test on guinea pigs, it was shown that the spatial ability of domestic guiniea pigs are higher compared to its ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewejohann L, Pickel T, Sachser N, Kaiser S | title = Wild genius - domestic fool?

As wild ancestor species evolves there are certain genes which would indicate its evolutionary path. Creatures which would undergo domestication has changes in genes which alter its endocrine system and hormonal production which could be seen in animals such domesticated birds, canids, cattle and house pets. This could be seen in the mutation of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor gene (TSHR) in domesticated chicken, which affects the reproduction system. In the domestic fox experiment, the gene SorCS1 was found in tame foxes but not in aggressive foxes, this gene is thought to be responsible for the tameness trait in domestic foxes.\n\n====Differences\u00a0 in plants ====\nPlants that are bred for crops or food production are selectively bred for increased effectivity, and relatively better taste. Hence, the differences in wild ancestors and cultivated modern crops will reflect that, for example, an increased size of the edible parts of certain fruits.\n\nDomestication syndrome in plants causes differences such as larger sizes, changes in colour and differences in sugar content. Adaptability of modern plants might also be increased compared to its wild ancestor.\n\nCultivated plants shows differences in chemical content compared to its wild counterparts. For example, research has shown that cultivated plants generally produce litters which decomposes faster and are easier to be recycled compared to wild plants. Wild plants, which had to generally thrive in nutrient poor soils promotes a higher content of recalcitrant molecules, such as lignin. This stimulates an increase in plant litter toughness, causing it to decompose longer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Garc\u00eda-Palacios P, Milla R, Delgado-Baquerizo M, Mart\u00edn-Robles N, Alvaro-S\u00e1nchez M, Wall DH | title = Side-effects of plant domestication: ecosystem impacts of changes in litter quality | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 198 | issue = 2 | pages = 504\u201313 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23356416 | doi = 10.1111/nph.12127 }}</ref>\n\nother differences may include :\n\n* loss of seed dormancy   \n* new adaptations to ecological factors such as nutrient composition in the soil, temperature, acidity, light levels, humidity, etc.)    \n* difference in method of reproduction (e.g. lack of pollinating organs, depending on human intervention) or even sterility in modern plants.   \n* differences in chemical composition (e.g. increase in vitamins, sugar content, etc.)   \n* loss of seed dispersal methods    \n* a decrease in defensive mechanisms. Since traits such as thorns, spines, protective coverings and poison are less desirable to humans. it is lost to artificial selection. This renders modern plants more susceptible to pests.\n* difference in disease susceptibility.\n\n== Uses ==\nThere are uses of coexisting wild ancestors and its domestic counterparts. The existence of a wild ancestor may be used to increase biodiversity of the variety of species.  it mainly helps with conservation but may also be used for genetic improvements, though this practice is mainly done on plants, more specifically food producing crops. Since wild crops generally have a higher pest resistance, breeding plant hybrids would significantly improve the quality of the cultivated crops. The same technique may be applied to increase bacterial resistance, plant yield, and resistance to biotic stress.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hajjar |first1=Reem |last2=Hodgkin |first2=Toby |title=The use of wild relatives in crop improvement: a survey of developments over the last 20\u00a0years |journal=Euphytica |date=9 February 2007 |volume=156 |issue=1-2 |pages=1\u201313 |doi=10.1007/s10681-007-9363-0 }}</ref>\n\n== List of wild ancestors and modern counterparts ==\n{{further|List of domesticated animals|List of domesticated plants}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!Species and subspecies\n!Wild ancestor\n|-\n|[[Dog]] (''Canis familiaris'')<ref>Gentry, A.; Clutton-Brock, J.; [[Colin Groves|Groves, C.
