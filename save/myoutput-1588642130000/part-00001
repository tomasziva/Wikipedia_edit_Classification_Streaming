[[Edd China]] served as the programmes mechanic for series 1 to 13; he was replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.\n\nThe programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.\n\nThere have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]].\n\nThe previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]]. Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. \n\nBeginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.\n\nIn April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.\n\n== Format ==\nIn each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was \u00a31,000, for series 2, \u00a32,000, and for series 3, \u00a33,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a \u00a310,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to \u00a320,000\".\n\nThe presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.\n\nAlso addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].\n\n=== Part one ===\n* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.\n\n* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.\n\n* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7).\n\n* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.\n\n* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.\n\n* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.\n\n=== Part two ===\n* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).\n\n* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.\n\n* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.\n\n*(This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)\n\n* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.\n\n* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.\n* There is a final tally of expenditures.\n\n* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)\n\n* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling).\n* The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.\n\n* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.\n\n[[Edd China]] as the show's mechanic from series 1 to 13 doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs.\n \nOn 21 March 2017 Velocity announced that China had left the show to \"pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. He explained that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel which wanted to cut down his fixes in the workshop. \n\nAs since series 13 the programme is produced by [[Discovery Studios]] (instead of Attaboy TV for the 12 previous seasons for Motor Trend).\n\n[[Discovery Communications]] has strengthened its control on Wheeler Dealers and according to China it would seem it found its production too expensive.\n\nPaul Brackley the series technical advisor, made sporadic appearances to assist China in carrying heavy parts or equipment in the garage, when China needed additional assistance (such as when China was bleeding brake/clutch fluid or checking an exhaust while a vehicle was running), and helping Brewer tow non-running or non-MOT-compliant vehicles to the shop.\n\n=== Guest appearances on other shows ===\nWhile buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on [[Chip Foose]] during the 2 June 2013 episode of [[Overhaulin]] where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 [[Lotus Europa]] he was customising.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Wheeler Dealers episodes}}\n\nAs of 27 April 2020 174 episodes have been shown covering 174 different vehicles with 10 recap episodes.\n\n=== ''Wheeler Dealers'' ===\nFor series 1 to 6, each car was covered in two half an hour episodes (including ad breaks). From series 7 onwards, each car was covered in a single 60 minute episode.\n\n===Series Overview===\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n\n| color1       = #000066\n| link1        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 1 (2003)\n| episodes1    = 6\n| start1       = {{Start date|2003|10|7|df=y}}\n| end1         = {{End date|2003|11|11|df=y}}\n\n| color2       = #BFBFBF\n| link2        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 2 (2004)\n| episodes2    = 6\n| start2       = {{Start date|2004|8|10|df=y}}\n| end2         = {{End date|2004|9|16|df=y}}\n\n| color3       = #545480\n| link3        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 3 (2005)\n| episodes3    = 6\n| start3       = {{Start date|2005|8|23|df=y}}\n| end3         = {{End date|2005|9|27|df=y}}\n\n| color4       = #006161\n| link4        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 4 (2006)\n| episodes4    = 6\n| start4       = {{Start date|2006|8|29|df=y}}\n| end4         = {{End date|2006|10|3|df=y}}\n\n| color5       = #A69482\n| link5        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 5 (On the Road) (2008)\n| episodes5    = 6\n| start5       = {{Start date|2008|10|28|df=y}}\n| end5         = {{End date|2008|12|6|df=y}}\n\n| color6       = #559CDA\n| link6        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 6 (2009)\n| episodes6    = 10\n| start6       = {{Start date|2009|5|5|df=y}}\n| end6         = {{End date|2009|11|17|df=y}}\n\n| color7       = #44546A\n| link7        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 7 (2010)\n| episodes7    = 10\n| start7       = {{Start date|2010|5|4|df=y}}\n| end7         = {{End date|2010|11|9|df=y}}\n\n| color8       = #F0E68C\n| link8        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 8 (2011)\n| episodes8    = 10\n| start8       = {{Start date|2011|4|5|df=y}}\n| end8         = {{End date|2011|11|1|df=y}}\n\n| color9       = #99324F\n| link9        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 9 (2013)\n| episodes9    = 15\n| start9       = {{Start date|2012|3|20|df=y}}\n| end9         = {{End date|2012|11|6|df=y}}\n\n| color10       = #3A3838\n| link10        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 10 (2013)\n| episodes10    = 12\n| start10       = {{Start date|2013|2|19|df=y}}\n| end10         = {{End date|2013|10|22|df=y}}\n\n| color11       = #36614B\n| link11        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 11 (2014)\n| episodes11    = 14\n| start11       = {{Start date|2014|3|17|df=y}}\n| end11         = {{End date|2014|10|13|df=y}}\n\n| color12       = #694F6E\n| link12        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 12 (2015)\n| episodes12    = 18\n| start12       = {{Start date|2015|3|23|df=y}}\n| end12         = {{End date|2015|10|19|df=y}}\n\n| color13       = #006161\n| link13        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 13 (2016-17)\n| episodes13    = 16\n| start13       = {{Start date|2016|5|9|df=y}}\n| end13         = {{End date|2017|1|16|df=y}}\n\n| color14       = #a6b7ce\n| link14        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 14 (2017)\n| episodes14    = 16\n| start14       = {{Start date|2017|10|5|df=y}}\n| end14         = {{End date|2018|5|31|df=y}}\n\n| color15       = #83cebf\n| link15        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 15 (2018)\n| episodes15    = 24\n| start15       = {{Start date|2018|10|3|df=y}}\n| end15         = {{End date|2019|12|3|df=y}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width: 40%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Series\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=5% | Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n|-\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series premiere\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series finale\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#9932CC;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 1 (2013)|1]]'''\n| 6\n| 2 April 2013\n| 7 May 2013\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#25262a;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 2 (2014)|2]]'''\n| 6\n| 6 August 2014\n| 10 September 2014\n|}\n\n=== Sweden Special ===\nOn 2 April 2012, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] version of the Discovery Channel aired a special episode called ''Wheeler Dealers Sverige Special'' (''Wheeler Dealers Sweden Special'').

For Hire Cars, he rented a Black [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006\u2013present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] in the UK, a black [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] in Brazil, a dark red [[GMC Yukon]] in Texas, a grey [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 3 / LR3|Land Rover Discovery 3]] in Poland, and a white [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]] in Italy. In Poland, when Brewer is taking the Fiat 126p to get vinyl wrapped, he borrowed a grey [[Opel Movano]], to carry the car to the vinyl wrapping shop.\n\nFor the ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' US specials, Brewer stood in China's shop, in front of a red [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].\n\n=== Intro/segment vehicles ===\nThe opening sequences and filler segments from series 1 to 9 featured the cars that were worked on throughout their corresponding seasons:\n\n*Series 1: All the vehicles done so far\n*Series 2 and 3: MGB GT\n*Series 4: Porsche 911 2.7S Targa\n*Series 5: Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL\n*Series 6: Ferrari Dino 308 GT4\n*Series 7: Lotus Elan S3\n*Series 8a: Jaguar E-Type Series 3\n*Series 8b: Dodge Charger\n*Series 9a: Fiat Dino\n*Series 9b: Gardner Douglas Cobra\n\nSeries 10 did away with using cars on the opening and commercial break sequences, instead using a title card with the series logo and the colour(s) of the episode's car on the background. The filler segments, however, used the following cars:\n\n*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7\n*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S\n\nStarting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.\n\n==International productions==\nThe popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC D\u00e9couverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aur\u00e9lien Letheux. Brewer made a special guest appearance on season 2 episode 1 of the series.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Deals on Wheels]]'' - An earlier programme presented by Brewer with a similar premise.\n*''[[Salvage Hunters]]'' - A similar concept series, related to buying and selling [[antique]]s\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://wheelerdealers.discoveryuk.com}} ([[Discovery (UK and Ireland)|Discovery UK]])\n* {{Official website|https://watch.motortrend.com/tv-shows/wheeler-dealers/}} ([[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]])\n* {{YouTube|u=WheelerDealersTV|''{{PAGENAMEBASE}}''|suffix='}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British television series]]\n[[Category:2003 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Automotive television series]]\n[[Category:Discovery Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration of vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the 1963 film|The Wheeler Dealers}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox television\n | show_name = Wheeler Dealers\n | image = WheelerDealersTitleCard.jpg\n | caption = Series 14 title card\n | show_name_2 = Wheeler Dealers: On the Road <small>(Series 5)</small>\n | country = [[United Kingdom]]\n | network = [[Discovery Real Time]] <small>(2003-2010)</small><br/>[[Discovery Channel]] <small>(2011-2015)</small><br/> [[Motor Trend]]<small> (2016-present)</small>\n | creator = Daniel Allum<br/>Michael Wood\n | presenter = [[Mike Brewer]]<br/>[[Edd China]] <small>(Series 1-13)</small><br/>[[Ant Anstead]] <small>(Series 14-)</small>\n | num_series = 15 <small>(Wheeler Dealers)</small><br>2 <small>(Trading Up)</small>\n | num_episodes = 173 + 9 Specials <small>(as of 13 April 2020) </small> \n | list_episodes = List of Wheeler Dealers episodes\n | runtime = 30 minutes <small>(Series 1-6)</small><br/>60 minutes <small>(Series 7-)</small>\n | first_aired = {{Start date|2003|10|7|df=y}}\n | last_aired = present\n | company    = Attaboy TV <small>(Series 1-12)</small><br/>[[Discovery Studios]]\n | opentheme = [[Balaclava]]\n | theme_music_composer = [[The Wideboys]]\n}}\nWheeler Dealers is a British television series originally produced by Attaboy TV for the [[Discovery Channel]] in the UK and [[Motor Trend]] in the U.S. The programme is fronted by car enthusiast [[Mike Brewer]]. [[Edd China]] served as the programmes mechanic for series 1 to 13; he was replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.\n\nThe programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.\n\nThere have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]].\n\nThe previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]]. Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. \n\nBeginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.\n\nIn April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.\n\n== Format ==\nIn each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was \u00a31,000, for series 2, \u00a32,000, and for series 3, \u00a33,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a \u00a310,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to \u00a320,000\".\n\nThe presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.\n\n=== Summary ===\nThe programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.\n\nAlso addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].\n\n=== Part one ===\n* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.\n\n* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.\n\n* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7).\n\n* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.\n\n* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.\n\n* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.\n\n=== Part two ===\n* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).\n\n* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.\n\n* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.\n\n*(This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)\n\n* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.\n\n* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.\n* There is a final tally of expenditures.\n\n* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)\n\n* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling).\n* The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.\n\n* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.\n\n*(Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.\n\n[[Edd China]] as the show's mechanic from series 1 to 13 doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs.\n \nOn 21 March 2017 Velocity announced that China had left the show to \"pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. He explained that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel which wanted to cut down his fixes in the workshop. \n\nAs since series 13 the programme is produced by [[Discovery Studios]] (instead of Attaboy TV for the 12 previous seasons for [[Motor Trend.\n\n[[Discovery Communications]] has strengthened its control on Wheeler Dealers and according to China it would seem it found its production too expensive.\n\nPaul Brackley the series technical advisor, made sporadic appearances to assist China in carrying heavy parts or equipment in the garage, when China needed additional assistance (such as when China was bleeding brake/clutch fluid or checking an exhaust while a vehicle was running), and helping Brewer tow non-running or non-MOT-compliant vehicles to the shop.\n\n=== Guest appearances on other shows ===\nWhile buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on [[Chip Foose]] during the 2 June 2013 episode of [[Overhaulin]] where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 [[Lotus Europa]] he was customising.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Wheeler Dealers episodes}}\n\nAs of 27 April 2020 174 episodes have been shown covering 174 different vehicles with 10 recap episodes.\n\n=== ''Wheeler Dealers'' ===\nFor series 1 to 6, each car was covered in two half an hour episodes (including ad breaks). From series 7 onwards, each car was covered in a single 60 minute episode.\n\n===Series Overview===\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n\n| color1       = #000066\n| link1        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 1 (2003)\n| episodes1    = 6\n| start1       = {{Start date|2003|10|7|df=y}}\n| end1         = {{End date|2003|11|11|df=y}}\n\n| color2       = #BFBFBF\n| link2        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 2 (2004)\n| episodes2    = 6\n| start2       = {{Start date|2004|8|10|df=y}}\n| end2         = {{End date|2004|9|16|df=y}}\n\n| color3       = #545480\n| link3        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 3 (2005)\n| episodes3    = 6\n| start3       = {{Start date|2005|8|23|df=y}}\n| end3         = {{End date|2005|9|27|df=y}}\n\n| color4       = #006161\n| link4        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 4 (2006)\n| episodes4    = 6\n| start4       = {{Start date|2006|8|29|df=y}}\n| end4         = {{End date|2006|10|3|df=y}}\n\n| color5       = #A69482\n| link5        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 5 (On the Road) (2008)\n| episodes5    = 6\n| start5       = {{Start date|2008|10|28|df=y}}\n| end5         = {{End date|2008|12|6|df=y}}\n\n| color6       = #559CDA\n| link6        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 6 (2009)\n| episodes6    = 10\n| start6       = {{Start date|2009|5|5|df=y}}\n| end6         = {{End date|2009|11|17|df=y}}\n\n| color7       = #44546A\n| link7        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 7 (2010)\n| episodes7    = 10\n| start7       = {{Start date|2010|5|4|df=y}}\n| end7         = {{End date|2010|11|9|df=y}}\n\n| color8       = #F0E68C\n| link8        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 8 (2011)\n| episodes8    = 10\n| start8       = {{Start date|2011|4|5|df=y}}\n| end8         = {{End date|2011|11|1|df=y}}\n\n| color9       = #99324F\n| link9        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 9 (2013)\n| episodes9    = 15\n| start9       = {{Start date|2012|3|20|df=y}}\n| end9         = {{End date|2012|11|6|df=y}}\n\n| color10       = #3A3838\n| link10        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 10 (2013)\n| episodes10    = 12\n| start10       = {{Start date|2013|2|19|df=y}}\n| end10         = {{End date|2013|10|22|df=y}}\n\n| color11       = #36614B\n| link11        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 11 (2014)\n| episodes11    = 14\n| start11       = {{Start date|2014|3|17|df=y}}\n| end11         = {{End date|2014|10|13|df=y}}\n\n| color12       = #694F6E\n| link12        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 12 (2015)\n| episodes12    = 18\n| start12       = {{Start date|2015|3|23|df=y}}\n| end12         = {{End date|2015|10|19|df=y}}\n\n| color13       = #006161\n| link13        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 13 (2016-17)\n| episodes13    = 16\n| start13       = {{Start date|2016|5|9|df=y}}\n| end13         = {{End date|2017|1|16|df=y}}\n\n| color14       = #a6b7ce\n| link14        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 14 (2017)\n| episodes14    = 16\n| start14       = {{Start date|2017|10|5|df=y}}\n| end14         = {{End date|2018|5|31|df=y}}\n\n| color15       = #83cebf\n| link15        = <includeonly>List of Wheeler Dealers episodes</includeonly>#Series 15 (2018)\n| episodes15    = 24\n| start15       = {{Start date|2018|10|3|df=y}}\n| end15         = {{End date|2019|12|3|df=y}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width: 40%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=5% |Series\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=5% | Episodes\n!colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n|-\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series premiere\n! style=\"width: 20%;\"|Series finale\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#9932CC;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 1 (2013)|1]]'''\n| 6\n| 2 April 2013\n| 7 May 2013\n|-\n| style=\"width:5px; background:#25262a;\"|\n| '''[[#Series 2 (2014)|2]]'''\n| 6\n| 6 August 2014\n| 10 September 2014\n|}\n\n=== Sweden Special ===\nOn 2 April 2012, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] version of the Discovery Channel aired a special episode called ''Wheeler Dealers Sverige Special'' (''Wheeler Dealers Sweden Special'').

When he returned to France in series 12b, he rented a French-registered grey [[Audi Q3]] to purchase the Citro\u00ebn HY.\n\n=== ''Trading Up'' ===\nFor ''Trading Up'', Brewer drove a white [[Toyota Fortuner]] owned by a used car dealer in India.

The filler segments, however, used the following cars:\n\n*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7\n*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S\n\nStarting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.\n\n==International productions==\nThe popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC D\u00e9couverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aur\u00e9lien Letheux. Brewer made a special guest appearance on season 2 episode 1 of the series.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Deals on Wheels]]'' - An earlier programme presented by Brewer with a similar premise.\n*''[[Salvage Hunters]]'' - A similar concept series, related to buying and selling [[antique]]s\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://wheelerdealers.discoveryuk.com}} ([[Discovery (UK and Ireland)|Discovery UK]])\n* {{Official website|https://watch.motortrend.com/tv-shows/wheeler-dealers/}} ([[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]])\n* {{YouTube|u=WheelerDealersTV|''{{PAGENAMEBASE}}''|suffix='}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British television series]]\n[[Category:2003 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Automotive television series]]\n[[Category:Discovery Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration of vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "QuadColour", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast:fixed typos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Dealers"}
