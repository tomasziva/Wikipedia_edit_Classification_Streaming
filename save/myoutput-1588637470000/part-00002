It was designed and built by the Scottish-Norwegian shipwright [[Colin Archer]] for Fridtjof Nansen's 1893 Arctic expedition in which the plan was to freeze ''Fram''  into the [[Arctic ice]] sheet and float with it over the [[Geographic North Pole|North Pole]].\n\n''Fram'' is said{{by who|date=April 2018}} to have sailed farther north (85\u00b057'N) and farther south (78\u00b041'S) than any other wooden ship. ''Fram'' is preserved at the [[Fram Museum]] in [[Oslo]], Norway.\n\n==Construction==\nNansen's ambition was to explore the [[Arctic]] farther north than anyone else. To do that, he would have to deal with a problem that many sailing on the polar ocean had encountered before him: the freezing ice could crush a ship. Nansen's idea was to build a ship that could survive the pressure, not by pure strength, but because it would be of a shape designed to let the ice push the ship up, so it would \"float\" on top of the ice.\n[[File:Fram 1893-1896 engineering drawing.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Engineering drawings]]\n\n''Fram'' is a three-masted [[schooner]] with a total length of 39 meters and width of 11 meters. The ship is both unusually wide and unusually shallow in order to better withstand the forces of pressing ice.\n\nNansen commissioned the shipwright [[Colin Archer]] from [[Larvik]] to construct a vessel with these characteristics. ''Fram'' was built with an outer layer of [[Chlorocardium rodiei|greenheart]] wood to withstand the ice and with almost no [[keel]] to handle the shallow waters Nansen expected to encounter. The [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] were designed to be retracted. The ship was also carefully insulated to allow the crew to live on board for up to five years. The ship also included a [[windmill]], which ran a generator to provide electric power for lighting by [[Arc lamp|electric arc lamps]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Nansen | first = Fridtjof | authorlink = Fridtjof Nansen | year = 1897 | title = Farthest North, Volumes I and II | chapter=ch 2 | publisher = Archibald Constable & Co. | location = London | ref = {{sfnRef|Nansen}} | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30197}}</ref>\n\nInitially, ''Fram'' was fitted with a steam engine. Prior to Amundsen's expedition to the South Pole in 1910, the engine was replaced with a diesel engine, a first for polar exploration vessels.\n\n==Expeditions==\n''Fram'' was used in several expeditions:\n[[File:Framprow.jpg|thumb|150px|The prow of ''Fram'', as seen in the [[Fram Museum]] in 2010.]]\n\n===Nansen's 1893\u20131896 Arctic expedition===\n{{main|Nansen's Fram expedition}}\nWreckage found at Greenland from {{USS|Jeannette|1878|6}}, which was lost off Siberia, and driftwood found in the regions of [[Svalbard]] and [[Greenland]], suggested that an [[ocean current]] flowed beneath the Arctic ice sheet from east to west, bringing driftwood from the [[Siberia]]n region to Svalbard and further west. Nansen had ''Fram'' built in order to explore this theory.\n\n[[File:PSM V57 D433 The ship named fram.png|thumb|left|''Fram'' in port, circa 1900<ref>[[Wikisource:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 57/August 1900/The Evolution and Present Status of the Automobile]]</ref>\n]]\nHe undertook an expedition that came to last three years. When Nansen realised that ''Fram'' would not reach the North Pole directly by the force of the current, he and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] set out to reach it on skis. After reaching 86\u00b0 14' north, he had to turn back to spend the winter at [[Franz Joseph Land]]. Nansen and Johansen survived on [[walrus]] and [[polar bear]] meat and [[blubber]]. Finally meeting British explorers, the [[Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition]], they arrived back in Norway only days before the ''Fram'' also returned there. The ship had spent nearly three years trapped in the ice, reaching 85\u00b0 57' N.<ref>[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]], ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'', Carroll & Graf Publishers, 1922, p. xxii</ref>\n\n===Sverdrup's 1898\u20131902 Canadian Arctic islands expedition===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Sverdrup]], who had brought ''Fram'' back on the first Arctic voyage, led a scientific expedition to the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]. ''Fram'' was slightly modified for this journey, its [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] being increased. ''Fram'' left harbour on 24 June 1898, with 17 men on board. Their aim was to chart the lands of the Arctic Islands, and to sample the geology, flora and fauna.
