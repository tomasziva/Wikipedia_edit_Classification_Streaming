His father died in September 1920, a month before Kimathi was born. Kimathi was raised by his mother, Waibuthi, one of his father's three wives. He had two brothers, Wambararia and Wagura, and two sisters. At the age of fifteen, he enrolled at the local primary school, Karuna-ini, where he perfected his [[English language|English]]. He continued his education in the secondary school Tumutumu CMS School. He was a passionate writer, and wrote extensively before and during the Mau Mau uprising. He was a Debate Club member in his school and also showed ability in poetry. Kimathi balked at any efforts to discipline or control him, and was constantly in trouble with his teachers;<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.287\">David Anderson, Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire (2005) p.287</ref> as a result, he drifted in and out of the educational system.\n\nIn 1940, Kimathi enlisted in the [[British Army]], but was discharged after a month, allegedly for drunkenness and persistent violence against his fellow recruits.<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.287\"/> He moved from job to job, from swineherd to primary school teacher, from which he was dismissed after accusations of violence against his pupils.<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.287\"/>\n\n==Mau Mau movement==\n{{Disputed-section|date=April 2020}}\nAround 1947 or 1948, whilst working in [[Ol Kalou]], Kimathi came into contact with members of the [[Kenya African Union]] (KAU). By 1950 he had become secretary to the KAU branch at Ol Kalou, which was controlled by militant supporters of the [[Mau Mau uprising|Mau Mau]] cause. The Mau Mau began as the Land and Freedom Army (KLFA), a militant [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Embu people|Embu]] and [[Ameru|Meru]] army which sought to reclaim land, which the British settlers had gradually stripped away from them. As the group's influence and membership widened it became a major threat to the colonial government.\n\nUpon taking the [[oath]] of the Mau Mau, Kimathi in 1951 joined the [[Forty Group]], the militant wing of the defunct [[Kikuyu Central Association]]. As branch secretary, Kimathi presided over oath-taking. He believed in compelling fellow Kikuyu by way of oath to bring solidarity to the independence movement. To achieve this he administered beatings and carried a double-barrelled shotgun.<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.288\">David Anderson, Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire (2005) p.288\n</ref> His activities with the group made him a target of the colonial government, and he was briefly arrested that same year but escaped with the help of local police. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the uprising, and he formed the Kenya Defence Council to co-ordinate all forest fighters in 1953.\n\nThirty-two settlers and about 100 British soldiers were killed by the Mau Mau,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} but many of Kimathi's most brutal attacks were aimed at members of the [[Kikuyu_people|Kikuyu tribe]], the largest ethnic group in Kenya, who remained loyal to the colonial administration. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1421970/Honour-for-Mau-Mau-leader-who-ate-victims.html |title=Honour for Mau Mau leader who ate victims |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2003-02-13 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> The young son of a chief who refused to join was cut in two by Kimathi's men, who drank his blood before flinging the two halves of the body at the boy's mother who was then killed.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} Hundreds of others who defied Kimathi were hacked to death. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1421970/Honour-for-Mau-Mau-leader-who-ate-victims.html |title=Honour for Mau Mau leader who ate victims |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2003-02-13 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> Many who did join underwent horrific initiation ceremonies: After being forced to drink human blood, semen and urine, recruits would in some cases be ordered to eat human brains, sometimes of their relatives, as well as the flesh of recently exhumed or murdered babies.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1421970/Honour-for-Mau-Mau-leader-who-ate-victims.html |title=Honour for Mau Mau leader who ate victims |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2003-02-13 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Ian |date=1958 |title='Man-hunt in Kenya' |url=https://archive.org/details/manhuntinkenya00hend|url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |page=[https://archive.org/details/manhuntinkenya00hend/page/13 13] |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Kimathi's brutality to his own side caused a constant stream of deserters to inform on him to [[Ian_Henderson_(police_officer)|Ian Henderson]], the officer in charge of the man-hunt, which only accelerated Kimathi's capture. <ref>{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Ian |date=1958 |title='Man-hunt in Kenya |url=https://archive.org/details/manhuntinkenya00hend|url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = What some others thought of him is summed up in the words of a surrendered terrorist from Fort Hall who said, \"Nobody has helped the government as much as Kimathi, and for that reason he should be given a salary.

Mandela's request was an embarrassing moment for the Moi administration, which had largely ignored Kimathi, like Jomo Kenyatta's government before it. It was an awkward moment searching for her in the village where she and her family lived forgotten in poverty. Mandela's request was not met. During a public address at the [[Kasarani Stadium]] in Nairobi before he left the country, Mandela stated his admiration for Kimathi, [[Musa Mwariama]], [[Waruhiu Itote]] and other Mau Mau leaders who inspired his own struggle against injustice.

His capture in 1956 and execution the next year led to the decline of the uprising against the British colonial government.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koinange|first1=Machua|title=My encounter with the man who shot Dedan Kimathi|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000095871/my-encounter-with-the-man-who-shot-dedan-kimathi?articleID=2000095871&story_title=my-encounter-with-the-man-who-shot-dedan-kimathi&pageNo=1|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Standard Media Kenya|publisher=The Standard|date=20 October 2013}}</ref> Before his execution, he wrote that he was \"...so busy and so happy preparing for heaven tomorrow.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/weekend/How-Dedan-Kimathi-spent-his-last-days/1220-3836548-56t1ff/index.html|title=Shadows of October: How Dedan Kimathi spent his last days|website=Daily Nation|language=en|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\nKenyan [[nationalism|nationalists]] view him as the heroic figurehead of the Kenyan freedom struggle against [[British Kenya|British colonial rule]], while the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] saw him as a [[terrorism|terrorist]].<ref>Branch, Daniel: ''Defeating Mau Mau, Creating Kenya: Counterinsurgency, Civil War, and Decolonization''.

His father died in September 1920, a month before Kimathi was born. Kimathi was raised by his mother, Waibuthi, one of his father's three wives. He had two brothers, Wambararia and Wagura, and two sisters. At the age of fifteen, he enrolled at the local primary school, Karuna-ini, where he perfected his [[English language|English]]. He continued his education in the secondary school Tumutumu CMS School. He was a passionate writer, and wrote extensively before and during the Mau Mau uprising. He was a Debate Club member in his school and also showed ability in poetry. Kimathi balked at any efforts to discipline or control him, and was constantly in trouble with his teachers;<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.287\">David Anderson, Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire (2005) p.287</ref> as a result, he drifted in and out of the educational system.\n\nIn 1940, Kimathi enlisted in the [[British Army]], but was discharged after a month, allegedly for drunkenness and persistent violence against his fellow recruits.<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.287\"/> He moved from job to job, from swineherd to primary school teacher, from which he was dismissed after accusations of violence against his pupils.<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.287\"/>\n\n==Mau Mau movement==\n{{Disputed-section|date=April 2020}}\nAround 1947 or 1948, whilst working in [[Ol Kalou]], Kimathi came into contact with members of the [[Kenya African Union]] (KAU). By 1950 he had become secretary to the KAU branch at Ol Kalou, which was controlled by militant supporters of the [[Mau Mau uprising|Mau Mau]] cause. The Mau Mau began as the Land and Freedom Army (KLFA), a militant [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Embu people|Embu]] and [[Ameru|Meru]] army which sought to reclaim land, which the British settlers had gradually stripped away from them. As the group's influence and membership widened it became a major threat to the colonial government.\n\nUpon taking the [[oath]] of the Mau Mau, Kimathi in 1951 joined the [[Forty Group]], the militant wing of the defunct [[Kikuyu Central Association]]. As branch secretary, Kimathi presided over oath-taking. He believed in compelling fellow Kikuyu by way of oath to bring solidarity to the independence movement. To achieve this he administered beatings and carried a double-barrelled shotgun.<ref name=\"David Anderson 2005 p.288\">David Anderson, Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire (2005) p.288\n</ref> His activities with the group made him a target of the colonial government, and he was briefly arrested that same year but escaped with the help of local police. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the uprising, and he formed the Kenya Defence Council to co-ordinate all forest fighters in 1953.\n\nThirty-two settlers and about 100 British soldiers were killed by the Mau Mau,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} but many of Kimathi's most brutal attacks were aimed at members of the [[Kikuyu_people|Kikuyu tribe]], the largest ethnic group in Kenya, who remained loyal to the colonial administration. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1421970/Honour-for-Mau-Mau-leader-who-ate-victims.html |title=Honour for Mau Mau leader who ate victims |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2003-02-13 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> The young son of a chief who refused to join was cut in two by Kimathi's men, who drank his blood before flinging the two halves of the body at the boy's mother who was then killed.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} Hundreds of others who defied Kimathi were hacked to death. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1421970/Honour-for-Mau-Mau-leader-who-ate-victims.html |title=Honour for Mau Mau leader who ate victims |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2003-02-13 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> Many who did join underwent horrific initiation ceremonies: After being forced to drink human blood, semen and urine, recruits would in some cases be ordered to eat human brains, sometimes of their relatives, as well as the flesh of recently exhumed or murdered babies.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1421970/Honour-for-Mau-Mau-leader-who-ate-victims.html |title=Honour for Mau Mau leader who ate victims |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2003-02-13 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Ian |date=1958 |title='Man-hunt in Kenya' |url=https://archive.org/details/manhuntinkenya00hend|url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |page=[https://archive.org/details/manhuntinkenya00hend/page/13 13] |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Kimathi's brutality to his own side caused a constant stream of deserters to inform on him to [[Ian_Henderson_(police_officer)|Ian Henderson]], the officer in charge of the man-hunt, which only accelerated Kimathi's capture. <ref>{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Ian |date=1958 |title='Man-hunt in Kenya |url=https://archive.org/details/manhuntinkenya00hend|url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = What some others thought of him is summed up in the words of a surrendered terrorist from Fort Hall who said, \"Nobody has helped the government as much as Kimathi, and for that reason he should be given a salary.

Mandela's request was an embarrassing moment for the Moi administration, which had largely ignored Kimathi, like Jomo Kenyatta's government before it. It was an awkward moment searching for her in the village where she and her family lived forgotten in poverty. Mandela's request was not met. During a public address at the [[Kasarani Stadium]] in Nairobi before he left the country, Mandela stated his admiration for Kimathi, [[Musa Mwariama]], [[Waruhiu Itote]] and other Mau Mau leaders who inspired his own struggle against injustice.
