The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers it was observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continues on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, implying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Most of the invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from these layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> It contains  several marine dinoflagellate cysts, Foraminiferal linings and a relatively di verse trace fossil, such as [[Planolites]], [[Palaeophycus]], [[Helminthopsis]], [[Gyrochorte]], [[Protovirgularia]], [[Spongeliomorpha]] and [[Diplocraterion]] associated with pyrite mineralization.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/><ref name=storms/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a palatine alluvial progradation.

Those relations made attribute the strata to deposition on a warm and really humid climate, with dominant swampy or marshy environments, along brackish-marine environments, consisting of [[lagoon]]s, [[embayment]]s, [[estuaries]], [[mangrove]]s, low-energy deltas and near sand wave fields or barrier islands, similar to the modern [[Caribbean Sea]] islands and seashore environments.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref>\n \nThe high presence of Kaolinite on the strata of the formation suggest a biochemical weathering in Tropical or Humid-subtropical climate with perennial rainfall, as modern Kaolinite deposits are typically present Humid Jungle settings.<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> Finds across Europe on Toarcian strata suggest that the formation of [[Kaolinite]] in tropical soils and its deposition in marine sediments could be almost contemporaneous during the Early Jurassic in the [[Peritethyan Domain]].<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> In the middle part of the Ciechocinek Formation, as expose the abundant amount of Kaolinite show that was develop as a result of intense humidity of the environments, with the increasing presence of several fossils and minerals on the strata outside the measurements of the iron precipitation.<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> Organic matter is of [[Type III Kerogen]], with fragments of microscopic plants and several traces of organic matter.

They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with an admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to the pure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are rare or extremely rare.

The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers it was observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continues on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, implying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Most of the invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from these layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> It contains  several marine dinoflagellate cysts, Foraminiferal linings and a relatively di verse trace fossil, such as [[Planolites]], [[Palaeophycus]], [[Helminthopsis]], [[Gyrochorte]], [[Protovirgularia]], [[Spongeliomorpha]] and [[Diplocraterion]] associated with pyrite mineralization.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/><ref name=storms/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a palatine alluvial progradation. The sea left seashore lakes, lagoons, deltas, Mangroves, with the emergence of the land confirmed by the occurrence of plant roots and [[desiccation crack]]s.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> This is also showed on the changes on the fauna present, where the trace fossils get more abundant, specially [[Planolites]] and there is appearance of phyllopods of the genus [[Estheria (crustacean)]], reflecting decline in water salinity.<ref name=storms/>\n\n==Paleoenvironment==\n[[File:Ciechocinek Formation Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|450px|left|Environment reconstruction of the Polish realm, based on several footprints, fragmentary specimens and fossil plants reported]]\n\nThe Ciechocinek Formation on the Polish Basin mainly represents a large and shallow brackish embayment, with a lower part  deposited in a restricted offshore environment, with lagoonal, deltaic and other seashore deposits, that translate to a deeper, nearly fully-marine environment in the Pomeranian region.<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> The Presence of abundant clay on the marine deposits suggest a great flux of terrestrial facies.<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> There is a significant diagenetic overprint (especially illitization of [[Smectite]]), with  burial depths up to 2000 m, with mostly of the studied sediments not been buried more than 1500-2000 m, what indicates that the Toarcian sediments wheren\u00b4t modified on a visible scale by Thermal [[Diagenesis]].<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI>BRA\u0143SKI, P.

Those relations made attribute the strata to deposition on a warm and really humid climate, with dominant swampy or marshy environments, along brackish-marine environments, consisting of [[lagoon]]s, [[embayment]]s, [[estuaries]], [[mangrove]]s, low-energy deltas and near sand wave fields or barrier islands, similar to the modern [[Caribbean Sea]] islands and seashore environments.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref>\n \nThe high presence of Kaolinite on the strata of the formation suggest a biochemical weathering in Tropical or Humid-subtropical climate with perennial rainfall, as modern Kaolinite deposits are typically present Humid Jungle settings.<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> Finds across Europe on Toarcian strata suggest that the formation of [[Kaolinite]] in tropical soils and its deposition in marine sediments could be almost contemporaneous during the Early Jurassic in the [[Peritethyan Domain]].<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> In the middle part of the Ciechocinek Formation, as expose the abundant amount of Kaolinite show that was develop as a result of intense humidity of the environments, with the increasing presence of several fossils and minerals on the strata outside the measurements of the iron precipitation.<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/> Organic matter is of [[Type III Kerogen]], with fragments of microscopic plants and several traces of organic matter.

There was a decline in rainfalls towards the [[Tenuicostatum]]-[[Falciferum]] boundary, exposing a transition to less humid conditions, noted by the decreasing amount of Kaolinite.<ref name=BRA\u0143SKI/>\n\n===Biota & Wildfires===\nThe organic matter found includes the oldest known [[Biomolecule]]s ([[Labdanoic Acid]], [[Ferruginol]], [[Sugiol]] and [[7-Oxototarol]]) from the  \u201cBlanowice brown coals\u201d, what probe the presence of abundant [[Wildfire]]s and/or peat fires on the formation, with the [[Cupressaceae]] and/or [[Podocarpaceae]] families the main peat-forming plant species.<ref>Rybicki, M., Marynowski, L., Misz-Kennan, M., & Simoneit, B.
