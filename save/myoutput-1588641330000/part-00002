Fern\u00e1ndez''' (June 30, 1944 \u2013 February 18, 1966) was a [[United States Army]] soldier in the [[Vietnam War]] who received the U.S. military's highest decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]]. Fern\u00e1ndez was awarded the medal for his actions in [[H\u1eadu Ngh\u0129a]] province, [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]], in February 1966 &mdash; throwing himself on a live grenade, he sacrificed his life to save lives of the soldiers around him.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], on June 30, 1944, Fern\u00e1ndez grew up in nearby [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]].<ref name=\"citation\"/><ref name=\"vcnb20101113\"/> He had two younger brothers, Peter and James, and a sister Rita.<ref name=\"vcnb20101113\"/>\n\nFern\u00e1ndez joined the Army from Albuquerque in 1962<ref>[http://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=48130 Service Profile]</ref> and by 1966 was on his second tour of duty in Vietnam. During that deployment, he served as a [[Specialist (rank)|specialist four]] in Company C, 1st Battalion, [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized)]], [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]]. On February 18, 1966, in [[C\u1ee7 Chi district, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City|C\u1ee7 Chi]], H\u1eadu Ngh\u0129a province, his 16-man patrol was ambushed by a [[Viet Cong]] rifle company and forced to fall back. Fern\u00e1ndez and two others volunteered to follow a sergeant back to the ambush site and rescue a wounded soldier who had been left behind. After reaching the injured man, the sergeant was shot in the knee and Fern\u00e1ndez took over command of the patrol. All five men were pinned down by heavy fire when a [[rifle grenade]] landed in their midst. In the scramble to get away from the device, Fern\u00e1ndez accidentally kicked it closer to the rest of the group. He then shouted \"move out\", jumped over the immobile sergeant, and threw himself on the grenade. He was killed in the resulting explosion, but successfully saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.<ref name=\"citation\"/><ref name=\"vcnb20101113\"/>\n\nFor this action, Fern\u00e1ndez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in November 1966.<ref name=\"vcnb20101113\"/> He was the first of nine [[Mexican American]]s to receive the medal in Vietnam.<ref name=\"contreras\"/>\n\n==Medal of Honor==\nHis official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\n{{quotebox|For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
