In later years it was made into a mausoleum for the most important heroes of that war. It is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Mexico City, and it has become a focal point for both celebration and protest. It resembles the [[July Column]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Berlin Victory Column]] in [[Berlin]].\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Winged vic mxc.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''[[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]'' on Column top]]<!-- Victory is ALWAYS winged -->\nThe base of the column is quadrangular with each vertex featuring a [[bronze]] sculpture symbolizing [[law]], [[war]], [[justice]] and [[peace]]. Originally, nine steps led to the base, but due to the sinking of the ground, an ongoing problem in Mexico City,  fourteen more steps have been added.\n\nOn the main face of the base facing downtown Mexico City, an inscription reads ''La Naci\u00f3n a los H\u00e9roes de la Independencia'' (\"The Nation to the Heroes of Independence\"). In front of this inscription is a bronze statue of a giant, laureled lion that guides a child, which symbolizes, according to Rivas Mercado, \"the Mexican people, strong during war and docile during peace.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zorrilla|first=Bego\u00f1a|date=August 2010|title=El \u00c1ngel de Independencia|url=|journal=Mexican\u00edsimo|volume=30|pages=53|via=}}</ref>\n\nNext to the column is a group of [[marble]] statues of some of the heroes of the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]].

The  [[corinthian order|Corinthian]]-style capital is adorned by four eagles with extended wings from the [[Mexican coat of arms]] used at the time.\n\nCrowning the column is a {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} statue by [[Enrique Alciati]] of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[Winged Victory of Samothrace|Victory]]. Like other similar victory columns around the world, it is made of bronze covered with 24[[Carat (purity)|k]] [[gold]] (restored in 2006), and weighs seven tons. In her right hand the Angel, as it is commonly known, holds a [[Bay laurel|laurel]] crown symbolically above both [[Miguel Hidalgo]]'s head and the nation below, symbolizing Victory, while in her left she holds a broken chain, symbolizing Freedom.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Centenario9_columna_inauguracion.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Inauguration of the Independence Monument, 1910]]\n[[File:009520-003 DA\u00d1OS DEL SISMO DEL D\u00cdA 28 JULIO 29 1957 (30953952424).jpg|thumb|Fallen of the sculpture of the monument after 1957 Mexico earthquake.]]\nConstruction of the column of independence topped by a depiction of winged victory was ordered in 1900 by [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]].

But in May 1906, when the foundations were built and 2,400 stones placed to a height of 25 m, the sides of the monument collapsed, so D\u00edaz created a study commission composed of engineers Guillermo Beltr\u00e1n y Puga, Manuel Marroqu\u00edn y Rivera, and Gonzalo Garita. The commission determined that the foundations of the monument were poorly planned, so it was decided to demolish the structure. The work was restarted under the supervision of a [[steering committee]] composed of engineers Beltran y Puga, Marroquin y Rivera and the architect Manuel Gorozpe, leaving the artwork in the care of architect [[Antonio Rivas Mercado]]. All the sculptures were made by [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Enrique Alciati]].

The inauguration was held on 16 September, the 100th anniversary of the ''[[Grito de Dolores]]'', the shout by Father [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]] that was considered the initiation of Mexican independence.  The ceremony was attended by President D\u00edaz and many foreign dignitaries. Some 10,000 Mexican soldiers and contingents of foreign military forces helped mark the occasion.<ref>D\u00edaz Flores Alatorre, Manuel.

Sculptor [[Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Urbina]] was in charge of the restoration, which lasted more than a year. The monument was reopened on September 16, 1958. It survived the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|devastating earthquake]] of September 19, 1985, with some damage to the staircases and the reliefs, but none to the ''Angel''.\n\nOn August 16, 2019, following feminist demonstrations against gender-based violence and feminicides, the monument was affected due to acts of vandalism and graffiti. The Government of Mexico City closed access for an indefinite period; but it is estimated that it could be between one and two years. \nHowever, the capital government declared justifying that the closure is due to the restoration, within the framework of a work program in Paseo de la Reforma that involves several more monuments.\n\n==Mausoleum==\n[[File:Monumento a la Independencia, M\u00e9xico D.F., M\u00e9xico, 2014-10-13, DD 24.JPG|thumbnail|The monument lit at night with color changing LED light.]]\n[[Image:Angel de la Independencia Mexico City.jpg|right|thumb|The Independence Angel on the [[Paseo de la Reforma]], at sunset.]]\n\nIn 1925, during the administration of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]], the remains of the following Heroes of the Mexican Independence were interred in a [[mausoleum]] under the base of the monument. At the entry to the mausoleum is a statue of [[William Lamport]], also known as Don Guill\u00e9n de Lampart y Guzm\u00e1n, an Irishman who was tried by the [[Mexican Inquisition]] in the mid seventeenth century,  following the discovery of his plot to achieve the independence of [[New Spain]].

While entry is free, visitors must obtain a permit at the Cuauht\u00e9moc borough by showing an ID.  Groups of no more than six people are permitted  inside the monument for about 15 minutes. With about 200 steps, the climb is arduous. The first approximately 15 stairs, located in the monument the base, are wide and comfortable. The stairs in the column itself, approximately 185, are circular, metal, very narrow and without a landing or resting point until the top. Visitors who are not in good physical shape will find the climb exhausting\u2014it is the equivalent of climbing a 14-story building in one go, and those not comfortable in tight spaces should avoid the climb as it has insufficient room to allow others to bypass. Some staircase areas are very dark, with only a few slits to let in light. The top balcony, though narrow, offers a commanding view of the wide avenues that surround the column. The return trip down is by way of the same circular staircase.\n\nMore recently ''El \u00c1ngel'' has become the traditional gathering place for celebration by Mexico City inhabitants, particularly following [[Mexico national football team]]  victories and as a focal point for political rallies.\n\nAs of March 2016, visiting inside is limited to Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Angel of Peace]]'', [[Prinzregentenstrasse]], Munich\n*''[[La Victoria del Viento]]''\n*[[Mexican War of Independence]]\n*[[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]\n*[[Porfiriato]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |author1=Baird, David |author2=Bairstow, Lynne |title=Frommer's Mexico 2005 |publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc |year=2004 |isbn=0764567632 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/frommersmexico2000bair }}\n*Legorreta, Jorge (Sep. 18, 2002).

While entry is free, visitors must obtain a permit at the Cuauht\u00e9moc borough by showing an ID.  Groups of no more than six people are permitted  inside the monument for about 15 minutes. With about 200 steps, the climb is arduous. The first approximately 15 stairs, located in the monument the base, are wide and comfortable. The stairs in the column itself, approximately 185, are circular, metal, very narrow and without a landing or resting point until the top. Visitors who are not in good physical shape will find the climb exhausting\u2014it is the equivalent of climbing a 14-story building in one go, and those not comfortable in tight spaces should avoid the climb as it has insufficient room to allow others to bypass. Some staircase areas are very dark, with only a few slits to let in light. The top balcony, though narrow, offers a commanding view of the wide avenues that surround the column. The return trip down is by way of the same circular staircase.\n\nMore recently ''El \u00c1ngel'' has become the traditional gathering place for celebration by Mexico City inhabitants, particularly following [[Mexico national football team]]  victories and as a focal point for political rallies.\n\nAs of March 2016, visiting inside is limited to Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Angel of Peace]]'', [[Prinzregentenstrasse]], Munich\n*''[[La Victoria del Viento]]''\n*[[Mexican War of Independence]]\n*[[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]\n*[[Porfiriato]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |author1=Baird, David |author2=Bairstow, Lynne |title=Frommer's Mexico 2005 |publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc |year=2004 |isbn=0764567632 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/frommersmexico2000bair }}\n*Legorreta, Jorge (Sep. 18, 2002).
