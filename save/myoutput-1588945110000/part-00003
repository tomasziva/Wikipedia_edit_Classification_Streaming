He was an extreme radical leader of the [[French Revolution]], and one of the many followers of [[Jacques-Ren\u00e9 H\u00e9bert]], known as the ''[[H\u00e9bertists]].''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f5JfQgAACAAJ&dq=The%20Oxford%20History%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution&source=gbs_book_other_versions ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'']; William Doyle; Clarendon Press, 1989; p.252. |\"The Revolutionary Army was at last set on foot, and command of it went... to Ronsin, one of the fiercest allies of H\u00e9bert.\"</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBorn in 1751 in [[Soissons]], [[Aisne]], a city northeast of [[Paris]], Ronsin was son of a master cooper or barrel maker. At the age of seventeen, Charles-Philippe Ronsin joined the Parisian army. By 1772 he left the army with the position of corporal and soon became a playwright and a tutor. In these years he met the artist [[Jacques-Louis David]] and they became good friends.\n\nWelcoming the Revolution, Ronsin became the [[bourgeois]] Guard Captain in the district of Saint-Roch in 1789. He presented several patriotic pieces in some of the theatres in the capital between the years 1790 and 1792. It was in this period that Ronsin became a club orator and joined the club of the [[Cordeliers]].\n\n== Influences ==\nIn August and September 1792, the Executive Council entrusted him three missions. In November, the minister of war, Pache, named him commissioner-organizer in Belgium to the army of [[Dumouriez]]. In this post, Ronsin denounced the acts of violence of the suppliers to the armed forces, who were protected by the general.\n\nRonsin was named assistant of the minister of war of Bouchotte on 23 April 1793, without ever commanding a squadron. It is possible that Ronsin received that position thanks to his friendship with [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette|Chaumette]] and [[Jacques H\u00e9bert|H\u00e9bert]]. In May, he left to [[Vend\u00e9e]], to help the provisioning armies. There was an incident in which Ronsin was upset that his plan for defeating the [[Vendeans]] was rejected, therefore, he decided to make sure that [[Jean Baptiste Camille Canclaux|General Canclaux]] was defeated by the Vendeans, ensuring his own victory. He led his troops to [[Vihiers]] and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Beaulieu (Saumur)|Beaulieu]] and was eventually trapped at [[Coron, Maine-et-Loire|Coron]]. Because of Ronsin's decision the [[Vendeans]] took over Beaulieu and managed to convince the Committee to get rid of Canclaux.\n\nRonsin's support among the [[Cordeliers]] and the ministry allowed him to cross the rank of captain to that of brigadier general in the army of the coasts of Rochelle. In September, 1793, he becomes chief general of the revolutionary army of Paris. Ronsin had a violent character and was very outspoken. He, however, proved to be a good leader. Ronsin was witty and clever when dealing with his different functions. However, thanks to his quick ascent and his character Ronsin acquired numerous enemies, particularly [[Pierre Philippeaux]] and [[Fabre d'Eglantine]].\n\nRonsin created a bill that was posted in Paris after his return from Lyon that stated that there were one hundred and forty thousand people living in Lyon, fifteen hundred of which had nothing to do with the rebellions. Ronsin stated that before the end of September, all of the people who were guilty would die. On 27 September [[Fabre d'Eglantine]] denounced Ronsin for being an ultra-revolutionist. Ronsin was arrested along with [[Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Vincent]], who was another member of the [[Cordeliers]] Club.\n\n==Last days==\nWhile in prison the [[Cordeliers]] wrote a petition in favor of both [[Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Vincent|Vincent]] and Ronsin, stating that they were great patriots and that Ronsin should not be punished for attacking [[Dumouriez]], [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Custine]], and [[Brissot]]. Among those who were defending Ronsin was [[Collot d'Herbois]], who was also part of the Committee. Collot d'Herbois defended Ronsin, saying that while fighting in the South along with all of the other patriots of the Revolution, Ronsin showed great determination in enforcing respect for the republic.\n\nWith the help of [[Fouquier-Tinville]], Ronsin was believed to be working on a military conspiracy to replace the revolutionary government with a military dictatorship. [[Fouquier-Tinville]] called him one of the \"new Cromwell\".\n\nRonsin was finally arrested along with [[Jacques H\u00e9bert|H\u00e9bert]], [[Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Momoro|Momoro]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Vincent|Vincent]]. While in prison Ronsin is quoted with saying these words to his co-accused: \"...you will be condemned. When you should have acted, you talked. Know how to die. For my part, I swear that you shall not see me flinch. Strive to do the same.\"\nSome of his final words before his death were, \"Liberty undone!...because a few paltry fellows are about to perish! Liberty is immortal.
