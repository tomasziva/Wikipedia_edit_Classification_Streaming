Full-time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the \"data center\" model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM's mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.\n\nIn the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering [[virtual private network]] (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost.

The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.&nbsp;\n\n''Rapid elasticity.'' Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\n\n''Measured service.'' Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).

Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single [[Linux kernel]] running directly on the physical hardware. Linux [[cgroups]] and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead.

Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, [[Eugene Schultz]], chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. \"There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into\". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack\u2014a process he called \"hyperjacking\".

A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\n\n''Broad network access.'' Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, [[laptop]]s, and workstations).\n\n''[[Pooling (resource management)|Resource pooling]].'' The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.&nbsp;\n\n''Rapid elasticity.'' Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\n\n''Measured service.'' Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).

It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems.

It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information.<ref name=\"ryan\">{{cite web|url= http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103200-cloud-computing-privacy-concerns-on-our-doorstep/fulltext |title= Cloud Computing Privacy Concerns on Our Doorstep }}</ref> Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users' choices for how data is stored.<ref name=\"ryan\"/> Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.<ref name=\"cloudid\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025|title = CloudID: Trustworthy cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification| journal=Expert Systems with Applications| volume=42| issue=21| pages=7905\u20137916|year = 2015|last1 = Haghighat|first1 = Mohammad| last2=Zonouz| first2=Saman| last3=Abdel-Mottaleb| first3=Mohamed}}</ref><ref name=\"ryan\"/> [[Identity management systems]] can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing. These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities.\n\nAccording to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are ''Insecure Interfaces and APIs'', ''Data Loss & Leakage'', and ''Hardware Failure''\u2014which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, [[Eugene Schultz]], chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. \"There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into\". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack\u2014a process he called \"hyperjacking\". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.<ref name=\"psg.hitachi-solutions.com\">{{Cite web|title = Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and iCloud Reach the Top 5 Cloud Storage Security Breaches List|url = https://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/credeon/blog/google-drive-dropbox-box-and-icloud-reach-the-top-5-cloud-storage-security-breaches-list|website = psg.hitachi-solutions.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151123032912/https://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/credeon/blog/google-drive-dropbox-box-and-icloud-reach-the-top-5-cloud-storage-security-breaches-list|archive-date = 2015-11-23|url-status=dead|df = }}</ref> Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).<ref name=\"psg.hitachi-solutions.com\"/>\n\nThere is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/26/business/la-fi-tech-savvy-cloud-services-20120426 |title=Who owns your stuff in the cloud? |date=26 April 2012 |first=Michelle |last=Maltais |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off-site and under someone else's control (public cloud).

There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes don't read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click \"Accept\" without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work, for example for an [[intelligent personal assistant]] (Apple's [[Siri]] or [[Google Now]]). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Bumpy Road to Private Clouds| url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2549867/data-center/the-bumpy-road-to-private-clouds.html |access-date=8 October 2014| date=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Limitations and disadvantages==\nAccording to [[Bruce Schneier]], \"The downside is that you will have limited customization options. Cloud computing is cheaper because of [[Economies of scale|economics of scale]], and\u2014like any outsourced task\u2014you tend to get what you want. A restaurant with a limited menu is cheaper than a personal chef who can cook anything you want. Fewer options at a much cheaper price: it's a feature, not a bug.\" He also suggests that \"the cloud provider might not meet your legal needs\" and that businesses need to weigh the benefits of cloud computing against the risks.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/should_companie.html\n| title = Should Companies Do Most of Their Computing in the Cloud?

Nevertheless, cloud computing has proven to have some limitations and disadvantages, especially for smaller business operations, particularly regarding security and downtime. Technical outages are inevitable and occur sometimes when cloud service providers (CSPs) become overwhelmed in the process of serving their clients. This may result in temporary business suspension. Since this technology's systems rely on the Internet, an individual cannot access their applications, server or data from the cloud during an outage.\n\n==Emerging trends==\nCloud computing is still a subject of research.<ref name=ghc>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=David Mitchell|title=Hype Cycle for Cloud Computing, 2013|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2573318/hype-cycle-cloud-computing-|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref> A driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been [[chief technology officer]]s seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware in-house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hello-cirro.co.uk/evolution-of-cloud-computing/|title=The evolution of Cloud Computing|accessdate=22 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329121024/http://www.hello-cirro.co.uk/evolution-of-cloud-computing/|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud [[Research and Development]].
