Traditionally the Berber element of the army had the strongest sway over political affairs, but as the Turkish element grew more powerful, it began to challenge this, and by 1020 serious riots had begun to break out among the Black African troops who were fighting back against a [[Berber people|Berber]]-Turk Alliance.\n\nBy the 1060s, the tentative balance between the different ethnic groups within the Fatimid army collapsed as Egypt suffered an extended period of drought and famine. Declining resources accelerated the problems among the different ethnic factions, and outright civil war began, primarily between the Turks under [[Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan]] and Black African troops, while the Berbers shifted alliance between the two sides.<ref>Cambridge history of Egypt vol 1 page 155</ref> The [[Turkish people|Turkish]] forces of the Fatimid army seized most of [[Cairo]] and held the city and [[Caliph]] at ransom, while the Berber troops and remaining [[Sudan]]ese forces roamed the other parts of Egypt.\n\nBy 1072, in a desperate attempt to save Egypt, the Fatimid Caliph Ab\u016b Tam\u012bm [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] recalled general [[Badr al-Jamali]], who was at the time the governor of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. [[Badr al-Jamali]] led his troops into Egypt and was able to successfully suppress the different groups of the rebelling armies, largely purging the Turks in the process. Although the Caliphate was saved from immediate destruction, the decade long rebellion devastated Egypt and it was never able to regain much power. As a result, Badr al-Jamali was also made the [[vizier]] of the Fatimid caliph, becoming one of the first military viziers (\"Amir al Juyush\", {{lang-ar|\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0634}}, Commander of Forces of the Fatimids) who would dominate late Fatimid politics.

Badr al-Jamali's son, [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]], succeeded him in power as vizier.\n\nIn the 1040s, the Berber [[Zirids]] (governors of North Africa under the Fatimids) declared their independence from the Fatimids and their recognition of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad, which led the Fatimids to launch the devastating [[Banu Hilal|Ban\u016b Hilal]] invasions of North Africa. After about 1070, the Fatimid hold on the [[Levant]] coast and parts of Syria was challenged first by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] invasions, then the [[First Crusade|Crusades]], so that Fatimid territory shrank until it consisted only of Egypt. The Fatimids gradually lost the [[Emirate of Sicily]] [[Emirate of sicily#Decline|over thirty years]] to the [[Italo-Norman]] [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] who was in total control of the entire island by 1091.\n\nThe reliance on the [[Iqta]] system also ate into Fatimid central authority, as more and more the military officers at the further ends of the empire became semi-independent.\n\nAfter the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s, the [[Zengid]] ruler [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|N\u016br ad-D\u012bn]] had his general, [[Shirkuh]], seize Egypt from the vizier [[Shawar]] in 1169.

The caliph had been residing in nearby Raqqada but chose this new and more strategic location in which to establish his dynasty. The city of al-Mahdiyya is located on a narrow peninsula along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, east of [[Kairouan]] and just south of the Gulf of Hammamet, in modern-day Tunisia. The primary concern in the city's construction and locale was defense. With its peninsular topography and the construction of a wall 8.3 m thick, the city became impenetrable by land. This strategic location, together with a navy that the Fatimids had inherited from the conquered Aghlabids, made the city of Al-Mahdiyya a strong military base where \u02bfAbdull\u0101h al-Mahd\u012b consolidated power and planted the seeds of the Fatimid caliphate for two generations. The city included two royal palaces \u2013 one for the caliph and one for his son and successor al-Q\u0101\u02beim \u2013 as well as a mosque, many administrative buildings, and an arsenal.<ref>Talbi, M., \"al-Mahdiyya\", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Second Edition, edited by: P.

Consulted online on 24 April 2017</ref>\n\nAl-Man\u1e63\u016briyya was established between 334 and 336 AH (945 and 948 CE) by the third Fatimid caliph al-Man\u1e63\u016br (334-41 AH/946-53 CE) in a settlement known as \u1e62abra, located on the outskirts of Kairouan in modern-day Tunisia. The new capital was established in commemoration of the victory of al-Man\u1e63\u016br over the Kh\u0101rijite rebel Ab\u016b Yaz\u012bd at \u1e62abra. Like Baghdad, the plan of the city of Al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya is round, with the caliphal palace at its center. Due to a plentiful water source, the city grew and expanded a great deal under al-Man\u1e63\u016br. Recent archaeological evidence suggests that there were more than 300 \u1e25amm\u0101ms built during this period in the city as well as numerous palaces. When al-Man\u1e63\u016br's successor, al-Mu\u02bfizz, moved the caliphate to Cairo, his deputy stayed behind as regent of al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya and usurped power for himself, marking the end of the Fatimid reign in al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya and the beginning of the city's ruin (spurred on by a violent revolt). The city remained downtrodden and more or less uninhabited for centuries afterward.<ref>Talbi, M., \"\u1e62abra or al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P.

Cairo can thus be considered the capital of Fatimid cultural production. Though the original [[Fatimid Great Palaces|Fatimid palace complex]], including administrative buildings and royal residents, no longer exists, modern scholars can glean a good idea of the original structure based on the Mamluk-era account of al-Maqr\u012bz\u012b. Perhaps the most important of Fatimid monuments outside the palace complex is the mosque of al-Azhar (359-61 AH/970-72 CE) which still stands today, though little of the building is original to its first Fatimid construction. Likewise the important Fatimid mosque of al-\u1e24\u0101kim, built from 380-403 AH/990-1012 CE under two Fatimid caliphs, has been rebuilt under subsequent dynasties. Cairo remained the capital for, including al-Mu\u02bfizz, eleven generations of caliphs, after which the Fatimid Caliphate finally fell to Ayyubid forces in 567 AH/1171 CE.<ref>Rogers, J.M., J. M.

Fatimid dynasty, found in Fustat, Egypt. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nUnlike western European governments in the era, advancement in Fatimid state offices was more [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] than based on heredity. Members of other branches of Islam, like the [[Sunni]]s, were just as likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance was extended to non-Muslims such as [[Christians]] and [[Jews]],<ref name=\"gold84\" /> who occupied high levels in government based on ability, and tolerance was set into place to ensure the flow of money from all those who were non-Muslims in order to finance the Caliphs' large army of [[Mamluks]] brought in from Circassia by Genoese merchants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} There were exceptions to this general attitude of tolerance, however, most notably by [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], though this has been highly debated, with Al-Hakim's reputation among medieval Muslim historians conflated with his role in the [[Druze|Druze faith]].<ref name=\"gold84\" />\n\nThe Fatimids were also known for their exquisite arts. A type of ceramic, [[lustreware]], was prevalent during the Fatimid period. Glassware and metalworking was also popular. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today; the most defining examples include the [[Al-Azhar University]] and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]]. The madrasa is one of the relics of the Fatimid dynasty era of Egypt, descended from [[Fatimah]], daughter of [[Muhammad]]. Fatimah was called ''Az-Zahra'' (the brilliant), and the madrasa was named in her honour.<ref>Halm, Heinz. The [[Fatimids]] and their Traditions of Learning.

(and of succeeding dynasties as well).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nA fundamental change occurred when the Fatimid Caliph attempted to push into Syria in the latter half of the 10th century.  The Fatimids were faced with the now Turkish-dominated forces of the Abbasid Caliph and began to realize the limits of their current military. Thus during the reign of [[Abu Mansur Nizar al-Aziz Billah]] and [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], the Caliph began incorporating armies of [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and later black Africans (even later, other groups such as Armenians were also used).<ref>Cambridge History of Egypt, Vol. 1, pg. 155.</ref> The army units were generally separated along ethnic lines, thus the Berbers were usually the light cavalry and foot skirmishers, while the Turks were the [[horse archers]] or [[heavy cavalry]] (known as ''[[Mamluks]]'').  The black Africans, Syrians, and Arabs generally acted as the [[heavy infantry]] and foot [[archer]]s. This ethnic-based army system, along with the partial slave status of many of the imported ethnic fighters, would remain fundamentally unchanged in Egypt for many centuries after the fall of the Fatimid Caliph.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe Fatimids focused their military toward the defence of the empire whenever it was menaced by dangers and threats, which they were able to repel. During his reign, the [[Byzantine Empire]] was ruled by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]], who had destroyed the Muslim [[Emirate of Crete|Emirate of Chandax]] in 961 and conquered Tartus, Al-Masaisah, 'Ain Zarbah, among other areas, gaining complete control of Iraq and the Syrian borders as well as earning the sobriquet, the \"Pale Death of the Saracens\". With the Fatimids, however, he proved less successful. After renouncing his payments of tribute to the Fatimid caliphs, he sent an expedition to [[Sicily]], but was forced by defeats on land and sea to evacuate the island completely. In 967, he made peace with the Fatimids and turned to defend himself against their common enemy, [[Otto&nbsp;I]], who had proclaimed himself Roman Emperor and had attacked Byzantine possessions in Italy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter [[Al-Mustansir Billah]], his sons [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] and [[Al-Musta'li]] both claimed the right to rule, leading to a split into the [[Nizari]] and [[Musta'li]] factions respectively. Nizar's successors eventually came to be known as the ''[[Aga Khan]]''. While [[Musta'li]]'s followers eventually came to be called as the ''[[Dawoodi bohra]]''\n\nThe Fatimid dynasty continued under Al-Musta'li until [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]]'s death in 1132. Leadership was then contested between [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim]], Al-Amir's two-year-old son, and [[Al-Hafiz]], Al-Amir's cousin whose supporters ([[Hafizi]]) claimed Al-Amir died without an heir. The supporters of At-Tayyib became the [[Tayyibi]] Isma'ilis. At-Tayyib's claim to the imamate was endorsed by [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]], Queen of Yemen. In 1084, Al-Mustansir had designated Arwa designated a ''hujjah'' (a holy, pious lady), the highest rank in the Yemeni [[Da'wah]]. Under Arwa, the ''Da'i al-Balagh'' (the imam's local representative) Lamak ibn Malik and then Yahya ibn Lamak worked for the cause of the Fatimids. After At-Tayyib's disappearance, Arwa named [[Dhu'ayb bin Musa]] the first ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]'' with full authority over Tayyibi religious matters. Tayyibi Isma'ili missionaries (in about 1067 AD(460AH)) spread their religion to India,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Tribes and Castes of Bombay |volume=1 |first=R.

Traditionally the Berber element of the army had the strongest sway over political affairs, but as the Turkish element grew more powerful, it began to challenge this, and by 1020 serious riots had begun to break out among the Black African troops who were fighting back against a [[Berber people|Berber]]-Turk Alliance.\n\nBy the 1060s, the tentative balance between the different ethnic groups within the Fatimid army collapsed as Egypt suffered an extended period of drought and famine. Declining resources accelerated the problems among the different ethnic factions, and outright civil war began, primarily between the Turks under [[Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan]] and Black African troops, while the Berbers shifted alliance between the two sides.<ref>Cambridge history of Egypt vol 1 page 155</ref> The [[Turkish people|Turkish]] forces of the Fatimid army seized most of [[Cairo]] and held the city and [[Caliph]] at ransom, while the Berber troops and remaining [[Sudan]]ese forces roamed the other parts of Egypt.\n\nBy 1072, in a desperate attempt to save Egypt, the Fatimid Caliph Ab\u016b Tam\u012bm [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] recalled general [[Badr al-Jamali]], who was at the time the governor of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. [[Badr al-Jamali]] led his troops into Egypt and was able to successfully suppress the different groups of the rebelling armies, largely purging the Turks in the process. Although the Caliphate was saved from immediate destruction, the decade long rebellion devastated Egypt and it was never able to regain much power. As a result, Badr al-Jamali was also made the [[vizier]] of the Fatimid caliph, becoming one of the first military viziers (\"Amir al Juyush\", {{lang-ar|\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0634}}, Commander of Forces of the Fatimids) who would dominate late Fatimid politics.

After about 1070, the Fatimid hold on the [[Levant]] coast and parts of Syria was challenged first by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] invasions, then the [[First Crusade|Crusades]], so that Fatimid territory shrank until it consisted only of Egypt.

The caliph had been residing in nearby Raqqada but chose this new and more strategic location in which to establish his dynasty. The city of al-Mahdiyya is located on a narrow peninsula along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, east of [[Kairouan]] and just south of the Gulf of Hammamet, in modern-day Tunisia. The primary concern in the city's construction and locale was defense. With its peninsular topography and the construction of a wall 8.3 m thick, the city became impenetrable by land. This strategic location, together with a navy that the Fatimids had inherited from the conquered Aghlabids, made the city of Al-Mahdiyya a strong military base where \u02bfAbdull\u0101h al-Mahd\u012b consolidated power and planted the seeds of the Fatimid caliphate for two generations. The city included two royal palaces \u2013 one for the caliph and one for his son and successor al-Q\u0101\u02beim \u2013 as well as a mosque, many administrative buildings, and an arsenal.<ref>Talbi, M., \"al-Mahdiyya\", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Second Edition, edited by: P.

Consulted online on 24 April 2017</ref>\n\nAl-Man\u1e63\u016briyya was established between 334 and 336 AH (945 and 948 CE) by the third Fatimid caliph al-Man\u1e63\u016br (334-41 AH/946-53 CE) in a settlement known as \u1e62abra, located on the outskirts of Kairouan in modern-day Tunisia. The new capital was established in commemoration of the victory of al-Man\u1e63\u016br over the Kh\u0101rijite rebel Ab\u016b Yaz\u012bd at \u1e62abra. Like Baghdad, the plan of the city of Al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya is round, with the caliphal palace at its center. Due to a plentiful water source, the city grew and expanded a great deal under al-Man\u1e63\u016br. Recent archaeological evidence suggests that there were more than 300 \u1e25amm\u0101ms built during this period in the city as well as numerous palaces. When al-Man\u1e63\u016br's successor, al-Mu\u02bfizz, moved the caliphate to Cairo, his deputy stayed behind as regent of al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya and usurped power for himself, marking the end of the Fatimid reign in al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya and the beginning of the city's ruin (spurred on by a violent revolt). The city remained downtrodden and more or less uninhabited for centuries afterward.<ref>Talbi, M., \"\u1e62abra or al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P.

Cairo can thus be considered the capital of Fatimid cultural production. Though the original [[Fatimid Great Palaces|Fatimid palace complex]], including administrative buildings and royal residents, no longer exists, modern scholars can glean a good idea of the original structure based on the Mamluk-era account of al-Maqr\u012bz\u012b. Perhaps the most important of Fatimid monuments outside the palace complex is the mosque of al-Azhar (359-61/970-2) which still stands today, though little of the building is original to its first Fatimid construction. Likewise the important Fatimid mosque of al-\u1e24\u0101kim, built from 380-403 AH/990-1012 CE under two Fatimid caliphs, has been rebuilt under subsequent dynasties. Cairo remained the capital for, including al-Mu\u02bfizz, eleven generations of caliphs, after which the Fatimid Caliphate finally fell to Ayyubid forces in 567 AH/1171 CE.<ref>Rogers, J.M., J. M.

Fatimid dynasty, found in Fustat, Egypt. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nUnlike western European governments in the era, advancement in Fatimid state offices was more [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] than based on heredity. Members of other branches of Islam, like the [[Sunni]]s, were just as likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance was extended to non-Muslims such as [[Christians]] and [[Jews]],<ref name=\"gold84\" /> who occupied high levels in government based on ability, and tolerance was set into place to ensure the flow of money from all those who were non-Muslims in order to finance the Caliphs' large army of [[Mamluks]] brought in from Circassia by Genoese merchants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} There were exceptions to this general attitude of tolerance, however, most notably by [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], though this has been highly debated, with Al-Hakim's reputation among medieval Muslim historians conflated with his role in the [[Druze|Druze faith]].<ref name=\"gold84\" />\n\nThe Fatimids were also known for their exquisite arts. A type of ceramic, [[lustreware]], was prevalent during the Fatimid period. Glassware and metalworking was also popular. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today; the most defining examples include the [[Al-Azhar University]] and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]]. The madrasa is one of the relics of the Fatimid dynasty era of Egypt, descended from [[Fatimah]], daughter of [[Muhammad]]. Fatimah was called ''Az-Zahra'' (the brilliant), and the madrasa was named in her honour.<ref>Halm, Heinz. The [[Fatimids]] and their Traditions of Learning.

(and of succeeding dynasties as well).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nA fundamental change occurred when the Fatimid Caliph attempted to push into Syria in the latter half of the 10th century.  The Fatimids were faced with the now Turkish-dominated forces of the Abbasid Caliph and began to realize the limits of their current military. Thus during the reign of [[Abu Mansur Nizar al-Aziz Billah]] and [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], the Caliph began incorporating armies of [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and later black Africans (even later, other groups such as Armenians were also used).<ref>Cambridge History of Egypt, Vol. 1, pg. 155.</ref> The army units were generally separated along ethnic lines, thus the Berbers were usually the light cavalry and foot skirmishers, while the Turks were the [[horse archers]] or [[heavy cavalry]] (known as ''[[Mamluks]]'').  The black Africans, Syrians, and Arabs generally acted as the [[heavy infantry]] and foot [[archer]]s. This ethnic-based army system, along with the partial slave status of many of the imported ethnic fighters, would remain fundamentally unchanged in Egypt for many centuries after the fall of the Fatimid Caliph.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe Fatimids focused their military toward the defence of the empire whenever it was menaced by dangers and threats, which they were able to repel. During his reign, the [[Byzantine Empire]] was ruled by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]], who had destroyed the Muslim [[Emirate of Crete|Emirate of Chandax]] in 961 and conquered Tartus, Al-Masaisah, 'Ain Zarbah, among other areas, gaining complete control of Iraq and the Syrian borders as well as earning the sobriquet, the \"Pale Death of the Saracens\". With the Fatimids, however, he proved less successful. After renouncing his payments of tribute to the Fatimid caliphs, he sent an expedition to [[Sicily]], but was forced by defeats on land and sea to evacuate the island completely. In 967, he made peace with the Fatimids and turned to defend himself against their common enemy, [[Otto&nbsp;I]], who had proclaimed himself Roman Emperor and had attacked Byzantine possessions in Italy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter [[Al-Mustansir Billah]], his sons [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] and [[Al-Musta'li]] both claimed the right to rule, leading to a split into the [[Nizari]] and [[Musta'li]] factions respectively. Nizar's successors eventually came to be known as the ''[[Aga Khan]]''. While [[Musta'li]]'s followers eventually came to be called as the ''[[Dawoodi bohra]]''\n\nThe Fatimid dynasty continued under Al-Musta'li until [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]]'s death in 1132. Leadership was then contested between [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim]], Al-Amir's two-year-old son, and [[Al-Hafiz]], Al-Amir's cousin whose supporters ([[Hafizi]]) claimed Al-Amir died without an heir. The supporters of At-Tayyib became the [[Tayyibi]] Isma'ilis. At-Tayyib's claim to the imamate was endorsed by [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]], Queen of Yemen. In 1084, Al-Mustansir had designated Arwa designated a ''hujjah'' (a holy, pious lady), the highest rank in the Yemeni [[Da'wah]]. Under Arwa, the ''Da'i al-Balagh'' (the imam's local representative) Lamak ibn Malik and then Yahya ibn Lamak worked for the cause of the Fatimids. After At-Tayyib's disappearance, Arwa named [[Dhu'ayb bin Musa]] the first ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]'' with full authority over Tayyibi religious matters. Tayyibi Isma'ili missionaries (in about 1067 AD(460AH)) spread their religion to India,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Tribes and Castes of Bombay |volume=1 |first=R.
