Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of [[Panagiotis Kavvadias]] of 1885\u201390. The findings of this dig allowed [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]], then director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by D\u00f6rpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.<ref>W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Der aeltere Parthenon\", ''Ath. Mitteilungen'', XVII, 1892, pp. 158\u2013189 and W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Die Zeit des alteren Parthenon\", ''AM'' '''27''', 1902, 379\u2013416</ref> D\u00f6rpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885\u201390 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.<ref>P.

However, the excavations of [[Bert Hodge Hill]] led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of [[Cimon|Kimon]] after 468&nbsp;BC.<ref>B.H. Hill, \"The Older Parthenon\", ''AJA', XVI, 1912, 535\u201358</ref> Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\u00f6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at {{convert|23.51|x|66.888|m|2|lk=on}}.\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925\u201333.<ref>B. Graef, E.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]] \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist [[Phidias]], who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [[Ictinos]] and [[Callicrates]] began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432. However, work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\n[[File:Parthenon restoration.gif|thumb|Parthenon animation showing the building in the past and in present day]]\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools -- picks, points, punches, chisels and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who traveled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a very specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel around and work where they were needed.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nOther craftsmen also were necessary in the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled laborers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. These laborers loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, a number of different laborers were needed, and each played a critical role in constructing the final building.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Parthenon plan.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]\n\nThe Parthenon is a [[peripteral]] [[octastyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] architectural features. It stands on a platform or [[stylobate]] of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [[post and lintel]] construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [[entablature]]. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and 17 on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the ''[[cella]],'' which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the [[gable]] is finished with a triangular [[pediment]] originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the [[Doric order]], with simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [[frieze]] of carved pictorial panels ([[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]), separated by formal architectural [[triglyph]]s, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured [[frieze]] in low relief. This element of the architecture is [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in style rather than Doric.<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''History of architecture on the Comparative Method'', pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are {{convert|69.5|by|30.9|m|ft}}. The cella was 29.8&nbsp;meters long by 19.2&nbsp;meters wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} in diameter and are {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the [[wikt:concave|concave]] shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [[imbrex and tegula|imbrices and tegulae]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Architect and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdMAAAAYAAJ|year=1892|publisher=American Architect}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tegula.html|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Architecture \u2014 Roof Tiles (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote [[John Julius Cooper]], \"Enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns.\"<ref>John Julius Norwich, ''Great Architecture of the World'', 2001, p. 63</ref><!-- If we must have this quote let's at least get it right. --> ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the slight swelling, of {{convert|4|cm}}, in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,<ref>And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, ''Principles of Athenian Architecture'' 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9).</ref> it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes.

Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.<ref>Penrose ''op. cit.'' pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''66'''.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).</ref>\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"<ref>Archeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory.

In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.<ref name=SmithMag>{{Citation|last=Hadingham|first=Evan|year=February 2008|title=Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|location= Washington, DC|page=42}}</ref>\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its fa\u00e7ade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [[golden ratio]].<ref>Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.</ref> However, such theories have been discredited by more recent studies, which have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Markowsky|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|title=Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 1992|access-date=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408200850/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C|origyear=2002|edition=First trade paperback|year=2003|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|pages=74\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:British Museum (8375482047).jpg|thumb|Group from the east pediment, [[British Museum]].]]\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the [[Athena Parthenos|chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos]] sculpted by [[Phidias]] and dedicated in 439 or 438&nbsp;BC.

The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian [[Centauromachy]] (battle of the [[Lapiths]] aided by [[Theseus]] against the half-man, half-horse [[Centaur]]s).

The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory.

Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of [[Panagiotis Kavvadias]] of 1885\u201390. The findings of this dig allowed [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]], then director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by D\u00f6rpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.<ref>W.

This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885\u201390 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.<ref>P.

However, the excavations of [[Bert Hodge Hill]] led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of [[Cimon|Kimon]] after 468&nbsp;BC.<ref>B.H. Hill, \"The Older Parthenon\", ''AJA', XVI, 1912, 535\u201358</ref> Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\u00f6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at {{convert|23.51|x|66.888|m|2|lk=on}}.\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925\u201333.<ref>B. Graef, E. Langlotz, ''Die Antiken Vasen von der Akropolis zu Athen'', Berlin 1925\u201333</ref> This inspired American archaeologist [[William Bell Dinsmoor]] to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495&nbsp;BC, contradicting the early date given by D\u00f6rpfeld.<ref>W. Dinsmoor, \"The Date of the Older Parthenon\", ''AJA'', XXXVIII, 1934, 408\u201348</ref> Further, Dinsmoor denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what D\u00f6rpfeld referred to as Parthenon II.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]] \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist [[Phidias]], who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [[Ictinos]] and [[Callicrates]] began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432. However, work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\n[[File:Parthenon restoration.gif|thumb|Parthenon animation showing the building in the past and in present day]]\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools -- picks, points, punches, chisels and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who traveled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a very specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel around and work where they were needed.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nOther craftsmen also were necessary in the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled laborers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. These laborers loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, a number of different laborers were needed, and each played a critical role in constructing the final building.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Parthenon plan.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]\n\nThe Parthenon is a [[peripteral]] [[octastyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] architectural features. It stands on a platform or [[stylobate]] of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [[post and lintel]] construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [[entablature]]. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and 17 on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the ''[[cella]],'' which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the [[gable]] is finished with a triangular [[pediment]] originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the [[Doric order]], with simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [[frieze]] of carved pictorial panels ([[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]), separated by formal architectural [[triglyph]]s, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured [[frieze]] in low relief. This element of the architecture is [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in style rather than Doric.<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''History of architecture on the Comparative Method'', pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are {{convert|69.5|by|30.9|m|ft}}. The cella was 29.8&nbsp;meters long by 19.2&nbsp;meters wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} in diameter and are {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column having 20 flutes. (A flute is the [[wikt:concave|concave]] shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [[imbrex and tegula|imbrices and tegulae]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Architect and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdMAAAAYAAJ|year=1892|publisher=American Architect}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tegula.html|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Architecture \u2014 Roof Tiles (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote [[John Julius Cooper]], \"Enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns.\"<ref>John Julius Norwich, ''Great Architecture of the World'', 2001, p. 63</ref><!-- If we must have this quote let's at least get it right. --> ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the slight swelling, of {{convert|4|cm}}, in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,<ref>And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, ''Principles of Athenian Architecture'' 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9).</ref> it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly {{convert|2400|m|mi}} above the center of the Parthenon<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.architecturerevived.com/how-greek-temples-correct-visual-distortion/ |title = How Greek Temples Correct Visual Distortion \u2013 Architecture Revived}}</ref>. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.<ref>Penrose ''op. cit.'' pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''66'''.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).</ref>\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"<ref>Archeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory.

In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.<ref name=SmithMag>{{Citation|last=Hadingham|first=Evan|year=February 2008|title=Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|location= Washington, DC|page=42}}</ref>\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its fa\u00e7ade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [[golden ratio]].<ref>Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.</ref> However, such theories have been discredited by more recent studies, which have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Markowsky|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|title=Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 1992|access-date=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408200850/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C|origyear=2002|edition=First trade paperback|year=2003|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|pages=74\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:British Museum (8375482047).jpg|thumb|Group from the east pediment, [[British Museum]].]]\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the [[Athena Parthenos|chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos]] sculpted by [[Phidias]] and dedicated in 439 or 438&nbsp;BC.

In the ''[[opisthodomos]]'' (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian League, of which Athens was the leading member.\n\nOnly a very small number of the sculptures remain ''in situ''; most of the surviving sculptures are today (controversially) in the [[British Museum]] in London (as with the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles]]) and the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens, with a few pieces in the [[Louvre]], [[National Museum of Denmark]], and museums in Rome, [[Vienna]], and [[Palermo]].<ref>For comprehensive drawings showing the location of each piece today, see: [https://www.academia.edu/2543561/The_Parthenon= \"The Parthenon\", in ''Strolling Through Athens''], City of Athens, 2004, pp. 112\u2013119.</ref>\n\n===Metopes===\n{{Main|Metopes of the Parthenon}}\n[[File:Parthenon XL.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the West metopes]]\n\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], 14 each on the east and west sides, 32 each on the north and south sides.

The metopes of the west end show the [[Amazonomachy]] (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the [[Amazons]]). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian [[Centauromachy]] (battle of the [[Lapiths]] aided by [[Theseus]] against the half-man, half-horse [[Centaur]]s).

The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic [[marble]] they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2011/03/04/archaeologists-discover-new-metopes-of-parthenon/Discovery|title=Discovery Reveals Ancient Greek Theaters Used Moveable Stages Over 2,000 Years Ago |website=greece.greekreporter.com}}</ref>\n\n\n===Frieze===\n{{Main|Parthenon Frieze}}\n[[File:1868 Lawrence Alma-Tadema - Phidias Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends.jpg|thumb|''[[Phidias]] Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends'', 1868 painting by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]\n\nThe most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic [[frieze]] running around the exterior of the cella walls. The [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] frieze was carved in situ and is dated to 442&nbsp;BC-438&nbsp;BC.\n\nOne interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaic procession]] from the [[Dipylon Gate]] in the [[Kerameikos]] to the [[Acropolis]]. In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners participated in honoring the goddess [[Athena]] by offering her sacrifices and a new [[peplos]] (a dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called {{Lang|grc-Latn|ergastines}}).

She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of [[King Erechtheus]], a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over [[Eumolpos]] and his Thracian army. The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory. This represents the very first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions was based.<ref>Connelly, ''Parthenon and Parthenoi'', 53\u201380.</ref><ref>Connelly, ''The Parthenon Enigma'', chapters 4, 5, and 7.</ref>\n\n===Pediments===\n{{Main|Pediments of the Parthenon}}\nThe traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], when he visited the Acropolis at the end of the 2nd century AD, only mentioned briefly the sculptures of the [[pediment]]s (gable ends) of the temple, reserving the majority of his description for the gold and ivory statue of the goddess inside.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias1B.html |title=Description of Greece |author=Pausanias |author-link=Pausanias (geographer) |translator-first=W.H.S. |translator-last=Jones |year=1918 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |at=Book 1, 24.5}}</ref>\n\n====East pediment====\n[[File:Partenon04.JPG|thumb|Part of the east pediment still found on the Parthenon (although part of it, like Dionysos, is a copy)]]\n\nThe figures on the corners of the pediment depict the passage of time over the course of a full day.

The columns brought down with them the enormous marble architraves, triglyphs and metopes.\"<ref name=\"Chatziaslani\" /> About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which showered marble fragments over nearby Turkish defenders<ref name=\"Tomkinson2\" /> and caused large fires that burned until the following day and consumed many homes.<ref name=\"Chatziaslani\" />\n\n[[File:MotarFragmentFromParthenon-BritishMuseum-August21-08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fragment of an exploded shell found on top of a wall in the Parthenon, thought to originate from the time of the Venetian siege]]Accounts written at the time conflict over whether this destruction was deliberate or accidental; one such account, written by the German officer Sobievolski, states that a Turkish deserter revealed to Morosini the use to which the Turks had put the Parthenon; expecting that the Venetians would not target a building of such historic importance. Morosini was said to have responded by directing his artillery to aim at the Parthenon.<ref name=\"Chatziaslani\" /><ref name=\"Tomkinson2\" /> Subsequently, Morosini sought to loot sculptures from the ruin and caused further damage in the process.

Amongst those early travellers and archaeologists were [[James Stuart (1713\u20131788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], who were commissioned by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] to survey the ruins of classical Athens. What they produced was the first measured drawings of the Parthenon published in 1787 in the second volume of ''Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated''. In 1801, the British Ambassador at [[Constantinople]], the [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]], obtained a questionable ''firman'' (edict) from the [[Sultan]], whose existence or legitimacy has not been proved to this day, to make casts and drawings of the antiquities on the Acropolis, to demolish recent buildings if this was necessary to view the antiquities, and to remove sculptures from them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Independent Greece===\nWhen independent Greece gained control of Athens in 1832, the visible section of the minaret was demolished; only its base and spiral staircase up to the level of the [[architrave]] remain intact.<ref>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = John | title = Handbook for travellers in Greece, Volume 2 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1884 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac4GAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA317 | page = 317}}</ref> Soon all the medieval and Ottoman buildings on the Acropolis were destroyed.

An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] remaining on the site, and architects assisted with [[computer model]]s to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the [[Acropolis Museum]]. A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081003065234/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/Athens2007/FP111.pdf \"The Surface Conservation Project\"] (pdf file). Once they had been conserved, the West Frieze blocks were moved to the museum, and copies cast in artificial stone were reinstalled in their places.</ref> Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron '''H''' pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion. Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not so coated, and corroded. Since the corrosion product (rust) is expansive, the expansion caused further damage by cracking the marble.<ref>{{cite magazine |title =Unlocking the Mysteries of the Parthenon |author=Hadingham, Evan |magazine=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/parthenon.html |accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right\n | headerimage=[[File:Dionysos pediment Parthenon BM.jpg|210px]]\n | video1 = [http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html Sculpture from the Parthenon's East Pediment], [[Smarthistory]]<ref name=\"smarth\">{{cite web | title =Sculpture from the Parthenon's East Pediment | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | accessdate =18 March 2013 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130304063318/http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | archive-date =4 March 2013 | url-status =dead | df =dmy-all }}</ref> }}\n* [[Palermo Fragment]]\n* [[Ancient Greek architecture]]\n* [[Ancient Greek temple]]\n* [[List of Ancient Greek temples]]\n* [[List of megalithic sites]]\n* [[National Monument of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]]\n* [[Walhalla temple]] [[Regensburg]] \u2013 Exterior modeled on the Parthenon, but interior is a hall of fame for distinguished Germans\n* [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] \u2013 Full-scale replica\n* [[Temple of Hephaestus]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Printed sources===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|title=Greek Religion|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-36281-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Connelly |first=Joan Breton|authorlink=Joan Breton Connelly|date=1 January 1996|title=Parthenon and Parthenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |doi=10.2307/506297 |jstor=506297 |pages=53\u201380|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed67/f6cacd1b7d89e8aa82ecf24ff665f295f922.pdf }}\n* {{cite book | last = Connelly | first = Joan Breton | title = The Parthenon Enigma: A New Understanding of the West's Most Iconic Building and the People who Made It | publisher = Random House | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-307-47659-3 | author-link = Joan Breton Connelly | url = https://archive.org/details/parthenonenigma0000conn | url-access = registration }}\n* {{cite book | last = D'Ooge | first = Martin Luther | title = The Acropolis of Athens | url = https://archive.org/details/acropolisofathen00dooguoft | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1909}}\n* {{cite book |last=Frazer |first= Sir James George|title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=The King of the Woods|isbn=978-0-19-283541-3}}\n* {{cite book | last = Freely | first = John | title = Strolling Through Athens: Fourteen Unforgettable Walks through Europe's Oldest City | publisher = Tauris Parke Paperbacks | year = 2004 | edition=2 |isbn = 978-1-85043-595-2}}\n* {{cite book | last = Hollis | first = Edward | title = The Secret Lives of Buildings: From the Ruins of the Parthenon to the Vegas Strip in Thirteen Stories | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-8050-8785-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/secretlivesofbui0000holl }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hurwit |first=Jeffrey M. |title=The Athenian Acropolis: History, Mythology, and Archeology from the Neolithic Era to the Present |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42834-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hurwit|first=Jeffrey M.|title=Periklean Athens and Its Legacy: Problems and Perspectives|year=2005|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70622-4|editor=Judith M.
