A new mammal from the Turonian\u2013Campanian (Upper Cretaceous) Galula Formation, southwestern Tanzania. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 64(1):65-84</ref>\n\n==Discovery and context==\n''Galulatherium'' was discovered in 2002<ref>Stevens et al., 2007, p. 167</ref> in the locality [[TZ-07]] in the [[Mbeya Region]] of southwestern Tanzania, which has also yielded remains of various other [[vertebrate]]s, including birds and other [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs. The discovery was reported in a 2003 paper by David Krause and colleagues. TZ-07 lies in the \"[[Red Sandstone Unit]]\" (RSU), an informal, poorly defined rock unit. Age estimates for the RSU have ranged from [[middle Jurassic]] to [[Miocene]], but according to Krause and colleagues, part of this discrepancy is the result of confusion between two superficially similar rock units that outcrop nearby; the older one, where TZ-07 is located, is undoubtedly [[Mesozoic]] and the younger is [[Cenozoic]].<ref name=Kea322>Krause et al., 2003, p. 322</ref> Based on the presence of non-avian dinosaurs and [[osteoglossomorph]] fishes, Krause and colleagues assigned TZ-07 to the [[Cretaceous]] (146&ndash;66 million years ago).<ref name=Kea323>Krause et al., 2007, p. 323</ref> In 2007, Nancy Stevens and colleagues identified the unit that produced TNM&nbsp;02067 as likely belonging to the middle part of the Cretaceous (around [[Aptian]] to [[Cenomanian]]).<ref>Stevens et al., 2007, pp. 167&ndash;168</ref> TNM&nbsp;02067 is significant as one of the very few mammals from the Cretaceous of the southern continents ([[Gondwana]]).<ref>Krause et al., 2003, pp. 322&ndash;323</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Galulatherium photographs and drawings.jpg|thumb|Photographs and illustrations of TNM 02067 in lingual (A), labial (B), and occlusal (C) views. Scale bar=5&nbsp;mm]]\nTNM&nbsp;02067 is a damaged, partial left [[dentary]]  (lower jaw bone). It preserves much of the body of the bone, which is short and deep, but is broken along a vertical fracture behind the toothrow. There is another fracture in the front part of the jaw.<ref name=Kea323/> The bone is 19.5&nbsp;mm (0.77 in) long and 11.4&nbsp;mm (0.45 in) deep.<ref name=OCea282>O'Connor et al., 2006, p. 282</ref> All the teeth are incomplete or absent, and lack both [[tooth enamel|enamel]] and [[cementum]], but what remains indicates that there was a large [[incisor]] at the front and five cheekteeth further back, separated by a [[diastema (dentistry)|diastema]] (gap) of about 2.5&nbsp;mm (0.098 in). On the labial (outer) surface of the dentary, there is one large [[mental foramen]] (opening). The [[mandibular symphysis]], where the two halves of the lower jaw meet, is poorly preserved, but there is nothing to suggest that the left and right dentaries were fused. The lower margin of the bone is convex at the front, but concave further back, so that the depth of the dentary is 8.3&nbsp;mm (0.33 in) below the diastema, but only 7.0&nbsp;mm (0.28 in) below the third cheektooth.<ref name=Kea323/> The origin of the [[Coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]], a projection at the back of the dentary, lies far to the front.<ref name=Kea325/>\n\nThe large incisor is inclined forward, and its root&mdash;the only part of the tooth that is preserved&mdash;forms an angle of about 55\u00b0 with the horizontal. At the tip of the [[tooth alveolus|alveolus]], where the tooth projects out of the bone, it is 3.0&nbsp;mm (0.12 in) high and 2.1&nbsp;mm broad. The root extends through the dentary to a position below the third cheektooth. Only the roots of the first and second cheekteeth are preserved. Both are about 1.5&nbsp;mm in diameter, but the first tooth may have been slightly smaller than the second. The third tooth, the largest of the cheekteeth, has the root slightly curved backward.<ref name=Kea323/> This root is deeply anchored in the dentary, extending down through about three-fourths of the bone. The crown is preserved in the form of a stump of [[dentine]], 2.3&nbsp;mm (0.091 in) long and 1.9&nbsp;mm (0.075 in) broad, that extends high above the dentary, indicating that the tooth was [[hypsodont]] (high-crowned). High dentine stumps also remain of the fourth and fifth cheekteeth. The fourth is about as large as the first and second and the fifth is smaller, with a diameter of about 1.0&nbsp;mm (0.039 in).<ref name=Kea324>Krause et al., 2003, p. 324</ref> The fourth cheektooth also has a long, curved root, which extends more than halfway through the dentary, and that of the fifth tooth is even smaller and shorter. The orientation of the roots and teeth indicates that all the teeth were single-rooted.<ref name=Kea325>Krause et al., 2003, p. 325</ref>\n\n==Identity==\nThe dentary superficially resembles that of various other mammalian groups with enlarged incisors, such as [[rodent]]s, [[lagomorph]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[wombat]]s, the [[aye-aye]], and the extinct [[apatemyidae|apatemyids]], [[Tillodontia|tillodonts]], and [[taeniodont]]s&mdash;all of which are known only from the Cenozoic, less than 66 million years ago. Krause and colleagues could not exclude the possibility that TNM&nbsp;02067 represents an early member of such a group or an otherwise unknown major group of mammals. However, only two groups of Mesozoic mammals resemble TNM&nbsp;02067: [[gondwanathere]]s; and [[multituberculate]]s in the superfamilies [[Djadochtatherioidea]] and [[Taeniolabidoidea]]. Djadochtatherioids and taeniolabidoids occur in the [[late Cretaceous]] through [[Paleogene]] of the northern continents ([[Laurasia]]),<ref name=Kea325/> and gondwanatheres, an enigmatic group of uncertain evolutionary affinities, are known from the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of Gondwana, with forms such as ''[[Gondwanatherium]]'', ''[[Sudamerica]]'' (both from Argentina), ''[[Lavanify]]'' (Madagascar), and ''[[Bharattherium]]'' (India).<ref>Gurovich and Beck, 2009, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nNo multituberculates are known to have had hypsodont teeth, none has more than two molariform (molar-like) teeth in a single toothrow, and most have large, blade-like teeth. However, the form of the remains of TNM&nbsp;02067's third cheektooth suggests it was not such a blade-like tooth and that at least the last three cheekteeth were likely molariform. In these respects, TNM&nbsp;02067 does resemble gondwanatheres in the family [[Sudamericidae]], and Krause and colleagues tentatively identified it as representing that family, primarily on the basis of its hypsodont teeth.<ref>Krause et al., 2003, pp. 325&ndash;326</ref> Krause and colleagues compared the dentary in detail to that of ''Sudamerica'', the only other gondwanathere for which a substantial fragment of the jaw was known. ''Sudamerica'' has only four, not five, cheekteeth (all of which are molariform), a higher, narrower incisor with a root that extends further through the dentary, and a shorter diastema; in all these respects, TNM&nbsp;02067 is more [[primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]]. In addition, the mental foramen of the TNM&nbsp;02067 is located lower and the cheekteeth vary more in size.<ref name=Kea326>Krause et al., 2003, p. 326</ref>\n\nIf truly a gondwanathere, ''Galulatherium'' extends the known geographic range of the group to another part of Gondwana, the African mainland.<ref name=Kea326/> The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM&nbsp;02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the [[Campanian]] ''Gondwanatherium''. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early date&mdash;as early as the [[early Cretaceous]]&mdash;and consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly [[derived (phylogenetics)|derived]] group.<ref name=Kea326/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n==Literature cited==\n*Gurovich, Y. and Beck, R. 2009.
