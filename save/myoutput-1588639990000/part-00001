Staff Sergeant Kennemore, who lost both of his legs through his unselfish sacrifice, was the 23rd Marine to receive his nation's highest award for heroism in Korea. The medal was presented to him by President [[Harry S. Truman]] during ceremonies at the [[White House]] on November 24, 1952.\n\n==Biography==\nKennemore was born on June 21, 1920, in Greenville, South Carolina. He attended high school in Simpsonville, South Carolina, until 1935, and was employed by the Montgomery Ward Company, in Chicago, Illinois, before enlisting in the [[United States Marine Corps]] on June 20, 1940.\n\nCompleting his [[recruit training]] in [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]], California, in August 1940, he was stationed there until July 1942, when he sailed for the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific theater]] with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]. After serving with the division in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal-Tulagi campaign]], he returned to the United States in June 1943 for duty at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina.\n\nIn February 1944, he was ordered to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]], California, where he served until that September. He was then stationed at the Marine Barracks, Klamath Falls, Oregon, until February 1945, when he was assigned to the Marine Barracks, at the Naval Air Station, Boca Chica, Florida.\n\nIn July 1945, after brief service at Camp Lejeune, he embarked for Japan to serve on occupation duty with the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]]. He returned to the States in April 1946, and served briefly at San Diego and the Marine Barracks, New Orleans, Louisiana, until September 1946, when he began a year of duty at the Marine Barracks, Naval Mine Depot, Yorktown, Virginia. In September 1947, he was ordered to New York City, where he served for two years at Headquarters of the 3rd Marine Corps Reserve District.\n\nStaff Sergeant Kennemore joined the [[2nd Battalion 6th Marines|2nd Battalion]], [[6th Marine Regiment (United States)|6th Marine Regiment]], [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], at Camp Lejeune, in October 1949, and with the outbreak of the [[Korean War|Korean fighting]], moved with the battalion to the west coast in July 1950. The 2nd Battalion was made part of the [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th Marines]], 1st Marine Division in August 1950, and the following month, Kennemore embarked for Korea, where he served with the 2nd Battalion in the [[Second Battle of Seoul|Seoul]] and [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir|Chosin Reservoir]] campaigns.\n\nIt was at the Chosin Reservoir that he lost both of his legs.  Kennemore was fighting in a slit trench alongside two other Marines when a grenade landed beside him.  Without regard to his safety he grabbed it threw it back.  Immediately after, another grenade landed in the trench, and he used his foot to push it into the earth.  At this point he notice yet another grenade lying close by.  Without hesitation he kneeled down on the third grenade and effectively absorbed the blast of the two grenades through his legs.  Due to his actions, Kennemore saved the lives of two fellow Marines.  Kennemore returned to the United States in December 1950 for treatment at the U.S. Naval Hospital, Oakland, California. He remained there for almost a year, until his retirement on October 31, 1951.\n\nStaff Sergeant Kennemore died on April 26, 1989. He was buried in the [[San Francisco National Cemetery]], San Francisco, California.\n\n==Decorations==\n\nIn addition to the [[Medal of Honor]] and the [[Purple Heart]] he received for his wounds, SSgt Kennemore's medals and decorations include the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with two bronze stars; the [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal]] with two bronze stars in lieu of second and third awards; the [[American Defense Service Medal]]; the American Theater Campaign Medal; the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater Campaign Medal]] with two bronze stars; the [[World War II Victory Medal]]; the [[Navy Occupation Service Medal]] with Asia Clasp; the [[Korean Service Medal]] with two [[service star|bronze stars]]; and the [[United Nations Service Medal]].\n\n<center>\n{|\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Medal of Honor ribbon.svg|width=106|alt=A light blue ribbon with five white five pointed star}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Purple Heart ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=United States Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Marine Corps Good Conduct ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Campaign Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Army of Occupation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Korean_Service_Medal_-_Ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=United Nations Service Medal Korea ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|} </center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Medal of Honor]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Purple Heart]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with two bronze stars\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal]] with two bronze stars\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[American Defense Service Medal]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[American Campaign Medal]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with two bronze stars\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[World War II Victory Medal]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Navy Occupation Service Medal]] with Asia clasp\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[National Defense Service Medal]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Korean Service Medal]] with two [[service star|bronze stars]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[United Nations Service Medal]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Medal of Honor citation==\nThe [[President of the United States]] in the name of [[United States Congress|The Congress]] pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n<center>\n'''STAFF SERGEANT ROBERT S.

With the company's defensive perimeter overrun by a numerically superior hostile force during a savage night attack north of Yudam-ni and his platoon commander seriously wounded, Staff Sergeant Kennemore unhesitatingly assumed command, quickly reorganized the unit and directed the men in consolidating the position. When an enemy grenade landed in the midst of a machine-gun squad, he bravely placed his foot on the missile and, in the face of almost certain death, personally absorbed the full force of the explosion to prevent injury to his fellow Marines.
