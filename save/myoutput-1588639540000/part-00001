The mechanism is somewhat novel, as the bacteria actually enhances the production of viral genomic RNA in the cell line ''Wolbachia''. Also, the antiviral effect in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes depends on the strain of ''Wolbachia'', and the replication of the virus in orally fed mosquitoes was completely inhibited in wMelPop strain of ''Wolbachia''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hussain |first=M|author2= Lu G |author3= Torres S |author4=  Edmonds JH. |title=Effect of ''Wolbachia'' on replication of West Nile virus in a mosquito cell line and adult mosquitoes |journal=J Virol|year=2013|doi=10.1128/JVI.01837-12 |volume=87 |issue=2|pages=851\u2013858 |pmid=23115298 |pmc=3554047}}</ref>\n\n''Wolbachia'' infection can also increase mosquito resistance to malaria, as shown in ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'' where the ''w''AlbB strain of ''Wolbachia'' hindered the lifecycle of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bian|first=G|author2=Joshi D |author3=Dong Y |title=Wolbachia invades ''Anopheles stephensi'' populations and induces refractoriness to Plasmodium infection|journal=Science|year=2013|volume=340|issue=6133|pages=748\u201351|pmid=23661760|doi=10.1126/science.1236192|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2013Sci...340..748B}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Previous part: Mech. of action -->\n''Wolbachia'' may induce [[reactive oxygen species]]-dependent activation of the [[Toll (gene family)]] pathway, which is essential for activation of antimicrobial [[peptide]]s, [[defensin]]s, and [[cecropin]]s that help to inhibit virus proliferation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pan|first=X|author2=Zhou G |author3=Wu J |title=Wolbachia induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of the Toll pathway to control dengue virus in the mosquito ''Aedes aegypti'' |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|year=2012|volume=109|issue=1|pages=E23\u201331|pmc=3252928|pmid=22123956|doi=10.1073/pnas.1116932108|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2012PNAS..109E..23P}}</ref> Conversely, certain strains actually dampen the pathway, leading to higher replication of viruses. One example is with strain wAlbB in ''Culex tarsalis'', where infected mosquitoes actually carried the west nile virus (WNV) more frequently. This is because wAlbB inhibits REL1, an activator of the antiviral Toll immune pathway.
