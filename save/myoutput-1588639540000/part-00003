The group wrote the track with production team [[TMS (production team)|TMS]] and songwriters [[Iain James]], Erika Nuri, [[Michelle Lewis]], Mischke Butler and Heidi Rojas. It has a message of empowerment inspired by Little Mix's overcoming of the doubt and negativity they felt during [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|the eighth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'', being a girl band and the favourites to be eliminated after the first week of live shows. Eschewing [[dance music]] popular at the time, \"Wings\" is an uptempo [[bubblegum pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song composed of syncopated handclaps and a varying [[kick drum|kick]] and [[snare drum]] arrangement. It has a complex [[song structure]] with a double chorus that has a key change from [[E minor]] to [[E major]] halfway.\n\nThe track was released as ''DNA''{{'}}s [[lead single]] on 24 August 2012; it debuted at number one in the UK and Ireland, making it Little Mix's second consecutive number-one single in both countries. It also charted in the top 10 in Australia and Japan, the top 20 in New Zealand and at number 79 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was acclaimed by music critics who found it catchy, and complimented its chorus and the group's vocal performance. The music video shows the group dancing in front of personalised backgrounds. Little Mix promoted the single with televised performances on [[T4 on the Beach]], ''[[Friday Download]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'', ''[[Red or Black?]]'' and ''[[Daybreak (2010 TV programme)|Daybreak]]''. The song has been performed on all six of the group's concert tours, the most recent being [[LM5: The Tour]] in 2019.\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\n[[File:LittleMix2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Little Mix performing on stage with their hands raised.|Little Mix performing \"Wings\" during their 2013 [[DNA Tour]].]]\n\nLittle Mix wanted their first original single after winning [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|the eighth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' to be instantly recognisable when it was played on the radio and believed that without their own input, the track would misrepresent their sound.<ref name=\"auspOp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.auspop.com.au/2012/11/interview-little-mix/|title=Interview: Little Mix|website=auspOp|date=25 November 2012|accessdate=14 November 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514180248/https://www.auspop.com.au/2012/11/interview-little-mix/|archivedate=14 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> After working with producers for around a month and being new to group writing, the band struggled to find a song they liked.<ref name=\"auspOp\"/><ref name=\"Track By Track\">\n{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwllFinZAk|title=Little Mix - Wings (Track By Track)|publisher=Simco Limited|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=15 November 2018|via=[[YouTube]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119060514/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwllFinZAk&gl=US&hl=en|archive-date=19 November 2012|url-status=live}}\n</ref> Group member Jesy Nelson said, \"We were like, 'We want our sound to be [[Nicki Minaj]], mixed with [[Missy Elliott]] with a bit of [[En Vogue]] put in a blender.'

The group wrote the track with production team [[TMS (production team)|TMS]] and songwriters [[Iain James]], Erika Nuri, [[Michelle Lewis]], Mischke Butler and Heidi Rojas. It has a message of empowerment inspired by Little Mix's overcoming of the doubt and negativity they felt during [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|the eighth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'', being a girl band and the favourites to be eliminated after the first week of live shows. Eschewing [[dance music]] popular at the time, \"Wings\" is an uptempo [[bubblegum pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song composed of syncopated handclaps and a varying [[kick drum|kick]] and [[snare drum]] arrangement. It has a complex [[song structure]] with a double chorus that has a key change from [[E minor]] to [[E major]] halfway.\n\nThe track was released as ''DNA''{{'}}s [[lead single]] on 24 August 2012; it debuted at number one in the UK and Ireland, making it Little Mix's second consecutive number-one single in both countries. It also charted in the top 10 in Australia and Japan, the top 20 in New Zealand and at number 79 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was acclaimed by music critics who found it catchy, and complimented its chorus and the group's vocal performance. The music video shows the group dancing in front of personalised backgrounds. Little Mix promoted the single with televised performances on [[T4 on the Beach]], ''[[Friday Download]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'', ''[[Red or Black?]]'' and ''[[Daybreak (2010 TV programme)|Daybreak]]''. The song has been performed on all six of the group's concert tours, the most recent being [[LM5: The Tour]] in 2019.\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\n[[File:LittleMix2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Little Mix performing on stage with their hands raised.|Little Mix performing \"Wings\" during their 2013 [[DNA Tour]].]]\n\nLittle Mix wanted their first original single after winning [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|the eighth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' to be instantly recognisable when it was played on the radio and believed that without their own input, the track would misrepresent their sound.<ref name=\"auspOp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.auspop.com.au/2012/11/interview-little-mix/|title=Interview: Little Mix|website=auspOp|date=25 November 2012|accessdate=14 November 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514180248/https://www.auspop.com.au/2012/11/interview-little-mix/|archivedate=14 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> After working with producers for around a month and being new to group writing, the band struggled to find a song they liked.<ref name=\"auspOp\"/><ref name=\"Track By Track\">\n{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwllFinZAk|title=Little Mix - Wings (Track By Track)|publisher=Simco Limited|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=15 November 2018|via=[[YouTube]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119060514/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwllFinZAk&gl=US&hl=en|archive-date=19 November 2012|url-status=live}}\n</ref> Group member Jesy Nelson said, \"We were like, 'We want our sound to be [[Nicki Minaj]], mixed with [[Missy Elliott]] with a bit of [[En Vogue]] put in a blender.'
