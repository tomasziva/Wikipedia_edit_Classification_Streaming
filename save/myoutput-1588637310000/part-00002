The concept is named after [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848\u20131923), Italian engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]]. The following three concepts are closely related:\n\n* Given an initial situation, a '''Pareto improvement''' is a new situation which is weakly preferred by all agents, and strictly preferred by at least one agent. In a sense, it is a unanimously-agreed improvement: if we move to the new situation, some agents will gain, and no agents will lose.\n* A situation is called '''Pareto dominated''' if it has a Pareto improvement. \n* A situation is called '''Pareto optimal''' or '''Pareto efficient''' if it is not Pareto dominated.\n\nThe '''Pareto frontier''' is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, conventionally shown [[Chart|graphically]]. It also is variously known as the '''Pareto front''' or '''Pareto set'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cenaero.be/Page.asp?docid=27103&|title=Pareto Front|last=proximedia|website=www.cenaero.be|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>\n\n\"Pareto efficiency\" is considered as a minimal notion of efficiency that does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about [[Social equality|equality]], or the overall well-being of a society.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Amartya Sen |first=A. |last=Sen |title=Markets and freedom: Achievements and limitations of the market mechanism in promoting individual freedoms |journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=519\u2013541 |date=October 1993 |jstor=2663703 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos444/papers/sen.pdf |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a042106 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=N. |last=Barr |author-link=Nicholas Barr|chapter=3.2.2 The relevance of efficiency to different theories of society |title=Economics of the Welfare State |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-929781-8 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOg0BM1XiqQC&pg=PA46 46\u201349] |edition=5th}}</ref>{{rp|46\u201349}} It is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of efficiency.\n\nIn addition to the context of efficiency in ''allocation'', the concept of Pareto efficiency also arises in the context of [[productive efficiency|''efficiency in production'']] vs. ''[[x-inefficiency]]'': a set of outputs of goods is Pareto efficient if there is no feasible re-allocation of productive inputs such that output of one product increases while the outputs of all other goods either increase or remain the same.<ref>[[John D.

Each option is first assessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is ostensibly identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform the specified option.  It is a statement of impossibility of improving one variable without harming other variables in the subject of [[multi-objective optimization]] (also termed '''Pareto optimization''').\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\"Pareto optimality\" is a formally defined concept used to describe when an [[resource allocation|allocation]] is optimal. An allocation is ''not'' Pareto optimal if there is an alternative allocation where improvements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without reducing any other participant's well-being. If there is a transfer that satisfies this condition, the reallocation is called a \"Pareto improvement\". When no further Pareto improvements are possible, the allocation is a \"Pareto optimum\".\n\nThe formal presentation of the concept in an economy is as follows: Consider an economy with <math> n</math> agents and <math> k </math> goods. Then an allocation <math> \\{x_1, ..., x_n\\} </math>, where <math> x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^k </math> for all ''i'', is ''Pareto optimal'' if there is no other feasible allocation <math> \\{x_1', ..., x_n'\\} </math> such that, for utility function <math> u_i </math> for each agent <math> i </math>, <math> u_i(x_i') \\geq u_i(x_i) </math> for all <math> i \\in \\{1, ..., n\\} </math> with <math> u_i(x_i') > u_i(x_i) </math> for some <math> i</math>.<ref name=\"AndreuMas95\">{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=A.|first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510268-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198089537}}</ref> Here, in this simple economy, \"feasibility\" refers to an allocation where the total amount of each good that is allocated sums to no more than the total amount of the good in the economy. In a more complex economy with production, an allocation would consist both of consumption [[Vector space|vector]]s and production vectors, and feasibility would require that the total amount of each consumed good is no greater than the initial endowment plus the amount produced.\n\nIn principle, a change from a generally inefficient economic allocation to an efficient one is not necessarily considered to be a Pareto improvement. Even when there are overall gains in the economy, if a single agent is disadvantaged by the reallocation, the allocation is not Pareto optimal. For instance, if a change in economic policy eliminates a monopoly and that market subsequently becomes competitive, the gain to others may be large. However, since the monopolist is disadvantaged, this is not a Pareto improvement. In theory, if the gains to the economy are larger than the loss to the monopolist, the monopolist could be compensated for its loss while still leaving a net gain for others in the economy, allowing for a Pareto improvement. Thus, in practice, to ensure that nobody is disadvantaged by a change aimed at achieving Pareto efficiency, [[compensation principle|compensation]] of one or more parties may be required. It is acknowledged, in the real world, that such compensations may have [[unintended consequences]] leading to incentive distortions over time, as agents supposedly anticipate such compensations and change their actions accordingly.<ref>See [[Ricardian equivalence]]</ref>\n\nUnder the idealized conditions of the [[first welfare theorem]], a system of [[free market]]s, also called a \"[[competitive equilibrium]]\", leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome. It was first demonstrated mathematically by economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]].\n\nHowever, the result only holds under the restrictive assumptions necessary for the proof: markets exist for all possible goods, so there are no [[externality|externalities]]; all markets are in full equilibrium; markets are perfectly competitive; transaction costs are negligible; and market participants have [[perfect information]].\n\nIn the absence of perfect information or complete markets, outcomes will generally be Pareto inefficient, per the [[Joseph Stiglitz#Information asymmetry|Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/1891114 |last1=Greenwald |first1=B. |last2=Stiglitz |first2=J.

It states that under similar, ideal assumptions, any Pareto optimum can be obtained by some [[competitive equilibrium]], or [[free market]] system, although it may also require a [[lump-sum]] transfer of wealth.<ref name=\"AndreuMas95\"/>\n\n== Weak Pareto efficiency{{anchor|weak}} ==\n'''Weak Pareto optimality''' is a situation that cannot be strictly improved for ''every'' individual.<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9160-5_341|chapter = Pareto Optimality|title = Encyclopedia of Global Justice| pages=808\u2013809|year = 2011|last1 = Mock|first1 = William B T.| isbn=978-1-4020-9159-9}}</ref> \n\nFormally, we define a '''strong pareto improvement''' as a situation in which all agents are strictly better-off (in contrast to just \"Pareto improvement\", which requires that one agent is strictly better-off and the other agents are at least as good).  A situation is '''weak Pareto-optimal''' if it has no strong Pareto-improvements.\n\nAny strong Pareto-improvement is also a weak Pareto-improvement. The opposite is not true; for example, consider a resource allocation problem with two resources, which Alice values at 10, 0 and George values at 5, 5. Consider the allocation giving all resources to Alice, where the utility profile is (10,0).\n\n* It is a weak-PO, since no other allocation is strictly better to both agents (there are no strong Pareto improvements). \n* But it is not a strong-PO, since the allocation in which George gets the second resource is strictly better for George and weakly better for Alice (it is a weak Pareto improvement) - its utility profile is (10,5).\n\nA market doesn't require [[local nonsatiation]] to get to a weak Pareto-optimum.<ref>Markey\u2010Towler, Brendan and John Foster. \"[http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/abstract/476.pdf Why economic theory has little to say about the causes and effects of inequality]\", School of Economics, [[University of Queensland]], Australia, 21 February 2013, RePEc:qld:uq2004:476</ref>\n\n== Constrained Pareto efficiency {{anchor|Constrained Pareto efficiency}}==\n'''Constrained Pareto optimality''' is a weakening of Pareto-optimality, accounting for the fact that a potential planner (e.g., the government) may not be able to improve upon a decentralized market outcome, even if that outcome is inefficient. This will occur if it is limited by the same informational or institutional constraints as are individual agents.<ref>Magill, M., & [[Martine Quinzii|Quinzii, M.]], ''Theory of Incomplete Markets'', MIT Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d66GXq2F2M0C&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 104].</ref>{{rp|104}}\n\nAn example is of a setting where individuals have private information (for example, a labor market where the worker's own productivity is known to the worker but not to a potential employer, or a used-car market where the quality of a car is known to the seller but not to the buyer) which results in [[moral hazard]] or an [[adverse selection]] and a sub-optimal outcome. In such a case, a planner who wishes to improve the situation is unlikely to have access to any information that the participants in the markets do not have. Hence, the planner cannot implement allocation rules which are based on the idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals; for example, \"if a person is of type A, they pay price p1, but if of type B, they pay price p2\" (see [[Lindahl prices]]). Essentially, only anonymous rules are allowed (of the sort \"Everyone pays price p\") or rules based on observable behavior; \"if any person chooses x at price px, then they get a subsidy of ten dollars, and nothing otherwise\". If there exists no allowed rule that can successfully improve upon the market outcome, then that outcome is said to be \"constrained Pareto-optimal\".\n\nThe concept of constrained Pareto optimality assumes benevolence on the part of the planner and hence is distinct from the concept of [[government failure]], which occurs when the policy making politicians fail to achieve an optimal outcome simply because they are not necessarily acting in the public's best interest.\n\n== Fractional Pareto efficiency{{anchor|fractional}} ==\n'''Fractional Pareto optimality''' is a strengthening of Pareto-optimality in the context of [[fair item allocation]]. An allocation of indivisible items is '''fractionally Pareto-optimal (fPO)''' if it is not Pareto-dominated even by an allocation in which some items are split between agents. This is in contrast to standard Pareto-optimality, which only considers domination by feasible (discrete) allocations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3219166.3219176|title=Finding Fair and Efficient Allocations {{!}} Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation|website=dl.acm.org|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3219166.3219176|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, consider an item allocation problem with two items, which Alice values at 3, 2 and George values at 4, 1. Consider the allocation giving the first item to Alice and the second to George, where the utility profile is (3,1).\n\n* It is Pareto-optimal, since any other discrete allocation (without splitting items) makes someone worse-off. \n* However, it is not fractionally-Pareto-optimal, since it is Pareto-dominated by the allocation giving to Alice 1/2 of the first item and the whole second item, and the other 1/2 of the first item to George - its utility profile is (3.5, 2).\n\n== Pareto-efficiency and welfare-maximization ==\n{{See also|Pareto-efficient envy-free division}}\nSuppose each agent ''i'' is assigned a positive weight ''a<sub>i</sub>''. For every allocation ''x'', define the ''welfare'' of ''x'' as the weighted sum of utilities of all agents in ''x'', i.e.:\n\n<math>W_a(x) := \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i u_i(x)</math>.\n\nLet ''x<sub>a</sub>'' be an allocation that maximizes the welfare over all allocations, i.e.:\n\n<math>x_a \\in \\arg \\max_{x} W_a(x)</math>.\n\nIt is easy to show that the allocation ''x<sub>a</sub>'' is Pareto-efficient: since all weights are positive, any Pareto-improvement would increase the sum, contradicting the definition of ''x<sub>a</sub>''.\n\nJapanese neo-[[L\u00e9on_Walras#General_equilibrium_theory|Walrasian]] economist [[Takashi Negishi]] proved<ref>{{cite journal |last=Negishi |first=Takashi |date=1960 |title=Welfare Economics and Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy |journal=Metroeconomica |volume=12 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=92\u201397 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-999X.1960.tb00275.x }}</ref> that, under certain assumptions, the opposite is also true: for ''every'' Pareto-efficient allocation ''x'', there exists a positive vector ''a'' such that ''x'' maximizes ''W''<sub>a</sub>.

Finding Pareto frontiers is particularly useful in engineering. By yielding all of the potentially optimal solutions, a designer can make focused [[Trade-off|tradeoffs]] within this constrained set of parameters, rather than needing to consider the full ranges of parameters.<ref>Costa, N.

Consider a system with function <math>f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m</math>, where ''X'' is a [[compact space|compact set]] of feasible decisions in the [[metric space]] <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, and ''Y'' is the feasible set of criterion vectors in <math>\\mathbb{R}^m</math>, such that <math>Y = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m:\\; y = f(x), x \\in X\\;\\}</math>.\n\nWe assume that the preferred directions of criteria values are known. A point <math>y^{\\prime\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m</math> is preferred to (strictly dominates) another point <math>y^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m</math>, written as <math>y^{\\prime\\prime} \\succ y^{\\prime}</math>. The Pareto frontier is thus written as:\n\n: <math>P(Y) = \\{ y^\\prime \\in Y: \\; \\{y^{\\prime\\prime} \\in Y:\\; y^{\\prime\\prime} \\succ y^{\\prime}, y^\\prime \\neq y^{\\prime\\prime} \\; \\} = \\empty \\}. </math>\n\n=== Marginal rate of substitution ===\nA significant aspect of the Pareto frontier in economics is that, at a Pareto-efficient allocation, the [[marginal rate of substitution]] is the same for all consumers.  A formal statement can be derived by considering a system with ''m'' consumers and ''n'' goods, and a utility function of each consumer as <math>z_i=f^i(x^i)</math> where <math>x^i=(x_1^i, x_2^i, \\ldots, x_n^i)</math> is the vector of goods, both for all ''i''. The feasibility constraint is <math>\\sum_{i=1}^m x_j^i = b_j</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math>. To find the Pareto optimal allocation, we maximize the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]:\n\n: <math>L_i((x_j^k)_{k,j}, (\\lambda_k)_k, (\\mu_j)_j)=f^i(x^i)+\\sum_{k=2}^m \\lambda_k(z_k- f^k(x^k))+\\sum_{j=1}^n \\mu_j \\left( b_j-\\sum_{k=1}^m x_j^k \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>(\\lambda_k)_k</math> and <math>(\\mu_j)_j</math> are the vectors of multipliers. Taking the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to each good <math>x_j^k</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math> and <math>k=1,\\ldots, m</math> and gives the following system of first-order conditions:\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial x_j^i} = f_{x^i_j}^1-\\mu_j=0\\text{ for }j=1,\\ldots,n,</math>\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial x_j^k} = -\\lambda_k f_{x^k_j}^i-\\mu_j=0 \\text{ for }k= 2,\\ldots,m \\text{ and }j=1,\\ldots,n,</math>\n\nwhere <math>f_{x^i_j}</math> denotes the partial derivative of <math>f</math> with respect to <math>x_j^i</math>. Now, fix any <math>k\\neq i</math> and <math>j,s\\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}</math>. The above first-order condition imply that\n\n: <math>\\frac{f_{x_j^i}^i}{f_{x_s^i}^i}=\\frac{\\mu_j}{\\mu_s}=\\frac{f_{x_j^k}^k}{f_{x_s^k}^k}.</math>\n\nThus, in a Pareto-optimal allocation, the marginal rate of substitution must be the same for all consumers.<ref>Wilkerson, T., ''Advanced Economic Theory'' ([[Waltham Abbey]]: Edtech Press, 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UtW_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 p. 114].</ref>{{rp|114}}\n\n=== Computation ===\n[[Algorithm]]s for computing the Pareto frontier of a finite set of alternatives have been studied in [[computer science]] and power engineering.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/en6031439 |last1=Tomoiag\u0103 |first1=Bogdan |last2=Chindri\u015f |first2=Mircea |last3=Sumper |first3=Andreas |last4=Sudria-Andreu |first4=Antoni |last5=Villafafila-Robles |first5=Roberto |title=Pareto Optimal Reconfiguration of Power Distribution Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm Based on NSGA-II |journal=Energies |year=2013 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=1439\u201355 |doi-access=free }}</ref> They include:\n\n* \"The maximum vector problem\" or the [[Skyline operator|skyline query]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0020-0190(96)00116-0 |last1=Nielsen |first1=Frank |title=Output-sensitive peeling of convex and maximal layers |journal=Information Processing Letters |volume=59 |pages=255\u20139 |year=1996 |issue=5 |citeseerx=10.1.1.259.1042 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/321906.321910 |last1=Kung |first1=H.

This possibility is inherent in the definition of Pareto efficiency; often the [[status quo]] is Pareto efficient regardless of the degree to which wealth is equitably distributed. A simple example is the distribution of a pie among three people. The most equitable distribution would assign one third to each person. However the assignment of, say, a half section to each of two individuals and none to the third is also Pareto optimal despite not being equitable, because none of the recipients could be made better off without decreasing someone else's share; and there are many other such distribution examples. An example of a Pareto inefficient distribution of the pie would be allocation of a quarter of the pie to each of the three, with the remainder discarded.<ref>Wittman, D., ''Economic Foundations of Law and Organization'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fOolQOtKM7QC&pg=PA18 p. 18].</ref>{{rp|18}} The origin (and utility value) of the pie is conceived as immaterial in these examples. In such cases, whereby a \"windfall\" is gained that none of the potential distributees actually produced (e.g., land, inherited wealth, a portion of the broadcast spectrum, or some other resource), the criterion of Pareto efficiency does not determine a unique optimal allocation. Wealth consolidation may exclude others from wealth accumulation because of bars to market entry, etc.\n\nThe [[liberal paradox]] elaborated by [[Amartya Sen]] shows that when people have preferences about what other people do, the goal of Pareto efficiency can come into conflict with the goal of individual liberty.<ref>Sen, A., ''Rationality and Freedom'' ([[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, MA]] / London: [[Harvard University Press|Belknep Press]], 2004), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=DaOY4DQ-MKAC&pg=PA92 pp. 92\u201394].</ref>{{rp|92\u201394}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Admissible decision rule]], analog in [[decision theory]]\n* [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]\n* [[Bayesian efficiency]]\n* [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics]]\n* [[Deadweight loss]]\n* [[Economic efficiency]]\n* [[Highest and best use]]\n* [[Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency]]\n* [[Market failure]], when a market result is not Pareto optimal\n* [[Maximal element]], concept in [[order theory]]\n* [[Maxima of a point set]]\n* [[Multi-objective optimization]]\n* [[Pareto-efficient envy-free division]]\n* ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' for the '(weak) Pareto principle'\n* [[Trade-off talking rational economic person|TOTREP]]\n* [[Welfare economics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite Fudenberg Tirole 1991|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pFPHKwXro3QC&pg=PA18 18\u201323]}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1=Bendor | first1=Jonathan |last2= Mookherjee | first2=Dilip | title = Communitarian versus Universalistic norms | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201361 | doi = 10.1561/100.00007028 | date = April 2008 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite journal | last = Kanbur | first = Ravi| author-link = Ravi Kanbur | title = Pareto's revenge | journal = Journal of Social and Economic Development | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201311 | date = January\u2013June 2005 | url = http://www.arts.cornell.edu/poverty/kanbur/ParRev.pdf | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Ng | first = Yew-Kwang | author-link = Yew-Kwang Ng | title = Welfare economics towards a more complete analysis | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-2GDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780333971215 }}\n* {{Citation | author-first1=Ariel | author-last1=Rubinstein | author-first2=Martin J. | author-last2=Osborne | author-link1 = Ariel Rubinstein | contribution = Introduction | editor-first1=Ariel | editor-last1=Rubinstein | editor-first2=Martin J. | editor-last2=Osborne | editor-link1 = Ariel Rubinstein | title = A course in game theory | pages = 6\u20137 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780262650403 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ntdaYX4LPkC&pg=PA6 Book preview.]\n* {{Cite journal | last = Mathur | first = Vijay K. | title = How well do we know Pareto optimality? | journal = The Journal of Economic Education | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 172\u2013178 | doi = 10.2307/1182422 | date = Spring 1991 | ref = harv | jstor = 1182422 }}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Newbery | first1 = David M.G. | last2 = Stiglitz | first2 = Joseph E. | author-link1 = David Newbery | author-link2 = Joseph Stiglitz | title = Pareto inferior trade | journal = Review of Economic Studies | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201312 | doi = 10.2307/2297701 | date = January 1984 | ref = harv | jstor = 2297701 }}\n\n{{Economics}}\n{{Game theory}}\n{{Voting systems}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pareto Efficiency}}\n[[Category:Game theory]]\n[[Category:Law and economics]]\n[[Category:Welfare economics]]\n[[Category:Pareto efficiency]]\n[[Category:Mathematical optimization]]\n[[Category:Electoral system criteria]]\n[[Category:Vilfredo Pareto]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|State in which no reallocation of resources can make everyone at least as well off}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2016}}\n\n'''Pareto efficiency''' or '''Pareto optimality''' is a situation that cannot be modified so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off. The concept is named after [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848\u20131923), Italian engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]]. The following three concepts are closely related:\n\n* Given an initial situation, a '''Pareto improvement''' is a new situation which is weakly preferred by all agents, and strictly preferred by at least one agent. In a sense, it is a unanimously-agreed improvement: if we move to the new situation, some agents will gain, and no agents will lose.\n* A situation is called '''Pareto dominated''' if it has a Pareto improvement. \n* A situation is called '''Pareto optimal''' or '''Pareto efficient''' if it is not Pareto dominated.\n\nThe '''Pareto frontier''' is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, conventionally shown [[Chart|graphically]]. It also is variously known as the '''Pareto front''' or '''Pareto set'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cenaero.be/Page.asp?docid=27103&|title=Pareto Front|last=proximedia|website=www.cenaero.be|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>\n\n\"Pareto efficiency\" is considered as a minimal notion of efficiency that does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about [[Social equality|equality]], or the overall well-being of a society.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Amartya Sen |first=A. |last=Sen |title=Markets and freedom: Achievements and limitations of the market mechanism in promoting individual freedoms |journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=519\u2013541 |date=October 1993 |jstor=2663703 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos444/papers/sen.pdf |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a042106 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=N. |last=Barr |author-link=Nicholas Barr|chapter=3.2.2 The relevance of efficiency to different theories of society |title=Economics of the Welfare State |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-929781-8 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOg0BM1XiqQC&pg=PA46 46\u201349] |edition=5th}}</ref>{{rp|46\u201349}} It is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of efficiency.\n\nIn addition to the context of efficiency in ''allocation'', the concept of Pareto efficiency also arises in the context of [[productive efficiency|''efficiency in production'']] vs. ''[[x-inefficiency]]'': a set of outputs of goods is Pareto efficient if there is no feasible re-allocation of productive inputs such that output of one product increases while the outputs of all other goods either increase or remain the same.<ref>[[John D.

Each option is first assessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is ostensibly identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform the specified option.  It is a statement of impossibility of improving one variable without harming other variables in the subject of [[multi-objective optimization]] (also termed '''Pareto optimization''').\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\"Pareto optimality\" is a formally defined concept used to describe when an [[resource allocation|allocation]] is optimal. An allocation is ''not'' Pareto optimal if there is an alternative allocation where improvements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without reducing any other participant's well-being. If there is a transfer that satisfies this condition, the reallocation is called a \"Pareto improvement\". When no further Pareto improvements are possible, the allocation is a \"Pareto optimum\".\n\nThe formal presentation of the concept in an economy is as follows: Consider an economy with <math> n</math> agents and <math> k </math> goods. Then an allocation <math> \\{x_1, ..., x_n\\} </math>, where <math> x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^k </math> for all ''i'', is ''Pareto optimal'' if there is no other feasible allocation <math> \\{x_1', ..., x_n'\\} </math> such that, for utility function <math> u_i </math> for each agent <math> i </math>, <math> u_i(x_i') \\geq u_i(x_i) </math> for all <math> i \\in \\{1, ..., n\\} </math> with <math> u_i(x_i') > u_i(x_i) </math> for some <math> i</math>.<ref name=\"AndreuMas95\">{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=A.|first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510268-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198089537}}</ref> Here, in this simple economy, \"feasibility\" refers to an allocation where the total amount of each good that is allocated sums to no more than the total amount of the good in the economy. In a more complex economy with production, an allocation would consist both of consumption [[Vector space|vector]]s and production vectors, and feasibility would require that the total amount of each consumed good is no greater than the initial endowment plus the amount produced.\n\nIn principle, a change from a generally inefficient economic allocation to an efficient one is not necessarily considered to be a Pareto improvement. Even when there are overall gains in the economy, if a single agent is disadvantaged by the reallocation, the allocation is not Pareto optimal. For instance, if a change in economic policy eliminates a monopoly and that market subsequently becomes competitive, the gain to others may be large. However, since the monopolist is disadvantaged, this is not a Pareto improvement. In theory, if the gains to the economy are larger than the loss to the monopolist, the monopolist could be compensated for its loss while still leaving a net gain for others in the economy, allowing for a Pareto improvement. Thus, in practice, to ensure that nobody is disadvantaged by a change aimed at achieving Pareto efficiency, [[compensation principle|compensation]] of one or more parties may be required. It is acknowledged, in the real world, that such compensations may have [[unintended consequences]] leading to incentive distortions over time, as agents supposedly anticipate such compensations and change their actions accordingly.<ref>See [[Ricardian equivalence]]</ref>\n\nUnder the idealized conditions of the [[first welfare theorem]], a system of [[free market]]s, also called a \"[[competitive equilibrium]]\", leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome. It was first demonstrated mathematically by economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]].\n\nHowever, the result only holds under the restrictive assumptions necessary for the proof: markets exist for all possible goods, so there are no [[externality|externalities]]; all markets are in full equilibrium; markets are perfectly competitive; transaction costs are negligible; and market participants have [[perfect information]].\n\nIn the absence of perfect information or complete markets, outcomes will generally be Pareto inefficient, per the [[Joseph Stiglitz#Information asymmetry|Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/1891114 |last1=Greenwald |first1=B. |last2=Stiglitz |first2=J.

It states that under similar, ideal assumptions, any Pareto optimum can be obtained by some [[competitive equilibrium]], or [[free market]] system, although it may also require a [[lump-sum]] transfer of wealth.<ref name=\"AndreuMas95\"/>\n\n== Weak Pareto efficiency{{anchor|weak}} ==\n'''Weak Pareto optimality''' is a situation that cannot be strictly improved for ''every'' individual.<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9160-5_341|chapter = Pareto Optimality|title = Encyclopedia of Global Justice| pages=808\u2013809|year = 2011|last1 = Mock|first1 = William B T.| isbn=978-1-4020-9159-9}}</ref> \n\nFormally, we define a '''strong pareto improvement''' as a situation in which all agents are strictly better-off (in contrast to just \"Pareto improvement\", which requires that one agent is strictly better-off and the other agents are at least as good).  A situation is '''weak Pareto-optimal''' if it has no strong Pareto-improvements.\n\nAny strong Pareto-improvement is also a weak Pareto-improvement. The opposite is not true; for example, consider a resource allocation problem with two resources, which Alice values at 10, 0 and George values at 5, 5. Consider the allocation giving all resources to Alice, where the utility profile is (10,0).\n\n* It is a weak-PO, since no other allocation is strictly better to both agents (there are no strong Pareto improvements). \n* But it is not a strong-PO, since the allocation in which Bob gets the second resource is strictly better for George and weakly better for Alice (it is a weak Pareto improvement) - its utility profile is (10,5).\n\nA market doesn't require [[local nonsatiation]] to get to a weak Pareto-optimum.<ref>Markey\u2010Towler, Brendan and John Foster. \"[http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/abstract/476.pdf Why economic theory has little to say about the causes and effects of inequality]\", School of Economics, [[University of Queensland]], Australia, 21 February 2013, RePEc:qld:uq2004:476</ref>\n\n== Constrained Pareto efficiency {{anchor|Constrained Pareto efficiency}}==\n'''Constrained Pareto optimality''' is a weakening of Pareto-optimality, accounting for the fact that a potential planner (e.g., the government) may not be able to improve upon a decentralized market outcome, even if that outcome is inefficient. This will occur if it is limited by the same informational or institutional constraints as are individual agents.<ref>Magill, M., & [[Martine Quinzii|Quinzii, M.]], ''Theory of Incomplete Markets'', MIT Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d66GXq2F2M0C&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 104].</ref>{{rp|104}}\n\nAn example is of a setting where individuals have private information (for example, a labor market where the worker's own productivity is known to the worker but not to a potential employer, or a used-car market where the quality of a car is known to the seller but not to the buyer) which results in [[moral hazard]] or an [[adverse selection]] and a sub-optimal outcome. In such a case, a planner who wishes to improve the situation is unlikely to have access to any information that the participants in the markets do not have. Hence, the planner cannot implement allocation rules which are based on the idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals; for example, \"if a person is of type A, they pay price p1, but if of type B, they pay price p2\" (see [[Lindahl prices]]). Essentially, only anonymous rules are allowed (of the sort \"Everyone pays price p\") or rules based on observable behavior; \"if any person chooses x at price px, then they get a subsidy of ten dollars, and nothing otherwise\". If there exists no allowed rule that can successfully improve upon the market outcome, then that outcome is said to be \"constrained Pareto-optimal\".\n\nThe concept of constrained Pareto optimality assumes benevolence on the part of the planner and hence is distinct from the concept of [[government failure]], which occurs when the policy making politicians fail to achieve an optimal outcome simply because they are not necessarily acting in the public's best interest.\n\n== Fractional Pareto efficiency{{anchor|fractional}} ==\n'''Fractional Pareto optimality''' is a strengthening of Pareto-optimality in the context of [[fair item allocation]]. An allocation of indivisible items is '''fractionally Pareto-optimal (fPO)''' if it is not Pareto-dominated even by an allocation in which some items are split between agents. This is in contrast to standard Pareto-optimality, which only considers domination by feasible (discrete) allocations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3219166.3219176|title=Finding Fair and Efficient Allocations {{!}} Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation|website=dl.acm.org|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3219166.3219176|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, consider an item allocation problem with two items, which Alice values at 3, 2 and George values at 4, 1. Consider the allocation giving the first item to Alice and the second to George, where the utility profile is (3,1).\n\n* It is Pareto-optimal, since any other discrete allocation (without splitting items) makes someone worse-off. \n* However, it is not fractionally-Pareto-optimal, since it is Pareto-dominated by the allocation giving to Alice 1/2 of the first item and the whole second item, and the other 1/2 of the first item to George - its utility profile is (3.5, 2).\n\n== Pareto-efficiency and welfare-maximization ==\n{{See also|Pareto-efficient envy-free division}}\nSuppose each agent ''i'' is assigned a positive weight ''a<sub>i</sub>''. For every allocation ''x'', define the ''welfare'' of ''x'' as the weighted sum of utilities of all agents in ''x'', i.e.:\n\n<math>W_a(x) := \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i u_i(x)</math>.\n\nLet ''x<sub>a</sub>'' be an allocation that maximizes the welfare over all allocations, i.e.:\n\n<math>x_a \\in \\arg \\max_{x} W_a(x)</math>.\n\nIt is easy to show that the allocation ''x<sub>a</sub>'' is Pareto-efficient: since all weights are positive, any Pareto-improvement would increase the sum, contradicting the definition of ''x<sub>a</sub>''.\n\nJapanese neo-[[L\u00e9on_Walras#General_equilibrium_theory|Walrasian]] economist [[Takashi Negishi]] proved<ref>{{cite journal |last=Negishi |first=Takashi |date=1960 |title=Welfare Economics and Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy |journal=Metroeconomica |volume=12 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=92\u201397 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-999X.1960.tb00275.x }}</ref> that, under certain assumptions, the opposite is also true: for ''every'' Pareto-efficient allocation ''x'', there exists a positive vector ''a'' such that ''x'' maximizes ''W''<sub>a</sub>.

Consider a system with function <math>f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m</math>, where ''X'' is a [[compact space|compact set]] of feasible decisions in the [[metric space]] <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, and ''Y'' is the feasible set of criterion vectors in <math>\\mathbb{R}^m</math>, such that <math>Y = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m:\\; y = f(x), x \\in X\\;\\}</math>.\n\nWe assume that the preferred directions of criteria values are known.

The Pareto frontier is thus written as:\n\n: <math>P(Y) = \\{ y^\\prime \\in Y: \\; \\{y^{\\prime\\prime} \\in Y:\\; y^{\\prime\\prime} \\succ y^{\\prime}, y^\\prime \\neq y^{\\prime\\prime} \\; \\} = \\empty \\}. </math>\n\n=== Marginal rate of substitution ===\nA significant aspect of the Pareto frontier in economics is that, at a Pareto-efficient allocation, the [[marginal rate of substitution]] is the same for all consumers.  A formal statement can be derived by considering a system with ''m'' consumers and ''n'' goods, and a utility function of each consumer as <math>z_i=f^i(x^i)</math> where <math>x^i=(x_1^i, x_2^i, \\ldots, x_n^i)</math> is the vector of goods, both for all ''i''. The feasibility constraint is <math>\\sum_{i=1}^m x_j^i = b_j</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math>. To find the Pareto optimal allocation, we maximize the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]:\n\n: <math>L_i((x_j^k)_{k,j}, (\\lambda_k)_k, (\\mu_j)_j)=f^i(x^i)+\\sum_{k=2}^m \\lambda_k(z_k- f^k(x^k))+\\sum_{j=1}^n \\mu_j \\left( b_j-\\sum_{k=1}^m x_j^k \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>(\\lambda_k)_k</math> and <math>(\\mu_j)_j</math> are the vectors of multipliers.

This possibility is inherent in the definition of Pareto efficiency; often the [[status quo]] is Pareto efficient regardless of the degree to which wealth is equitably distributed. A simple example is the distribution of a pie among three people. The most equitable distribution would assign one third to each person. However the assignment of, say, a half section to each of two individuals and none to the third is also Pareto optimal despite not being equitable, because none of the recipients could be made better off without decreasing someone else's share; and there are many other such distribution examples. An example of a Pareto inefficient distribution of the pie would be allocation of a quarter of the pie to each of the three, with the remainder discarded.<ref>Wittman, D., ''Economic Foundations of Law and Organization'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fOolQOtKM7QC&pg=PA18 p. 18].</ref>{{rp|18}} The origin (and utility value) of the pie is conceived as immaterial in these examples. In such cases, whereby a \"windfall\" is gained that none of the potential distributees actually produced (e.g., land, inherited wealth, a portion of the broadcast spectrum, or some other resource), the criterion of Pareto efficiency does not determine a unique optimal allocation. Wealth consolidation may exclude others from wealth accumulation because of bars to market entry, etc.\n\nThe [[liberal paradox]] elaborated by [[Amartya Sen]] shows that when people have preferences about what other people do, the goal of Pareto efficiency can come into conflict with the goal of individual liberty.<ref>Sen, A., ''Rationality and Freedom'' ([[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, MA]] / London: [[Harvard University Press|Belknep Press]], 2004), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=DaOY4DQ-MKAC&pg=PA92 pp. 92\u201394].</ref>{{rp|92\u201394}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Admissible decision rule]], analog in [[decision theory]]\n* [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]\n* [[Bayesian efficiency]]\n* [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics]]\n* [[Deadweight loss]]\n* [[Economic efficiency]]\n* [[Highest and best use]]\n* [[Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency]]\n* [[Market failure]], when a market result is not Pareto optimal\n* [[Maximal element]], concept in [[order theory]]\n* [[Maxima of a point set]]\n* [[Multi-objective optimization]]\n* [[Pareto-efficient envy-free division]]\n* ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' for the '(weak) Pareto principle'\n* [[Trade-off talking rational economic person|TOTREP]]\n* [[Welfare economics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite Fudenberg Tirole 1991|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pFPHKwXro3QC&pg=PA18 18\u201323]}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1=Bendor | first1=Jonathan |last2= Mookherjee | first2=Dilip | title = Communitarian versus Universalistic norms | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201361 | doi = 10.1561/100.00007028 | date = April 2008 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite journal | last = Kanbur | first = Ravi| author-link = Ravi Kanbur | title = Pareto's revenge | journal = Journal of Social and Economic Development | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201311 | date = January\u2013June 2005 | url = http://www.arts.cornell.edu/poverty/kanbur/ParRev.pdf | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Ng | first = Yew-Kwang | author-link = Yew-Kwang Ng | title = Welfare economics towards a more complete analysis | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-2GDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780333971215 }}\n* {{Citation | author-first1=Ariel | author-last1=Rubinstein | author-first2=Martin J. | author-last2=Osborne | author-link1 = Ariel Rubinstein | contribution = Introduction | editor-first1=Ariel | editor-last1=Rubinstein | editor-first2=Martin J. | editor-last2=Osborne | editor-link1 = Ariel Rubinstein | title = A course in game theory | pages = 6\u20137 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780262650403 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ntdaYX4LPkC&pg=PA6 Book preview.]\n* {{Cite journal | last = Mathur | first = Vijay K. | title = How well do we know Pareto optimality? | journal = The Journal of Economic Education | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 172\u2013178 | doi = 10.2307/1182422 | date = Spring 1991 | ref = harv | jstor = 1182422 }}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Newbery | first1 = David M.G. | last2 = Stiglitz | first2 = Joseph E. | author-link1 = David Newbery | author-link2 = Joseph Stiglitz | title = Pareto inferior trade | journal = Review of Economic Studies | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201312 | doi = 10.2307/2297701 | date = January 1984 | ref = harv | jstor = 2297701 }}\n\n{{Economics}}\n{{Game theory}}\n{{Voting systems}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pareto Efficiency}}\n[[Category:Game theory]]\n[[Category:Law and economics]]\n[[Category:Welfare economics]]\n[[Category:Pareto efficiency]]\n[[Category:Mathematical optimization]]\n[[Category:Electoral system criteria]]\n[[Category:Vilfredo Pareto]]\n", "name_user": "Sonata Green", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWeak Pareto efficiency{{anchor|weak}}:georged a stray bob", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"}
