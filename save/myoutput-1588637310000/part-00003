Located between West [[Manchester Boulevard]], across [[Laffit Pincay, Jr.|Pincay Drive]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Kareem Court]], it is north of the under-construction [[SoFi Stadium]] and the [[Hollywood Park Casino]]. It is about {{convert|3|mi}} east of [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX). Opening on December 30, 1967, the Forum was an unusual and groundbreaking structure. Architect Charles Luckman's vision was brought to life by engineers Carl Johnson and [[Svend Nielsen (architect and engineer)|Svend Nielsen]], who were able to engineer the structure so that it had no major support pillars. This had previously been unheard of in an indoor arena the size of the Forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pe/obituary.aspx?pid=165203056 |title=Svend Nielsen Obituary - Riverside, CA &#124; The Press-Enterprise |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe arena is visible on the landing approach to the [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] from the east. With [[Madison Square Garden]], it was once one of the best-known indoor sports venues in the U.S. The Forum achieved its greatest fame as home to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[Los Angeles Kings]] of the [[National Hockey League]] from 1967 to 1999, when the teams moved to [[Staples Center]] to join the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] (who moved to Staples Center from the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]). The Forum was also the home of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]'s [[Los Angeles Sparks]] from 1997 to their 2001 move to [[Staples Center]].\n\nThe Forum was the site of the [[1972 NBA All-Star Game|1972]] and [[1983 NBA All-Star Game]]s, the [[33rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1981 NHL All-Star Game]], 1984 [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball]] and hosted the [[Big West Conference]] (from 1983 to 1988) and the 1989 [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10 Conference]] men's basketball tournaments. It was acquired in 2000 by the Faithful Central Bible Church, which used it for occasional [[church service]]s and leased it for sporting events, concerts and other events. In 2012, the Forum was purchased by the [[Madison Square Garden Company]] (MSG), owners of New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]], for $23.5&nbsp;million; MSG announced plans to renovate the arena as a world-class concert venue.<ref name=\"Vincent\">{{cite news |title=Forum Owners Plan to Revive Venue with $50-Million Renovation|first=Roger|last=Vincent|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/26/business/la-fi-forum-20120626|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 26, 2012|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref> On September 24, 2014, the Forum was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe arena is formally known as '''The Forum Presented by Chase''',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/las-forum-get-765-million-595536 |title=L.A.'s The Forum to Get $76.5 Million Makeover and Reopen With Eagles Concerts |last1=Bond |first1=Paul |date=July 30, 2013 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref> and has previously been known as the '''Great Western Forum'''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/07/business/the-media-business-great-western-s-name-on-los-angeles-forum.html |title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Great Western's Name On Los Angeles Forum|last1=Adelson |first1=Andrea |date=December 7, 1988 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref> and nicknamed the \"Fabulous Forum\" by Lakers announcer [[Chick Hearn]].<ref name=\"Ballmer\" /> It is also known informally as the '''L.A.

The arena seats 17,505 for basketball, 16,005 for hockey and up to 18,000 for musical concerts; although it has no luxury suites, it had 2,400 [[Club seating|club seats]] for events. More than 70% of the seats are between the goals, and no seat is more than {{convert|170|ft}} from the playing surface.\n\nThe Forum became a landmark in [[greater Los Angeles]], largely due to the Lakers' success and the [[Hollywood]] celebrities often seen there. It hosted tennis matches, music concerts, [[boxing]] matches and U. S. political events. The arena is sometimes called the \"Los Angeles Forum\" or the \"L. A. Forum\" to distinguish it from other places with the name \"Forum\".\n\nDuring the Cooke era, the Forum hosted five NBA Finals in its first six years (1967\u201373). The [[Boston Celtics]] celebrated both the {{nbafy|1968}} and {{nbafy|1969}} championships in the arena, the latter of which marked the final games [[Bill Russell]] ever played. The Lakers won the [[1972 NBA Finals]] at the Forum in Game 5, while the [[New York Knicks]]' second and most recent championship was also clinched in a Game 5 at the same venue [[1973 NBA Finals|the following season]].\n\n[[Cream (band)|Cream]] played two shows during the band's farewell tour, on October 18\u201319, 1968, with [[Deep Purple]] the opening act. The band's show of October 19 produced the live tracks on their farewell LP, ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]''. Deep Purple also recorded their part of the show, which was later released as a live album entitled ''[[Inglewood \u2013 Live in California]]''.\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young recorded shows in June and July of 1970, including at the Forum. Some of which ended up on their 1971 live album, \u201c4 Way Street\u201d.\n\n[[The Rolling Stones]] performed at the Forum during their 1969, 1972 and 1975 North American tours. [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] played there during their ''[[At Your Birthday Party]]'' tour on July 14, 1969, with [[Three Dog Night]] the opening act. Three Dog Night recorded their set, which was later released as a live album entitled ''[[Captured Live at the Forum]]''. [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] performed at the forum for the first time on April 26th, 1969. A Soundboard recording of this concert has been released on Experience Hendrix's Dagger Records, a official bootleg record label. The Experience later performed their again the following year on April 25th, 1970, as part of their final U.S. tour. The concert has been widely circulated thanks to 3 available bootleg audience recordings. \n\nBetween 1970 and 1977 [[Led Zeppelin]] performed 16 times at the Forum, including a run of six sold-out dates in 1977. Part of their live album, ''[[How the West Was Won (Led Zeppelin album)|How the West Was Won]]'', was recorded at the arena. The band's first 1977 show is the source of the [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] ''[[Listen to This Eddie]]''. Another bootleg from the Forum shows, ''[[For Badgeholders Only]]'', contains one of the last live performances by [[Keith Moon]] on drums, with his surprise performance there.\n\n[[The Jackson 5]] performed twice at the Forum: on June 20, 1970, during their [[The Jackson 5 First National Tour|first national tour]] and on August 26, 1972 during their third national tour. The 1970 show broke attendance records, with 18,675 paid admissions and a gross income of $105,000 (when the Jackson 5 had released two albums and three singles). By 1972, they had released seven albums on [[Motown]], in addition to [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] and [[Jermaine Jackson]]'s solo albums. Both shows were recorded and released as ''[[Live at the Forum (The Jackson 5 album)|Live at the Forum]]''.\n\nOn November 14, 1970, [[Elvis Presley]] played afternoon and evening shows, with 18,700 and 18,698 paid admissions. He returned for two more sold-out shows on May 11, 1974, with 18,500 paid admissions each. [[The Osmonds]] performed two shows on December 4, 1971, which were recorded and released as ''[[The Osmonds Live]]''.\n\n[[Barbra Streisand]] performed on April 15, 1972, during a fundraiser for [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|George McGovern's presidential campaign]]. Although ticket prices ranged from $5.50 to $100 and the event grossed $300,000, after expenses were deducted McGovern's campaign received only $18,000. During her set, Streisand asked the audience to choose between \"Second Hand Rose\" and \"[[Stoney End (song)|Stoney End]]\" for her next song; the latter was the overwhelming choice. Her performance was recorded and released as ''[[Live Concert at the Forum]]''.<ref name=\"spada-legend\">{{cite book|title=Streisand: The Woman and the Legend|last1=Spada|first1=James|last2=Nickens|first2=Christopher|year=1981|publisher=Dolphin Books, an imprint of [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=0-385-17567-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/streisandwoman00spad/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/streisandwoman00spad/page/149}}</ref>\n\n[[Bob Dylan]]'s live album ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before the Flood]]'' with [[The Band]] was compiled from songs performed at the Forum over the course of three shows on February 13 and 14, 1974. The only song on the album not recorded at the Forum was \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]\", which was recorded in New York City.\n\n[[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] played five sold-out shows in a seven-day stretch in 1975, here at The Forum. The dates were February 3+4, 8-10.\n\n[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] had their debut there in 1976 on February 23 for two consecutive nights, three days after getting their footprints outside [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] and played three more shows the following year, 1977, on August 26\u201328, with live tracks from these 1977 shows included on their second live album, ''[[Alive II]]'', released in October of that same year.\n\nOn June 21, 1976, [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]] began a three-night stand at the Forum during their [[Wings Over the World tour]]. The shows were McCartney's first live performances in Los Angeles since he played at the Hollywood Bowl in 1964 and 1965 with [[the Beatles]]. Some songs played at the Forum appeared on the ''[[Wings Over America]]'' live LP released later that year and re-released in 2013.\n\nThe [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] performed three shows during their ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' tour on October 20\u201322, 1976. The shows were recorded, with some songs appearing on ''[[Eagles Live]]''.\n\nThe [[Bee Gees]] appeared at the Forum during their ''[[Children of the World]]'' tour on December 20, 1976; the show was recorded and released as ''[[Here at Last...

The team was owned by Los Angeles businessman [[Jerry Buss]].\n\nIn 1979, Cooke sold the Forum, the Lakers and the Kings to Buss for a then-record $67.5&nbsp;million.\n\n===1980s===\nThe Lakers were successful during the 1980s, winning five NBA championships and making the [[NBA Finals]] every year except [[1981 NBA Playoffs|1981]] and [[1986 NBA Playoffs|1986]]. They won the {{nbafy|1982}}, {{nbafy|1987}} and {{nbafy|1988}} championships at the Forum. The [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]] were the only visiting teams to win a championship at the Forum during this period; both teams clinched the title in a Game 4 sweep in {{nbafy|1983}} and {{nbafy|1989}} respectively.\n\nThe Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss, also purchased the [[Los Angeles Strings]] expansion franchise of the second incarnation of TeamTennis (the original team and league having folded in 1978) and appointed his 19-year-old daughter [[Jeanie Buss]] as the tennis team's general manager, with all home matches played at the Forum.\n\nIn 1981, [[Diana Ross]] filmed the concert portion of her ''Diana'' television special at the Forum, entering the arena through the audience and singing her 1980 Billboard top-five hit \"[[I'm Coming Out]]\". Guests included [[Quincy Jones]] (who conducted a performance of \"Home\" from ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'') and [[Michael Jackson]], who joined Ross onstage for a performance of her 1980 number-one song \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\". The special began with Ross in a photo session atop the Forum in a silver [[Lam\u00e9 (fabric)|lam\u00e9]] bodysuit with large, silver-lam\u00e9 wings.\n\nOn December 10, 1981, [[Devo]] performed at the Forum during their [[New Traditionalists]] tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/devo/1981/the-forum-inglewood-ca-2bdffcd6.html|title=DEVO Setlist at The Forum, Inglewood|website=setlist.fm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://huboon.com/devo811210.html|title=Devo Live Guide - 12/10/81 - The Forum, Englewood, CA|website=huboon.com}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1982, the Forum was the site of the \"[[Miracle on Manchester]]\", in which the Kings overcame a 5\u20130 deficit in a first-round [[Stanley Cup]] playoff game against the [[Edmonton Oilers]] to win 6\u20135 in overtime. With additional upset wins in Games 1 and 5 of the five-game series, the Kings eliminated the heavily favored Oilers to reach the second round.\n\nIn September 1982, on their [[Hot Space Tour]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] played their final U.S. concert ever at The Forum.\n\n[[Fleetwood Mac]] played two shows during its ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'' tour on October 21\u201322, 1982, with [[Dave Mason]] opening.

The original scoreboard, designed by All American Scoreboards in [[Pardeeville, Wisconsin]], had a two-line message board on each side (the third electronic message board in the NHL, and the second in the NBA). The new scoreboard, designed by [[Daktronics]], kept the two-line message boards and added a [[Sony]] [[Jumbotron]] scoreboard on each side. However, by the middle of the decade the Great Western Forum was considered too small; it lacked [[luxury box]]es and had insufficient retail and commercial space. Los Angeles officials, seeking to redevelop the city center, began planning a new downtown sports arena and entertainment complex and hoped to attract the Lakers and Kings from Inglewood.\n\nThe Kings' owners, who were real-estate developers, agreed to develop the complex (which became [[Staples Center]]); Buss agreed to move the Lakers into the new arena as co-tenants with the Kings and a third tenant, the NBA's [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]], who would move there from the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]. The new arena opened on October 17, 1999; as part of the deal, Buss sold the Great Western Forum to the L. A. Arena Company (which was controlled by the Kings' owners).\n\nGuns N' Roses with Skid Row played four sold-out shows during the Use Your Illusion Tour on July 29, July 30, August 2, and August 3, 1991.\n\nThe Forum hosted the [[1991 NBA Finals]] and was the site of the [[Chicago Bulls]]' first NBA championship victory. It also hosted Games 3 and 4 of the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the Kings and [[Montreal Canadiens]], the only time the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] was held at the arena. Coincidentally, Montreal's home rink at the time was also called [[Montreal Forum|the Forum]].\n\n==={{anchor|Last Games}}Final games===\nOn April 18, 1999, the Kings played their final regular-season NHL game at the Forum, a 3\u20132 loss to the [[St. Louis Blues]], on the day that former King and Blue [[Wayne Gretzky]] played his final NHL game as a [[New York Rangers|New York Ranger]]; their last game altogether at the Fabulous Forum was an 8\u20131 preseason win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on September 20 of that year. Staples Center was still under construction, so the Kings played their remaining preseason home games at the [[Pechanga Arena|San Diego Sports Arena]] and the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]]. The Lakers' 118\u2013107 playoff loss to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] on May 23, 1999 was their last regular or postseason game played at the Forum; they played two preseason games there the following year before they moved to Staples Center.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Lakers|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html|publisher=Los Angeles Lakers|accessdate=July 17, 2010|quote=The arrival of Shaquille O'Neal necessitated the trading of longtime center Vlade Divac, and the trading or renouncement of several other veterans}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe [[Los Angeles Sparks]] played their 2000 season at the arena before following the Lakers and Clippers to Staples Center.

It was owned by the church's for-profit entity, Forum Enterprises, which accommodated secular and pop-music artists. The church influenced the approval of performers, however; in 2005 and 2009 the Forum refused to allow performances by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], whose former name was Burn the Priest.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn February 14, 2003, [[Phish]] began their first post-hiatus tour at the Forum.

Or is this just a random number? Was the exterior repaired?}}\n\nThe Forum was made available for film use, including interior shots for the 2002 film ''[[Like Mike]]''. The [[Foo Fighters]] used the building as a setting for the music video for \"[[All My Life (Foo Fighters song)|All My Life]]\" in 2003, featuring the building's exterior in its opening and closing shots. In 2008, a scene for the 2009 film ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' and the video for [[Weezer]]'s \"[[Troublemaker (Weezer song)|Troublemaker]]\" (from their 2008 ''[[Weezer (2008 album)|Red Album]]'') were filmed outside the Forum.\n\n[[Iron Maiden]] appeared during their [[Somewhere Back in Time World Tour]] on February 19, 2008, with [[Lauren Harris]] their opening act. Their live version of \"[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]\" was included on the documentary ''[[Iron Maiden: Flight 666]]''.\n\nIn May and June 2009, Michael Jackson rehearsed at the Forum for his [[This Is It (concerts)|This Is It]] concert series in London. After Jackson died on [[Death of Michael Jackson|June 25, 2009]], footage of these rehearsals and those at Staples Center became part of ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''.\n\nOn October 9, 2009, the Lakers returned to the Forum for a preseason game against the [[Golden State Warriors]] to celebrate the team's 50th season in Los Angeles; the Lakers lost, 110\u201391.\n\n==={{anchor|2010s: Reopening}}2010s: MSG era===\nIn 2011, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] began a 21-show run at the Forum.<ref name=\"Prince-RS\">{{cite news | last = Edwards | first = Gavin | title = Prince Kicks Off 21-Concert Residency With Epic Three-Hour Show | work = Rolling Stone | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/prince-kicks-off-21-show-l-a-residency-with-epic-three-hour-show-20110415 | date = April 15, 2011 | accessdate = October 22, 2015}}</ref> After acquiring the arena in June 2012, [[the Madison Square Garden Company]] announced plans for a $50&nbsp;million renovation.<ref>{{cite press release |title=The Madison Square Garden Company Acquires Famed Forum Arena |url=http://investor.msg.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=686581 |location=New York City |publisher=[[The Madison Square Garden Company]] |agency=[[GlobeNewswire]] |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517151813/http://investor.msg.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=686581 |archivedate=May 17, 2014  }}</ref> The City of Inglewood made an $18&nbsp;million commercial-rehabilitation loan, contingent on MSG's $50&nbsp;million investment.<ref name=\"Vincent\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/07/heres_what_the_revamped_inglewood_forum_will_look_like.php |title=Here's What the Revamped Inglewood Forum Will Look Like |last1=Bachrach |first1=Eve |date=July 30, 2013 |website=[[Curbed|Curbed Los Angeles]] |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref> The arena was renamed \"The Forum, presented by Chase\" to reflect its sponsor, [[Chase (bank)|Chase Bank]] (which had incidentally purchased Great Western's legal successor, Washington Mutual, a few years earlier<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbanklocations.com/great-western-bank-a-fsb-29602.shtml|title=Great Western Bank, A FSB|website=www.usbanklocations.com}}</ref>), and its exterior returned to the original red.

Located between West [[Manchester Boulevard]], across [[Laffit Pincay, Jr.|Pincay Drive]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Kareem Court]], it is north of the under-construction [[SoFi Stadium]] and the [[Hollywood Park Casino]]. It is about {{convert|3|mi}} east of [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX). Opening on December 30, 1967, the Forum was an unusual and groundbreaking structure. Architect Charles Luckman's vision was brought to life by engineers Carl Johnson and [[Svend Nielsen (architect and engineer)|Svend Nielsen]], who were able to engineer the structure so that it had no major support pillars. This had previously been unheard of in an indoor arena the size of the Forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pe/obituary.aspx?pid=165203056 |title=Svend Nielsen Obituary - Riverside, CA &#124; The Press-Enterprise |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe arena is visible on the landing approach to the [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] from the east. With [[Madison Square Garden]], it was once one of the best-known indoor sports venues in the U.S. The Forum achieved its greatest fame as home to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[Los Angeles Kings]] of the [[National Hockey League]] from 1967 to 1999, when the teams moved to [[Staples Center]] to join the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] (who moved to Staples Center from the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]). The Forum was also the home of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]'s [[Los Angeles Sparks]] from 1997 to their 2001 move to [[Staples Center]].\n\nThe Forum was the site of the [[1972 NBA All-Star Game|1972]] and [[1983 NBA All-Star Game]]s, the [[33rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1981 NHL All-Star Game]], 1984 [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball]] and hosted the [[Big West Conference]] (from 1983 to 1988) and the 1989 [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10 Conference]] men's basketball tournaments. It was acquired in 2000 by the Faithful Central Bible Church, which used it for occasional [[church service]]s and leased it for sporting events, concerts and other events. In 2012, the Forum was purchased by the [[Madison Square Garden Company]] (MSG), owners of New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]], for $23.5&nbsp;million; MSG announced plans to renovate the arena as a world-class concert venue.<ref name=\"Vincent\">{{cite news |title=Forum Owners Plan to Revive Venue with $50-Million Renovation|first=Roger|last=Vincent|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/26/business/la-fi-forum-20120626|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 26, 2012|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref> On September 24, 2014, the Forum was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe arena is formally known as '''The Forum Presented by Chase''',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/las-forum-get-765-million-595536 |title=L.A.'s The Forum to Get $76.5 Million Makeover and Reopen With Eagles Concerts |last1=Bond |first1=Paul |date=July 30, 2013 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref> and has previously been known as the '''Great Western Forum'''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/07/business/the-media-business-great-western-s-name-on-los-angeles-forum.html |title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Great Western's Name On Los Angeles Forum|last1=Adelson |first1=Andrea |date=December 7, 1988 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}</ref> and nicknamed the \"Fabulous Forum\" by Lakers announcer [[Chick Hearn]].<ref name=\"Ballmer\" /> It is also known informally as the '''L.A.

The arena seats 17,505 for basketball, 16,005 for hockey and up to 18,000 for musical concerts; although it has no luxury suites, it had 2,400 [[Club seating|club seats]] for events. More than 70% of the seats are between the goals, and no seat is more than {{convert|170|ft}} from the playing surface.\n\nThe Forum became a landmark in [[greater Los Angeles]], largely due to the Lakers' success and the [[Hollywood]] celebrities often seen there. It hosted tennis matches, music concerts, [[boxing]] matches and U. S. political events. The arena is sometimes called the \"Los Angeles Forum\" or the \"L. A. Forum\" to distinguish it from other places with the name \"Forum\".\n\nDuring the Cooke era, the Forum hosted five NBA Finals in its first six years (1967\u201373). The [[Boston Celtics]] celebrated both the {{nbafy|1968}} and {{nbafy|1969}} championships in the arena, the latter of which marked the final games [[Bill Russell]] ever played. The Lakers won the [[1972 NBA Finals]] at the Forum in Game 5, while the [[New York Knicks]]' second and most recent championship was also clinched in a Game 5 at the same venue [[1973 NBA Finals|the following season]].\n\n[[Cream (band)|Cream]] played two shows during the band's farewell tour, on October 18\u201319, 1968, with [[Deep Purple]] the opening act. The band's show of October 19 produced the live tracks on their farewell LP, ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]''. Deep Purple also recorded their part of the show, which was later released as a live album entitled ''[[Inglewood \u2013 Live in California]]''.\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young recorded shows in June and July of 1970, including at the Forum. Some of which ended up on their 1971 live album, \u201c4 Way Street\u201d.\n\n[[The Rolling Stones]] performed at the Forum during their 1969, 1972 and 1975 North American tours. [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] played there during their ''[[At Your Birthday Party]]'' tour on July 14, 1969, with [[Three Dog Night]] the opening act. Three Dog Night recorded their set, which was later released as a live album entitled ''[[Captured Live at the Forum]]''.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1977 [[Led Zeppelin]] performed 16 times at the Forum, including a run of six sold-out dates in 1977. Part of their live album, ''[[How the West Was Won (Led Zeppelin album)|How the West Was Won]]'', was recorded at the arena. The band's first 1977 show is the source of the [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] ''[[Listen to This Eddie]]''. Another bootleg from the Forum shows, ''[[For Badgeholders Only]]'', contains one of the last live performances by [[Keith Moon]] on drums, with his surprise performance there.\n\n[[The Jackson 5]] performed twice at the Forum: on June 20, 1970, during their [[The Jackson 5 First National Tour|first national tour]] and on August 26, 1972 during their third national tour. The 1970 show broke attendance records, with 18,675 paid admissions and a gross income of $105,000 (when the Jackson 5 had released two albums and three singles). By 1972, they had released seven albums on [[Motown]], in addition to [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] and [[Jermaine Jackson]]'s solo albums. Both shows were recorded and released as ''[[Live at the Forum (The Jackson 5 album)|Live at the Forum]]''.\n\nOn November 14, 1970, [[Elvis Presley]] played afternoon and evening shows, with 18,700 and 18,698 paid admissions. He returned for two more sold-out shows on May 11, 1974, with 18,500 paid admissions each. [[The Osmonds]] performed two shows on December 4, 1971, which were recorded and released as ''[[The Osmonds Live]]''.\n\n[[Barbra Streisand]] performed on April 15, 1972, during a fundraiser for [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|George McGovern's presidential campaign]]. Although ticket prices ranged from $5.50 to $100 and the event grossed $300,000, after expenses were deducted McGovern's campaign received only $18,000. During her set, Streisand asked the audience to choose between \"Second Hand Rose\" and \"[[Stoney End (song)|Stoney End]]\" for her next song; the latter was the overwhelming choice. Her performance was recorded and released as ''[[Live Concert at the Forum]]''.<ref name=\"spada-legend\">{{cite book|title=Streisand: The Woman and the Legend|last1=Spada|first1=James|last2=Nickens|first2=Christopher|year=1981|publisher=Dolphin Books, an imprint of [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=0-385-17567-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/streisandwoman00spad/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/streisandwoman00spad/page/149}}</ref>\n\n[[Bob Dylan]]'s live album ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before the Flood]]'' with [[The Band]] was compiled from songs performed at the Forum over the course of three shows on February 13 and 14, 1974. The only song on the album not recorded at the Forum was \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]\", which was recorded in New York City.\n\n[[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] played five sold-out shows in a seven-day stretch in 1975, here at The Forum. The dates were February 3+4, 8-10.\n\n[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] had their debut there in 1976 on February 23 for two consecutive nights, three days after getting their footprints outside [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] and played three more shows the following year, 1977, on August 26\u201328, with live tracks from these 1977 shows included on their second live album, ''[[Alive II]]'', released in October of that same year.\n\nOn June 21, 1976, [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]] began a three-night stand at the Forum during their [[Wings Over the World tour]]. The shows were McCartney's first live performances in Los Angeles since he played at the Hollywood Bowl in 1964 and 1965 with [[the Beatles]]. Some songs played at the Forum appeared on the ''[[Wings Over America]]'' live LP released later that year and re-released in 2013.\n\nThe [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] performed three shows during their ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' tour on October 20\u201322, 1976. The shows were recorded, with some songs appearing on ''[[Eagles Live]]''.\n\nThe [[Bee Gees]] appeared at the Forum during their ''[[Children of the World]]'' tour on December 20, 1976; the show was recorded and released as ''[[Here at Last... Bee Gees...

The team was owned by Los Angeles businessman [[Jerry Buss]].\n\nIn 1979, Cooke sold the Forum, the Lakers and the Kings to Buss for a then-record $67.5&nbsp;million.\n\n===1980s===\nThe Lakers were successful during the 1980s, winning five NBA championships and making the [[NBA Finals]] every year except [[1981 NBA Playoffs|1981]] and [[1986 NBA Playoffs|1986]]. They won the {{nbafy|1982}}, {{nbafy|1987}} and {{nbafy|1988}} championships at the Forum. The [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]] were the only visiting teams to win a championship at the Forum during this period; both teams clinched the title in a Game 4 sweep in {{nbafy|1983}} and {{nbafy|1989}} respectively.\n\nThe Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss, also purchased the [[Los Angeles Strings]] expansion franchise of the second incarnation of TeamTennis (the original team and league having folded in 1978) and appointed his 19-year-old daughter [[Jeanie Buss]] as the tennis team's general manager, with all home matches played at the Forum.\n\nIn 1981, [[Diana Ross]] filmed the concert portion of her ''Diana'' television special at the Forum, entering the arena through the audience and singing her 1980 Billboard top-five hit \"[[I'm Coming Out]]\". Guests included [[Quincy Jones]] (who conducted a performance of \"Home\" from ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'') and [[Michael Jackson]], who joined Ross onstage for a performance of her 1980 number-one song \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\". The special began with Ross in a photo session atop the Forum in a silver [[Lam\u00e9 (fabric)|lam\u00e9]] bodysuit with large, silver-lam\u00e9 wings.\n\nOn December 10, 1981, [[Devo]] performed at the Forum during their [[New Traditionalists]] tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/devo/1981/the-forum-inglewood-ca-2bdffcd6.html|title=DEVO Setlist at The Forum, Inglewood|website=setlist.fm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://huboon.com/devo811210.html|title=Devo Live Guide - 12/10/81 - The Forum, Englewood, CA|website=huboon.com}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1982, the Forum was the site of the \"[[Miracle on Manchester]]\", in which the Kings overcame a 5\u20130 deficit in a first-round [[Stanley Cup]] playoff game against the [[Edmonton Oilers]] to win 6\u20135 in overtime. With additional upset wins in Games 1 and 5 of the five-game series, the Kings eliminated the heavily favored Oilers to reach the second round.\n\nIn September 1982, on their [[Hot Space Tour]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] played their final U.S. concert ever at The Forum.\n\n[[Fleetwood Mac]] played two shows during its ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'' tour on October 21\u201322, 1982, with [[Dave Mason]] opening.

The original scoreboard, designed by All American Scoreboards in [[Pardeeville, Wisconsin]], had a two-line message board on each side (the third electronic message board in the NHL, and the second in the NBA). The new scoreboard, designed by [[Daktronics]], kept the two-line message boards and added a [[Sony]] [[Jumbotron]] scoreboard on each side. However, by the middle of the decade the Great Western Forum was considered too small; it lacked [[luxury box]]es and had insufficient retail and commercial space. Los Angeles officials, seeking to redevelop the city center, began planning a new downtown sports arena and entertainment complex and hoped to attract the Lakers and Kings from Inglewood.\n\nThe Kings' owners, who were real-estate developers, agreed to develop the complex (which became [[Staples Center]]); Buss agreed to move the Lakers into the new arena as co-tenants with the Kings and a third tenant, the NBA's [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]], who would move there from the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]. The new arena opened on October 17, 1999; as part of the deal, Buss sold the Great Western Forum to the L. A. Arena Company (which was controlled by the Kings' owners).\n\nGuns N' Roses with Skid Row played four sold-out shows during the Use Your Illusion Tour on July 29, July 30, August 2, and August 3, 1991.\n\nThe Forum hosted the [[1991 NBA Finals]] and was the site of the [[Chicago Bulls]]' first NBA championship victory. It also hosted Games 3 and 4 of the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the Kings and [[Montreal Canadiens]], the only time the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] was held at the arena.
