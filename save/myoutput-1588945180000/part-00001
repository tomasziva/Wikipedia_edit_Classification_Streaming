In 1978, the game was ported to the [[Atari 2600]] and a sequel was made, ''[[Super Breakout]]'', which four years later became the \"pack-in game\" for the [[Atari 5200]] console. ''Breakout'' spawned an entire genre of [[Breakout clone|''Breakout'' clones]], and the concept found new legs with [[Taito|Taito's]] 1986 ''[[Arkanoid]]'', which itself spawned dozens of imitators.\n\nIn ''Breakout'', a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all. A ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen; to prevent this from happening, the player has a horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Breakout game screenshot.png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot]]\n''Breakout'' begins with eight rows of bricks, with each two rows a different color. The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to ricochet the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn. The player has three turns to try to clear two screens of bricks. Yellow bricks earn one point each, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points and the top-level red bricks score seven points each. The paddle shrinks to one-half its size after the ball has broken through the red row and hit the upper wall. Ball speed increases at specific intervals: after four hits, after twelve hits, and after making contact with the orange and red rows.\n\nThe highest score achievable for one player is 896; this is done by eliminating two screens of bricks worth 448 points per screen. Once the second screen of bricks is destroyed, the ball in play harmlessly bounces off empty walls until the player restarts the game, as no additional screens are provided.  However, a secret way to score beyond the 896 maximum is to play the game in two-player mode. If \"Player One\" completes the first screen on their third and last ball, then immediately and deliberately allows the ball to \"drain\", Player One's second screen is transferred to \"Player Two\" as a third screen, allowing Player Two to score a maximum of 1,344 points if they are adept enough to keep the third ball in play that long. Once the third screen is eliminated, the game is over.\n\nThe original arcade cabinet of Breakout featured artwork that revealed the game's plot to be that of a [[prison escape]]. According to this release, the player is actually playing as one of a prison's inmates attempting to knock a [[ball and chain]] into a wall of their prison cell with a mallet. If the player successfully destroys the wall in-game, their inmate escapes with others following.\n\n==History and development==\n''Breakout'', a [[Logic gate|discrete logic]] (non-[[microprocessor]]) game, was designed by Nolan Bushnell, Steve Wozniak, and Steve Bristow, all three of whom were involved with Atari and its [[Kee Games]] subsidiary. Atari produced innovative video games using the ''Pong'' hardware as a means of competition against companies making \"''Pong'' clones\".<ref name=\"UHoVG\">{{cite book| title = Ultimate History of Video Games| first = Steven| last = Kent| publisher = Three Rivers Press| isbn = 0-7615-3643-4| year = 2001}}</ref> Bushnell wanted to turn ''Pong'' into a single player game, where the player would use a paddle to maintain a ball that depletes a wall of bricks. Bushnell was certain the game would be popular, and he and Bristow partnered to produce a concept. [[Al Alcorn]] was assigned as the ''Breakout'' project manager, and began development with [[Cyan Engineering]] in 1975. Bushnell assigned [[Steve Jobs]] to design a prototype. Jobs was offered [[United States dollar|$]]0, with an award for every TTL ([[transistor-transistor logic]]) chip fewer than 50. Jobs promised to complete a prototype within four days.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Steve Jobs\n| last = Isaacson | first = Walter\n| authorlink = Walter Isaacson\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/166 166]\n| publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]]\n| year = 2011\n| isbn = 978-1-4516-4853-9\n| title-link = Steve Jobs (book) }}</ref>\n\nBushnell offered the bonus because he disliked how new Atari games required 150 to 170 chips; he knew that Jobs' friend [[Steve Wozniak]], an employee of [[Hewlett-Packard]], had designed a version of Pong that used about 30 chips.{{r|wozniak198412}} Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design but knew Wozniak was capable of producing designs with a small number of chips. He convinced Wozniak to work with him, promising to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak had no sketches and instead interpreted the game from its description. To save parts, he had \"tricky little designs\" difficult to understand for most engineers. Near the end of development, Wozniak considered moving the [[high score]] to the screen's top, but Jobs claimed Bushnell wanted it at the bottom; Wozniak was unaware of any truth to his claims. The original deadline was met after Wozniak worked at Atari four nights straight, doing some additional designs while at his day job at Hewlett-Packard.  This equated to a bonus of $5,000, which Jobs kept secret from Wozniak.

Brad Stewart and [[Ian Shepherd]] were both available to program ''Breakout'' for the 2600 and competed in the original version of ''Breakout'' for the programming rights; Brad won.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The game was published in 1978, but with only six rows of bricks, and the player is given five turns to clear two walls instead of three. In the Breakthru variant, the ball does not bounce off of the bricks, but continues through them until it hits the wall. [[Atari]] had this term [[trademarked]] and used it in addition to ''Breakout'' to describe gameplay, especially in look-alike games and remakes.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAtari's 1977 dedicated [[Video Pinball]] console includes a ''Breakout'' game.\n\n==Apple II influence==\n''Breakout'' directly influenced Wozniak's design for the [[Apple II]] computer.

Wozniak found the gameplay to be the same as his original creation, and could not find any differences.<ref name=\"iWoz\"/><ref name=\"UHVF\"/><ref name=\"DotEaters\"/><ref name=\"ArcadeHistory\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/1970s/o.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017131038/http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/1970s/o.htm|archivedate=2007-10-17|accessdate=2016-06-20|title=Phosphor-Dot Fossils: Breakout}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1460/woz_was_here__steve_wozniak_on_.php |title=Features - Woz Was Here - Steve Wozniak On His Gaming Past |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}</ref>\n\nThe [[arcade cabinet]] uses a black and white [[Computer display|monitor]]. However, the monitor has strips of colored [[cellophane]] placed over it so that the bricks appear to be in color.\n\n==Ports==\n[[Image:Breakout2600.svg|240px|thumb|Atari 2600 version]]\n\nThe not so original arcade version of ''Breakout'' was ported to the [[Atari 2600]] by Brad Stewart. Brad Stewart and [[Ian Shepherd]] were both available to program ''Breakout'' for the 2600 and competed in the original version of ''Breakout'' for the programming rights; Brad won.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The game was published in 1978, but with only six rows of bricks, and the player is given five turns to clear two walls instead of three. In the Breakthru variant, the ball does not bounce off of the bricks, but continues through them until it hits the wall. [[Atari]] had this term [[trademarked]] and used it in addition to ''Breakout'' to describe gameplay, especially in look-alike games and remakes.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAtari's 1977 dedicated [[Video Pinball]] console includes a ''Breakout'' game.\n\n==Apple II influence==\n''Breakout'' directly influenced Wozniak's design for the [[Apple II]] computer. He said, \"A lot of features of the Apple II went in because I had designed ''Breakout'' for Atari. I had designed it in hardware. I wanted to write it in software now.\"<ref>Connick, Jack. \"...And Then There Was Apple.\" Call-A.P.P.L.E. Oct 1986: 24.</ref> This included his design of color graphics circuitry, the addition of game paddle support and sound, and graphics commands in [[Integer BASIC]], with which he wrote ''Brick Out'', a software clone of his own hardware game.<ref name=\"wozniak20140501\">{{cite web | url=https://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636 | title=How Steve Wozniak Wrote BASIC for the Original Apple From Scratch | publisher=Gizmodo | date=2014-05-01 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Wozniak, Steve}}</ref> Wozniak said in 1984:<ref name=\"wozniak198412\"/>\n\n{{quote|Basically, all the game features were put in just so I could show off the game I was familiar with\u2014''Breakout''\u2014at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]].

This [[science fiction]] story dealt with [[NASA]] astronaut Captain John Stewart Chang returning from a routine mission transporting [[titanium]] [[ore]] from [[Io (moon)|Io]] to space station New California. He encounters a rainbow barrier, presumably a force of nature, that seems to have no end on either side.  He has three lobbing missiles of white light that he can bounce off the hull of his shuttle, and they prove able to break through the layers of the force field.  With his life support systems failing, what follows is a test of endurance turned game as he strives to break through the barrier in space.<ref>Braden, John.
