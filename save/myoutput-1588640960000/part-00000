However, this ascent was temporary and he came back to Earth. It is ascribed to the exact descriptions presented in both the Quran and the [[Hadith]].\n\nIslamic texts deny the idea of crucifixion or death attributed to [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] by the New Testament.<ref>Shafaat, Dr. Ahmad, [http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm Islamic View of the Coming/Return of Jesus\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923170110/http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm |date=2015-09-23 }} article dated May 2003, at the ''Islamic Perspectives'' Web site: \"In 4:159, after denying that the Jews killed or crucified Jesus and after stating that God raised him to Himself, the Qur`an says ...\". Retrieved March 29, 2007.</ref> The [[Quran]] states that people (i.e., the Jews and Romans) sought to kill Jesus, but they could not crucify or kill him, although \"this was made to appear to them\". Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead he was raised by God unto the heavens. This \"raising\" is often understood to mean through bodily ascension.\n\nSome Islamic scholars have identified the prophet [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] to be the same person as [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] from the Bible. This is because the Qu'ran states that God \"raised him to a lofty station\", and that has been taken to be a term for ascending, upon which it is concluded that \"Idris\" was \"Enoch\".\n\nIn contrast, the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement in Islam believe that [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|Jesus]], having survived crucifixion and later living to old age, that only his rank and spiritual stature was \u2018raised\u2019 to be closer to God. The movement reject the notion of Jesus\u2019s bodily ascension into Heaven.\n\n==Judaism==\nIn the [[Hebrew Bible]], the word for \"heavens\" is ''[[Heaven in Judaism|shamayim]]''. This is plural - it means \"heavens\", not \"heaven\" - but seems nevertheless to have a singular meaning: i.e., the older parts of the bible speak of \"heavens\" in the plural and Nehemiah 9:6 says, \"... You made the heavens, even the highest heavens...\"<ref>In the Christian bible, II Corinthians 12:2 says, \"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven...\"</ref> Shamayim also meant \"sky\", the atmosphere, as it does in modern English. The blue dome of the sky was called the ''[[Firmament|raqia]]'', and was believed to be a solid shield between the atmosphere and the true heaven where God lived.{{dubious|date=December 2016}} Heaven was the realm of God, Earth of mankind, and the [[underworld]] was for the dead, and travel between them was generally impossible, although God and his messengers frequently appear on Earth and the dead can be summoned up from the underworld as the [[Witch of Endor]] summons the shade of Samuel.\n\nThere are two possible exceptions to this general rule that humans could not go to Heaven, Enoch and Elijah, but neither is clear. {{Bibleverse|Genesis|5:24|HE}} mentions [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as one who \"...walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away,\" but it does not explicitly say whether he was alive or dead, and it does not say where God took him. The [[Books of Kings]] describes the prophet [[Elijah]] being taken towards \"shamayim\" in a whirlwind, but the word can mean both Heaven as the abode of God, or the sky (as the word \"heavens\" does in modern English), and so again the text is ambiguous.\n\nAccording to the post-biblical [[Jewish]] [[Midrash]], eight people went to (or will go to) Heaven (also referred to as the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Paradise]]) alive:<ref>''Derech Eretz Zuta'' (post-Talmudic tractate) cited in: Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi and Rabbi N.

However, this ascent was temporary and he came back to Earth. It is ascribed to the exact descriptions presented in both the Quran and the [[Hadith]].\n\nIslamic texts deny the idea of crucifixion or death attributed to [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] by the New Testament.<ref>Shafaat, Dr. Ahmad, [http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm Islamic View of the Coming/Return of Jesus\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923170110/http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm |date=2015-09-23 }} article dated May 2003, at the ''Islamic Perspectives'' Web site: \"In 4:159, after denying that the Jews killed or crucified Jesus and after stating that God raised him to Himself, the Qur`an says ...\". Retrieved March 29, 2007.</ref> The [[Quran]] states that people (i.e., the Jews and Romans) sought to kill Jesus, but they could not crucify or kill him, although \"this was made to appear to them\". Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead he was raised by God unto the heavens. This \"raising\" is often understood to mean through bodily ascension.\n\nSome Islamic scholars have identified the prophet [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] to be the same person as [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] from the Bible. This is because the Qu'ran states that God \"raised him to a lofty station\", and that has been taken to be a term for ascending, upon which it is concluded that \"Idris\" was \"Enoch\".\n\nIn contrast, the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement in Islam believe that [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|Jesus]], having survived crucifixion and later living to old age, that only his rank and spiritual stature was \u2018raised\u2019 to be closer to God. The movement reject the notion of Jesus\u2019s bodily ascension into Heaven.\n\n==Judaism==\nIn the [[Hebrew Bible]], the word for \"heavens\" is ''[[Heaven in Judaism|shamayim]]''. This is plural - it means \"heavens\", not \"heaven\" - but seems nevertheless to have a singular meaning: i.e., the older parts of the bible speak of \"heavens\" in the plural and Nehemiah 9:6 says, \"... You made the heavens, even the highest heavens...\"<ref>In the Christian bible, II Corinthians 12:2 says, \"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven...\"</ref> Shamayim also meant \"sky\", the atmosphere, as it does in modern English. The blue dome of the sky was called the ''[[Firmament|raqia]]'', and was believed to be a solid shield between the atmosphere and the true heaven where God lived.{{dubious|date=December 2016}} Heaven was the realm of God, Earth of mankind, and the [[underworld]] was for the dead, and travel between them was generally impossible, although God and his messengers frequently appear on Earth and the dead can be summoned up from the underworld as the [[Witch of Endor]] summons the shade of Samuel.\n\nThere are two possible exceptions to this general rule that humans could not go to Heaven, Enoch and Elijah, but neither is clear. {{Bibleverse|Genesis|5:24|HE}} mentions [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as one who \"...walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away,\" but it does not explicitly say whether he was alive or dead, and it does not say where God took him. The [[Books of Kings]] describes the prophet [[Elijah]] being taken towards \"shamayim\" in a whirlwind, but the word can mean both Heaven as the abode of God, or the sky (as the word \"heavens\" does in modern English), and so again the text is ambiguous.\n\nAccording to the post-biblical [[Jewish]] [[Midrash]], eight people went to (or will go to) Heaven (also referred to as the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Paradise]]) alive:<ref>''Derech Eretz Zuta'' (post-Talmudic tractate) cited in: Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi and Rabbi N.

She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally handicapped. However, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda believes she has inherited great lucidity: \"It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war\", he said. She rejects clothing and beauty.
