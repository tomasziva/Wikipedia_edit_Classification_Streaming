In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the [[uterus]] to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is [[precocial]] and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is [[altricial]] and completely dependent on parenting. In [[marsupial]]s, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short [[gestation]]al period and develops further in its mother's womb's  [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]].\n\nIt is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]], with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], with the [[embryo]] developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals.\n\n==Mammals==\nLarge [[mammal]]s, such as [[primate]]s, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, some [[antelope]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[elephant]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, generally are pregnant with one offspring at a time, although they may have twin or multiple births on occasion. In these large animals, the birth process is similar to that of a human, though in most the offspring is [[precocial]]. This means that it is born in a more advanced state than a human baby and is able to stand, walk and run (or swim in the case of an aquatic mammal) shortly after birth.<ref name=Dorit/> In the case of whales, dolphins and porpoises, the single calf is normally born tail first which minimizes the risk of drowning.<ref>Mark Simmonds, ''Whales and Dolphins of the World'', New Holland Publishers (2007), Ch. 1, p. 32 {{ISBN|1845378202}}.</ref>  The mother encourages the newborn calf to rise to the surface of the water to breathe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humpbackwhale.homestead.com/Humpback-Whale-Calf.html |title=Humpback Whale Calves |author=Crockett, Gary |year=2011 |publisher=Humpback whales Australia |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref>\n\nMost smaller mammals have multiple births, producing litters of young which may number twelve or more.

The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the [[uterus]] and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4&nbsp;cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a [[breech birth]]) of the baby is pushed against the [[cervix]], which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10&nbsp;cm diameter.  At some time, the [[amniotic sac]] bursts and the [[amniotic fluid]] escapes (also known as [[rupture of membranes]] or breaking the water).<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.6, ''Normal labour: first stage''</ref> In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the [[vagina]], which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with [[umbilical cord]] attached.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.7, ''Normal labour: second stage''</ref> In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the [[placenta]], amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.8, ''Normal labour: third stage''</ref>\n\nEnormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable [[breathing]] in air. In the uterus, the [[unborn baby]] is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], which is a hole in the septum dividing the [[right atrium]] and [[left atrium]]. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the [[right ventricle]] starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the [[left atrium]], which is pumped into the [[left ventricle]], and then pumped into the main arterial system.  As a result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The [[umbilical vein]], [[umbilical arteries]], [[ductus venosus]] and [[ductus arteriosus]] are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Human Body Book |page=215 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-8561-3007-3 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |author1=Houston, Rob (editor) |author2=Lea, Maxine (art editor)}}</ref>\n\n===Cattle===\n[[File:Cow giving birth, in Laos (step by step).jpg|thumb|alt=Series of photos showing a cow giving birth|A cow giving birth]]\nBirthing in [[cattle]] is typical of a larger mammal. A [[cow]] goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd.  Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother's body prepares for birth. The contractions of the [[uterus]] are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow's [[cervix]] gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the [[amniotic sac]] through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf's front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the calf's tail and rear end in a posterior presentation).<ref name=Alberta/>  During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the [[placenta]], which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] cow.<ref name=Alberta>{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3451 |title=Calving |date=2000-02-01 |publisher=Alberta: Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref><ref name=ohio>{{cite web |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/vme-fact/pdf/0029.pdf |title=Calving Management in Dairy Herds: Timing of Intervention and Stillbirth|year=2012 |publisher=The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine Extension |accessdate=2013-12-17}}</ref>\n\n===Dogs===\n{{further|Canine reproduction#Gestation and litters}}\nBirth is termed whelping in dogs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kustritz, M.|year=2005|title=Reproductive behaviour of small animals|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/263302746/Conducta-Reproductiva-en-Pequenos-Animales|journal=Theriogenology|volume=64 |issue=3|pages=734\u2013746|via=|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.05.022|pmid=15946732}}</ref> Among [[dog]]s, as whelping approaches, contractions become more frequent.

After further contractions, the sac is expelled and the bitch breaks the membranes releasing clear fluid and exposing the puppy. The mother chews at the umbilical cord and licks the puppy vigorously, which stimulates it to breathe. If the puppy has not taken its first breath within about six minutes, it is likely to die.  Further puppies follow in a similar way one by one usually with less straining than the first usually at 15-60min intervals.

In aquatic organisms, fertilization is nearly always external with sperm and eggs being liberated into the water (an exception is sharks and rays, which have internal fertilization<ref>Sea World, [http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&-rays/reproduction.htm Sharks & Rays]; accessed 2013.09.09.</ref>). Millions of eggs may be produced with no further parental involvement, in the expectation that a small number may survive to become mature individuals. Terrestrial invertebrates may also produce large numbers of eggs, a few of which may avoid predation and carry on the species. Some fish, reptiles, and amphibians have adopted a different strategy and invest their effort in producing a small number of young at a more advanced stage which are more likely to survive to adulthood. Birds care for their young in the nest and provide for their needs after hatching and it is perhaps unsurprising that internal development does not occur in birds, given their need to fly.<ref name=Attenborough>{{cite book |title=The Trials of Life |last=Attenborough |first=David |year=1990 |isbn=9780002199124 |pages=26\u201330 }}</ref>\n\n[[Ovoviviparity]] is a mode of reproduction in which [[embryo]]s develop inside [[egg (biology)|egg]]s that remain in the mother's body until they are ready to hatch.

The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the [[uterus]] and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4&nbsp;cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a [[breech birth]]) of the baby is pushed against the [[cervix]], which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10&nbsp;cm diameter.  At some time, the [[amniotic sac]] bursts and the [[amniotic fluid]] escapes (also known as [[rupture of membranes]] or breaking the water).<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.6, ''Normal labour: first stage''</ref> In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the [[vagina]], which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with [[umbilical cord]] attached.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.7, ''Normal labour: second stage''</ref> In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the [[placenta]], amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.<ref>NICE (2007). Section 1.8, ''Normal labour: third stage''</ref>\n\nEnormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable [[breathing]] in air. In the uterus, the [[unborn baby]] is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], which is a hole in the septum dividing the [[right atrium]] and [[left atrium]]. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the [[right ventricle]] starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the [[left atrium]], which is pumped into the [[left ventricle]], and then pumped into the main arterial system.  As a result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The [[umbilical vein]], [[umbilical arteries]], [[ductus venosus]] and [[ductus arteriosus]] are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Human Body Book |page=215 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-8561-3007-3 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |author1=Houston, Rob (editor) |author2=Lea, Maxine (art editor)}}</ref>\n\n===Cattle===\n[[File:Cow giving birth, in Laos (step by step).jpg|thumb|alt=Series of photos showing a cow giving birth|A cow giving birth]]\nBirthing in [[cattle]] is typical of a larger mammal. A [[cow]] goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd.  Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother's body prepares for birth. The contractions of the [[uterus]] are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow's [[cervix]] gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the [[amniotic sac]] through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf's front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the calf's tail and rear end in a posterior presentation).<ref name=Alberta/>  During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the [[placenta]], which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] cow.<ref name=Alberta>{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3451 |title=Calving |date=2000-02-01 |publisher=Alberta: Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref><ref name=ohio>{{cite web |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/vme-fact/pdf/0029.pdf |title=Calving Management in Dairy Herds: Timing of Intervention and Stillbirth|year=2012 |publisher=The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine Extension |accessdate=2013-12-17}}</ref>\n\n===Dogs===\n{{further|Canine reproduction#Gestation and litters}}\nBirth is termed whelping in dogs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kustritz, M.|year=2005|title=Reproductive behaviour of small animals|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/263302746/Conducta-Reproductiva-en-Pequenos-Animales|journal=Theriogenology|volume=64 |issue=3|pages=734\u2013746|via=|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.05.022|pmid=15946732}}</ref> Among [[dog]]s, as whelping approaches, contractions become more frequent. Labour in the bitch can be divided into 3 stages. The first stage is when the cervix dilates, this causes discomfort and restlessness in the bitch. Common signs of this stage are panting, fasting, and/or vomiting. This may last up to 12hrs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Stage two is the passage of the offspring.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[amniotic sac]] looking like a glistening grey balloon, with a puppy inside, is propelled through the [[vulva]].  After further contractions, the sac is expelled and the bitch breaks the membranes releasing clear fluid and exposing the puppy. The mother chews at the umbilical cord and licks the puppy vigorously, which stimulates it to breathe. If the puppy has not taken its first breath within about six minutes, it is likely to die.  Further puppies follow in a similar way one by one usually with less straining than the first usually at 15-60min intervals. If a pup has not been passed in 2 hrs a veterinarian should be contacted.<ref name=\":0\" /> Stage three is the passing of the placentas.

In aquatic organisms, fertilization is nearly always external with sperm and eggs being liberated into the water (an exception is sharks and rays, which have internal fertilization<ref>Sea World, [http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&-rays/reproduction.htm Sharks & Rays]; accessed 2013.09.09.</ref>). Millions of eggs may be produced with no further parental involvement, in the expectation that a small number may survive to become mature individuals. Terrestrial invertebrates may also produce large numbers of eggs, a few of which may avoid predation and carry on the species. Some fish, reptiles and amphibians have adopted a different strategy and invest their effort in producing a small number of young at a more advanced stage which are more likely to survive to adulthood. Birds care for their young in the nest and provide for their needs after hatching and it is perhaps unsurprising that internal development does not occur in birds, given their need to fly.<ref name=Attenborough>{{cite book |title=The Trials of Life |last=Attenborough |first=David |year=1990 |isbn=9780002199124 |pages=26\u201330 }}</ref>\n\n[[Ovoviviparity]] is a mode of reproduction in which [[embryo]]s develop inside [[egg (biology)|egg]]s that remain in the mother's body until they are ready to hatch.
