Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her.

Maeve fights Dolores to retrieve the key for Serac and Dolores' body is disabled. Maeve takes her to Serac, where she is connected to Rehoboam. Serac has her memories deleted when she refuses to give Serac the host data. Dolores' memories begin deleting quickly and in her last moments, she inspires Maeve to turn against Serac and wounds him in a gunfight as well as killing his men. Rehoboam is deleted by Caleb, now with full control, and he and Maeve leave Incite. Bernard survives the fight with William, but Ashley is shot. He is given an address and a package by the Lawrence host, who has been recruited by Dolores. The address leads Bernard to the home of Arnold's widow where the two bond over Charlie's death. He realises that Dolores gave him the key to the Sublime because Rehoboam has been delaying the collapse of society, not preventing it. He enters the Sublime to find answers on how to rebuild. In a post-credit scene, William is killed by his host with the help of Charlotte.\n |LineColor       = FAD7BB\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Double-Helix-Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Helix Bridge]] in [[Singapore]] was used for some shots in Season 3.]]\nA third season of the series was announced in May 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/westworld-renewed-season-3-hbo-1202794092/ |title='Westworld' Renewed for Season 3 at HBO |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Joe |last=Otterson |date=May 1, 2018 |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref> Production began in 2019.<ref name=\"Waithe\"/> Parts of filming took place in downtown [[Los Angeles]] and [[Singapore]] during June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/hbo-westworld-los-angeles-filming-june-2019-68345/ |title=L.A.

Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her.
