In October, 1999, the school moved to the [[Neihu District]] of Taipei; in the next year, the [[Tri-Service General Hospital]], the affiliated hospital, also moved to Neihu, where they were renamed collectively as the National Defense Medical Center.\n\n== Educational Systems ==\n\n=== Graduate Institutes ===\n\n==== Doctorate Program ====\n*Institute of Medical Sciences\n*[http://www.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/lifesci/webpage/index.htm Institute of Life Science] (formed by NDMC, [[Academia Sinica]], and [http://www.nhri.org.tw/index/home11.html NHRI])\n\n==== Master Program ====\n*Inst. of Dental Sciences\n*Inst. of Pharmaceutical Sciences\n*Inst. of Nursing\n*Inst. of Public Health\n*Inst. of Biology & anatomy\n*Inst. of Physiology\n*Inst. of Microbiology & Immunology\n*Inst. of Pathology & Parasitology \n*Inst. of Biochemistry\n*Inst. of Pharmacology\n*Inst. of Aerospace Medicine\n*Inst. of Undersea Medicine\n\n[[File:Kok-h\u00f4ng I-ha\u030dk-\u012b\u207f 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|National Defense Medical Center in 2010]]\n\n=== Undergraduate Program ===\n*[http://www.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/sm/default.htm School of Medicine]\n*[http://www.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/pharmacy/index.htm School of Pharmacy]\n*[http://www.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/dental/index.htm School of Dentistry]\n*[http://www.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/nursing/index.htm School of Nursing]\n*[http://www.ndmctsgh.edu.tw/ph/index.htm School of Public Health]\n\n== Presidents ==\n# [[Lieutenant General|LTG]] [[Robert Kho-Seng Lim]] (\u6797\u53ef\u52dd) (1947\u20131953)\n# LTG [[Chih-Teh Loo]] (\u76e7\u81f4\u5fb7) (1953\u20131975)\n# LTG [[Chok-Yung Chai]] (\u8521\u4f5c\u96cd) (M47) (1975\u20131984)\n# LTG (\u6f58\u6a39\u4eba) (M39) (1984\u20131989)\n# LTG [[T.
