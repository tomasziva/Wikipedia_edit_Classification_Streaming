Sukhrungphaa then informed the Faujdar of Sylhet that Jaintia was under his rule and that it is him that they will trade to. However, the Ahom rule in Jaintia was weak and short-lived.

[[Jaintiapur]], currently in [[Bangladesh]], was the capital.  The kingdom extended from the hills into the plains north of the [[Barak river]] {{Harvcol|Gait|1906|p=253}}. Major Henniker led the first expedition to Jaintia in 1774. The quarries in their possession were the chief supplier of lime to the delta region of Bengal, but with the British, the contact was not very smooth, and they were attacked in the same year. Subsequently, the Jaintias were increasingly isolated from the plains via a system of forts as well as via regulation of 1799 {{Harvcol|Gurdon|1914|pp=xiv-xv}}.  \n\nIn 1821, a group of Jaintias kidnapped British subjects attempting to sacrifice them to [[Kali]]. A culprit was then found by the British who admitted that it was an annual tradition which the Jaintias have been doing for 10 years. The priest would cut off the victim's throat and then the Jaintia princess would bathe in his blood. The Jaintia believed that this would bless the princess with offspring. Upon hearing this, the British threatened the Jaintia Raja that they would invade his territories if this does not stop. The Raja made an agreement in 1824 with David Scott that they will only negotiate with the British. A year later, the Jaintias attempted to continue their annual sacrifice which they had previously agreed with the British that they would stop.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], the British allowed the Jaintia king his rule north of the [[Surma River]].{{Harvcol|Gait|1906|p=284}} The Jaintias kidnapped four British men in 1832.

The ''Akhbarats'' note that the Raja had gathered 1500 infantry and began plundering the nearby region and led a siege against the fort in Sylhet. In response, the Mughals sent the general, [[Shaista Khan]], the nobleman; Iradat Khan and Raja Tahawar Singh (also known as Kunwar Tahawurr Asad) of [[Kharagpur Raj]] in [[Bihar]]. Together, they were able to defeat the Jaintia Raja and bring the kingdom back under imperial control.<ref name=\"Ansari2019\">{{cite book|author=Tahir Hussain Ansari|title=Mughal Administration and the Zamindars of Bihar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUueDwAAQBAJ|date=20 June 2019|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-00-065152-2|page=36}}</ref> \n\nIn the early 1700s, Ram Singh kidnapped the [[Kachari Kingdom|Kachari Raja]]. The Raja of Cachar then informed [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom Raja]] [[Sukhrungphaa|Rudra Singh Sukhrungphaa]] which led to the [[Ahoms]] attack through North Cachar and Jaintia Hills. Jaintia was annexed to the Ahoms and its capital city, [[Jaintiapur]], was then raided by the Ahoms and thousands of innocent civilians were put to death or ears and noses were cut off. Sukhrungphaa then informed the Faujdar of Sylhet that Jaintia was under his rule and that it is him that they will trade to. However, the Ahom rule in Jaintia was weak and short-lived. The Jaintias rebelled in their own land defeating the Ahom soldiers. Ram Singh, however, died as a captive to the Ahoms and his son, Jayo Narayan took over the Jaintia Kingdom.<ref name=allen>{{cite book|title=Assam District Gazetteers|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463814|volume=2|year=1905|location=[[Calcutta]]|author=B C Allen|publisher=[[Government of Assam]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1757, the Nongkhrem-Khairam [[Khasi people|Khasi chief]] closed the Sonapur Duar, stopping trade between the Jaintia and Ahom kingdoms. An envoy of Jaintias assembled at [[Hajo]] where they informed the incident to Ahom Raja [[Suremphaa|Suremphaa Swargadeo Rajeswar Singh]] who re-opened it for them.<ref name=allen/>\n\nThe British came into contact with the Jaintia kingdom upon receiving the ''Diwani'' of Bengal in 1765 {{Harvcol|Gurdon|1914|p=xiv}}.  [[Jaintiapur]], currently in [[Bangladesh]], was the capital.  The kingdom extended from the hills into the plains north of the [[Barak river]] {{Harvcol|Gait|1906|p=253}}. Major Henniker led the first expedition to Jaintia in 1774. The quarries in their possession were the chief supplier of lime to the delta region of Bengal, but with the British, the contact was not very smooth, and they were attacked in the same year. Subsequently, the Jaintias were increasingly isolated from the plains via a system of forts as well as via regulation of 1799 {{Harvcol|Gurdon|1914|pp=xiv-xv}}.  \n\nIn 1821, a group of Jaintias kidnapped British subjects attempting to sacrifice them to [[Kali]]. A culprit was then found by the British who admitted that it was an annual tradition which the Jaintias have been doing for 10 years. The priest would cut off the victim's throat and then the Jaintia princess would bathe in his blood. The Jaintia believed that this would bless the princess with offspring. Upon hearing this, the British threatened the Jaintia Raja that they would invade his territories if this does not stop. The Raja made an agreement in 1824 with David Scott that they will only negotiate with the British. A year later, the Jaintias attempted to continue their annual sacrifice which they had previously agreed with the British that they would stop.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], the British allowed the Jaintia king his rule north of the [[Surma River]].{{Harvcol|Gait|1906|p=284}} The Jaintias kidnapped four British men in 1832. Three were sacrificed in the Great [[Hindu temple]] in [[Kanaighat|Faljur]], with one escaping and informing the British authorities of the atrocities.<ref name=heads>{{cite book|title=Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division|chapter=Sylhet District|pages=281-326|url=https://archive.org/details/principalheadsh00unkngoog/page/n294|year=1868|location=[[Calcutta]]|author=E M Lewis|publisher=Calcutta Central Press Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India|author=[[William Wilson Hunter]]|year=1886|page=164|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company}}</ref> After the Jaintia Raja declined to find the culprits, the British finally conquered the Jaintia Kingdom and annexed on 15 March 1835 {{Harvcol|Gait|1906|p=302}}.  The king was handed over his property in Sylhet along with a monthly salary of Rs 500.  The British administered the plain areas directly and the hill region indirectly via a system of fifteen ''dolois'' and four ''sardars''.  The fifteen administrators were free to adjudicate on all but the most heinous crimes.\n\n==Rulers==\n#Urmi Rani\n#Krishak Pator (550-570)\n#Hatak (570-600)\n#Guhak (600-630)\n#Jayanta (630-660)\n#Joymalla\n#Mahabal\n#Banchatu\n#Kama Deva (1100-1120)\n===Brahmin dynasty===\n#Kedareshwar Rai (1120-1130)\n#Dhaneshwar Rai (1130-1150)\n#Kandarpa Rai (1150-1170)\n#Manik Rai (1170-1193)\n#Jayanta Rai (1193-1210)\n#Jayanti Devi\n#Bara Gossain\n===New dynasty===\n#Prabhat Ray Syiem Sutnga (1500\u20131516)\n#Majha Gosain Syiem Sutnga (1516\u20131532)\n#Burha Parbat Ray Syiem Sutnga (1532\u20131548)\n#Bar Gosain Syiem Sutnga I (1548\u20131564)\n#Bijay Manik Syiem Sutnga (1564\u20131580)\n#Pratap Ray Syiem Sutnga (1580\u20131596)\n#Dhan Manik Syiem Sutnga (1596\u20131612)\n#Jasa Manik Syiem Sutnga (1612\u20131625)\n#Sundar Ray Syiem Sutnga (1625\u20131636)\n#Chota Parbat Ray Syiem Sutnga (1636\u20131647)\n#Jasamanta Ray Syiem Sutnga (1647\u20131660)\n#Ban Singh Syiem Sutnga (1660\u20131669)\n#Pratap Singh Syiem Sutnga (1669\u20131678)\n#Lakshmi Narayan Syiem Sutnga (1678\u20131694)\n#Ram Singh Syiem Sutnga I (1694\u20131708)\n#Jay Narayan Syiem Sutnga (1708\u20131731)\n#Bar Gosain Syiem Sutnga II (1731\u20131770)\n#Chattra Singh Syiem Sutnga (1770\u20131780)\n#Yatra Narayan Syiem Sutnga (1780-1785)\n#Bijay Narayan Syiem Sutnga (1785\u20131786)\n#Lakshmi Singh Syiem Sutnga (1786-1790)\n#Ram Singh Syiem Sutnga II (1790\u20131832)\n#Rajendra Singh Syiem Sutnga (1832\u20131835)\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last = Gait\n  | first = Edward A\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = A Historyof Assam\n  | publisher = \n  | date = 1906\n  | location = Calcutta\n  | pages = \n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GvcRAAAAYAAJ\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last = Gurdon \n  | first = Philips Richards Thornhugh\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = The Khasis\n  | publisher = Macmillan & Co.\n  | date = 1914\n  | location = London\n  | pages = \n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g3wkAAAAMAAJ\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}\n[[Category:Kingdoms of Assam]]\n[[Category:History of Meghalaya]]\n[[Category:1500 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:2nd millennium in Bangladesh]]\n", "name_user": "UserNumber", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaintia_Kingdom"}
