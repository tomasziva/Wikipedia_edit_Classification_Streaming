C. Wyeth]]. He soon attracted curators [[Dorothy Miller]] and [[Holger Cahill]] and, by 1940, the Philadelphia dealer Robert Carlen and the collector [[Albert C. Barnes]].

During this period, he had solo exhibitions in commercial galleries in Philadelphia (1940, 1941) and New York (1940, 1944), and at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] (1941), and [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1942). Private collections and museums such as the [[Barnes Foundation]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the Whitney Museum of American Art, acquired his works. His paintings were featured in national surveys held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL; [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]], Pittsburgh, PA; [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; Dayton Art Institute, OH;  [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; [[Newark Museum]], Newark, NJ;  Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA. and [[Tate Gallery]], London, UK.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the catalogue for his memorial exhibition in 1947, critic [[Alain Locke]] described Pippin as \"a real and rare genius, combining folk quality with artistic maturity so uniquely as almost to defy classification.\"\n\n==Artworks==\nPippin's oeuvre includes a variety of subject matter and compositional strategies. Beginning with art that reflected his experience in the war, Pippin went on to create landscapes, portraits, history and genre paintings, and biblical scenes.  \n\nHis first oil painting,''The End of the War: Starting Home,'' 1930, depicts the cease-fire going into effect on November 11, 1918.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Stein, Judith E.,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28148136|title=I tell my heart : the art of Horace Pippin|publisher=|others=West, Cornel,, Wilson, Judith,, Hartigan, Lynda Roscoe,, Powell, Richard J., 1953-, Bockrath, Mark,, Buckley, Barbara,|year=|isbn=0-87663-785-3|location=New York, NY|pages=59|oclc=28148136}}</ref> Out of the many war-related pictures Pippin made, this is the only one that portrays a scene at which the artist could not have been present.

Reminiscent of the bucolic ''Peaceable Kingdom'' series by Quaker artist Edward Hicks, Pippin's work adds elements that contextualize the theme in his own time. Barely visible figures in the backgrounded forest reveal forces that may precede or threaten the peace rendered in the foreground. In ''The Holy Mountain I'' and ''III'', a brown silhouetted figure can be seen hanging among the trees, presumably a victim of lynching, which was a not uncommon atrocity in the segregated southern United States.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Stein, Judith E.,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28148136|title=I tell my heart : the art of Horace Pippin|publisher=|others=West, Cornel,, Wilson, Judith,, Hartigan, Lynda Roscoe,, Powell, Richard J., 1953-, Bockrath, Mark,, Buckley, Barbara,|year=|isbn=0-87663-785-3|location=New York, NY|pages=132|oclc=28148136}}</ref> Among the paintings, soldiers, airplanes, bombs, and grave markers are also visible in the forest. Pippin suggests that discord and harmony are never too far apart. He links concepts of destruction to those of peace again by signing each painting in the series with a significant date from WWI. ''The Holy Mountain I'' is marked with \"June 6\", dating to D-Day. \"Dec 7\" marks The Holy Mountain II, signifying the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lastly, The Holy Mountain III is dated \"Aug 9\", the day the United Stated dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stein, Judith E.,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28148136|title=I tell my heart : the art of Horace Pippin|publisher=|others=West, Cornel,, Wilson, Judith,, Hartigan, Lynda Roscoe,, Powell, Richard J., 1953-, Bockrath, Mark,, Buckley, Barbara,|year=|isbn=0-87663-785-3|location=New York, NY|pages=133,134|oclc=28148136}}</ref> In the foreground, it has been noted that the shepherd figure, which Pippin added among the animals also seen in Hicks' works, bears a striking resemblance to the artist himself.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nHis ''Self-portrait'' of 1941 shows him seated at the easel. His painting of ''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] Going to his Hanging'' (1942) is in the collection of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]] is part of a trilogy on the subject of the abolitionist who is sometimes credited with igniting the Civil War.<br />\n\n<!----- This is a non-free image, being used under \"fair use\" please don't increase the size or add another image of his paintings ----><center>\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Horace Pippin, John Brown Going to His Hanging.jpg|Horace Pippin, ''John Brown Going to His Hanging''\n</gallery>[[File:Lady of the Lake MET ma1982.55.1.jpg|center|thumb|''Lady of the Lake'', 1936, Oil on fabric]]<br /></center>\n\nHis portraits include a depiction of the [[contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]] singing, painted in 1941. \n\n''Mr. Prejudice,'' made at the request of an unidentified patron, is unique in Pippin's oeuvre for it's experimental composition and more overt use of iconography. The image sorts figures compositionally by race, with an African-American group on the left and white group on the right. The lower register reveals an assortment of military types. It has been suggested that the figure at center left, a soldier outfitted in an anachronistic WWI uniform, could signify Pippin himself. The black figures face forward, towards the viewer, while the white figures face left, towards the African-American group. In the painting's upper register, a white man is seen with a hammer, presumably splitting the large, golden V that surrounds him and divides the figures below. Winston Churchill coined the slogan \"V for Victory\" in the Allied campaign to end WWII. The slogan was expanded by African-American groups into the \"Double V\" campaign, which elaborated on the hope for victory abroad to include victory over discrimination and racism at home. Larger figures are shown along the edges of the picture's upper register. On the left, a brown-skinned Statue of Liberty raises her torch, lighting the way to freedom. On the right, a broad figure dressed in red holds a noose in one hand, with his gaze directed at Lady Liberty.

C. Wyeth]]. He soon attracted curators [[Dorothy Miller]] and [[Holger Cahill]] and, by 1940, the Philadelphia dealer Robert Carlen and the collector [[Albert C. Barnes]].

During this period, he had solo exhibitions in commercial galleries in Philadelphia (1940, 1941) and New York (1940, 1944), and at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] (1941), and [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1942). Private collections and museums such as the [[Barnes Foundation]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the Whitney Museum of American Art, acquired his works. His paintings were featured in national surveys held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL; [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]], Pittsburgh, PA; [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; Dayton Art Institute, OH;  [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.; [[Newark Museum]], Newark, NJ;  Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA. and [[Tate Gallery]], London, UK.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the catalogue for his memorial exhibition in 1947, critic [[Alain Locke]] described Pippin as \"a real and rare genius, combining folk quality with artistic maturity so uniquely as almost to defy classification.\"\n\n==Artworks==\nPippin's oeuvre includes a variety of subject matter and compositional strategies. Beginning with art that reflected his experience in the war, Pippin went on to create landscapes, portraits, history and genre paintings, and biblical scenes.  \n\nHis first oil painting,''The End of the War: Starting Home,'' 1930, depicts the cease-fire going into effect on November 11, 1918.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Stein, Judith E.,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28148136|title=I tell my heart : the art of Horace Pippin|publisher=|others=West, Cornel,, Wilson, Judith,, Hartigan, Lynda Roscoe,, Powell, Richard J., 1953-, Bockrath, Mark,, Buckley, Barbara,|year=|isbn=0-87663-785-3|location=New York, NY|pages=59|oclc=28148136}}</ref> Out of the many war-related pictures Pippin made, this is the only one that portrays a scene at which the artist could not have been present.

Reminiscent of the bucolic ''Peaceable Kingdom'' series by Quaker artist Edward Hicks, Pippin's work adds elements that contextualize the theme in his own time. Barely visible figures in the backgrounded forest reveal forces that may precede or threaten the peace rendered in the foreground. In ''The Holy Mountain I'' and ''III'', a brown silhouetted figure can be seen hanging among the trees, presumably a victim of lynching, which was a not uncommon atrocity in the segregated southern United States.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Stein, Judith E.,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28148136|title=I tell my heart : the art of Horace Pippin|publisher=|others=West, Cornel,, Wilson, Judith,, Hartigan, Lynda Roscoe,, Powell, Richard J., 1953-, Bockrath, Mark,, Buckley, Barbara,|year=|isbn=0-87663-785-3|location=New York, NY|pages=132|oclc=28148136}}</ref> Among the paintings, soldiers, airplanes, bombs, and grave markers are also visible in the forest. Pippin suggests that discord and harmony are never too far apart. He links concepts of destruction to those of peace again by signing each painting in the series with a significant date from WWI. ''The Holy Mountain I'' is marked with \"June 6\", dating to D-Day. \"Dec 7\" marks The Holy Mountain II, signifying the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lastly, The Holy Mountain III is dated \"Aug 9\", the day the United Stated dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stein, Judith E.,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28148136|title=I tell my heart : the art of Horace Pippin|publisher=|others=West, Cornel,, Wilson, Judith,, Hartigan, Lynda Roscoe,, Powell, Richard J., 1953-, Bockrath, Mark,, Buckley, Barbara,|year=|isbn=0-87663-785-3|location=New York, NY|pages=133,134|oclc=28148136}}</ref> In the foreground, it has been noted that the shepherd figure, which Pippin added among the animals also seen in Hicks' works, bears a striking resemblance to the artist himself.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nHis ''Self-portrait'' of 1941 shows him seated at the easel. His painting of ''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] Going to his Hanging'' (1942) is in the collection of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]] is part of a trilogy on the subject of the abolitionist who is sometimes credited with igniting the Civil War.<br />\n\n<!----- This is a non-free image, being used under \"fair use\" please don't increase the size or add another image of his paintings ----><center>\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Horace Pippin, John Brown Going to His Hanging.jpg|Horace Pippin, ''John Brown Going to His Hanging''\n</gallery>[[File:Lady of the Lake MET ma1982.55.1.jpg|center|thumb|''Lady of the Lake'', 1936, Oil on fabric]]<br /></center>\n\nHis portraits include a depiction of the [[contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]] singing, painted in 1941. \n\n''Mr. Prejudice,'' made at the request of an unidentified patron, is unique in Pippin's oeuvre for it's experimental composition and more overt use of iconography. The image sorts figures compositionally by race, with an African-American group on the left and white group on the right. The lower register reveals an assortment of military types. It has been suggested that the figure at center left, a soldier outfitted in an anachronistic WWI uniform, could signify Pippin himself. The black figures face forward, towards the viewer, while the white figures face left, towards the African-American group. In the painting's upper register, a white man is seen with a hammer, presumably splitting the large, golden V that surrounds him and divides the figures below. Winston Churchill coined the slogan \"V for Victory\" in the Allied campaign to end WWII. The slogan was expanded by African-American groups into the \"Double V\" campaign, which elaborated on the hope for victory abroad to include victory over discrimination and racism at home. Larger figures are shown along the edges of the picture's upper register. On the left, a brown-skinned Statue of Liberty raises her torch, lighting the way to freedom. On the right, a broad figure dressed in red holds a noose in one hand, with his gaze directed at Lady Liberty. Looming above him is a hooded member of the Ku Klux Klan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Horace Pippin, Mr. Prejudice|url=https://smarthistory.org/seeing-america-2/horace-pippins-mr-prejudice/|last=Smith|first=Jessica T.|date=February 22, 2019|website=Smarthistory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref>[[File:Mr-prejudice-1943.jpg|thumb|center|Mr. Prejudice painted by Horace Pippin in 1943|alt=|border]]\n  \n<br />Among Pippin's work there are many [[Genre art|genre paintings]], such as the ''[[Domino Game|Domino Players]]'' (1943), in the [[Phillips Collection]], [[Washington D.C.]], and several versions of ''Cabin in the Cotton''.\n[[File:Interior by Horace Pippin, 1944, National Gallery of Art, Washington.jpg|center|thumb|''Interior (also known as Interior of Cabin)'', 1944, Oil on Canvas]]\n\n\nPippin left ''The Park Bench'' unfinished in his studio at this death in 1946.
