This followed the re-election of all of the 99 council seats in the [[2018 Leeds City Council election|2018 all-out council election]]. It had resulted from an [[electoral ward]] [[boundary review]] and saw the election of three councillors for each of the 33 [[electoral wards]] and their new ward boundaries. The third-placed candidate elected in every ward was granted a single year term and their seats are up for election this year.\n\nElected councillors were granted the usual four-year term until 2023 in order to return to the typical election cycle of elections in three of every four years.<ref>http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/yorkshire-and-the-humber/west-yorkshire/leeds</ref><ref>{{cite web
