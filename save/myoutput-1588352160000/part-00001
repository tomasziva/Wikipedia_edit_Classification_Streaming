Longshaw obtained medical and pharmacy training in Boston, New York City, and New Orleans, receiving his medical degree from the University of Michigan. He was appointed acting assistant surgeon by the navy in 1862, serving aboard {{USS|Yankee|1861}}, {{USS|Passaic|1862}}, {{USS|Penobscot|1861}}, {{USS|Lehigh|1863}}, and finally his squadron's flagship {{USS|Minnesota|1855}}. \n\nOn several occasions Longshaw's gallantry and courageous actions under direct enemy fire were mentioned in reports by flag-level superiors like [[Rear Admiral]]s [[John Dahlgren]] and [[David Dixon Porter]] and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Wells]]. Supporting the navy's amphibious landing in the [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]] on January 15, 1865, Longshaw went onshore with the landing party and was active in tending to numerous wounded and dying during the assault. After rescuing an unconscious sailor in danger of drowning from the rising tide, Longshaw responded to the cry of a wounded marine and while treating him was shot in the head and died instantly. \n\nAfter a 1913 plea for recognition by [[United States Navy]] medical director [[James Duncan Gatewood]], in 1943 the navy commissioned a {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer}} {{USS|Longshaw|DD-559}} named in honor of the assistant surgeon.
