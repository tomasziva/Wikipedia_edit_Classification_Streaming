These different groups sometimes created distinct, independent alliances with nearby European powers. These included the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana; the [[English colonization of the Americas|English]] of the Southeast, and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era. During the [[American Revolution]], most Choctaw supported the [[Thirteen Colonies]]' bid for independence from the [[British Empire|British Crown]]. They never went to war against the United States but they were forcibly relocated in 1831-1833, as part of the [[Indian Removal]], as part of a genocidal land grab by European Americans.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Choctaw were classified by European Americans as one of the \"[[Five Civilized Tribes]]\" because they adopted numerous practices of their United States neighbors. The Choctaw and the United States (US) agreed to nine treaties. By the last three, the US gained vast land cessions; they [[Indian Removal|removed]] most Choctaw west of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Indian Territory]], sending them on a forced migration far from their homelands.

The Confederacy had suggested to their leaders that it would support a state under Indian control if it won the war.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana Choctaw fell into obscurity for some time. The Choctaw in Oklahoma no longer considered the Mississippi Choctaw part of the Choctaw Nation. However, [[Jack Amos (Mississippi Choctaw)|Jack Amos]] legally challenged the Choctaw Nation's stance at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1978, the United Supreme Court of the United States held that all remnants of the Choctaw Nation are entitled to all rights of the federally recognized Nation.<ref>''[[United States v. John (1978)|United States v. John]]'' 436 U.S. 637 (1978)</ref> The American Indian Policy Review Commission Final Report Volume I, Chapter 11, Page 468 on May 19, 1977 federally acknowledged/recognized the existence of the Choctaw Communities of Mobile and Washington Counties which are along the Tombigbee and Mobile Rivers where Choctaw Treaties were negotiated in various Choctaw Treaties.\n\nThe Choctaw in Oklahoma struggled to build a nation. They transferred the Choctaw Academy there and opened an academy for girls in the 1840s. In the aftermath of the [[Dawes Act]] in the late 19th century, the US dissolved tribal governments in order to extinguish Indian land claims and admit the Indian and Oklahoma territories as a state in 1907.  From that period, the US appointed chiefs of the Choctaw and other tribes in the former Indian Territory.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Choctaw soldiers served in the U.S. military as the first Native American [[codetalkers]], using the [[Choctaw language]]. After the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, the Choctaw reconstituted their government. The Choctaw Nation had kept their culture alive despite years of pressure for [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|assimilation]].\n\nThe Choctaw are the third-largest federally recognized tribe. Since the mid-twentieth century, the Choctaw have created new institutions, such as a [[tribal college]], housing authority, and justice system. Today the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], and the [[Jena Band of Choctaw Indians]] are the federally recognized Choctaw tribes. Mississippi also recognizes another band, and smaller Choctaw groups are located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas.  The Alabama Choctaw who are federally recognized under 24 C.F.R 1000 and 25 U.S.C. 4101 called the Native American Housing Self-Determination Act of 1986 (formerly the \"Indian\" Housing Act of 1937) under which the United States Federal Government jointly owns the MOWA Choctaw Indian Reservation as land held in trust as a reservation and for the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians per multiple deeds in public records in Mobile County, Alabama Department of Revenue Records. The Department of Interior has listed the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians as a trustee of Natural Resources in the Southeast Region of the United States.   The National Park Service under the Secretary of Interior has posted public notice of the MOWA Choctaw Indian Reservation in Alabama.  The Office of the Secretary of Interior issued the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians its Federal Bureau of Investigations ORI number formally acknowledging the Government to Government relationship in 1999.\n\nThe MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians in Alabama and the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council, which is composed solely of non-federally recognized tribes under Chief Framon Weaver, obtained a US Supreme Court ruling that sovereign immunity applies not only to entities such as the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council as an arm of the tribe, but also that sovereign immunity is inherent and possessed of Indians because they are Indians. This decision of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 2002.<ref>''[[Taylor v.

Occupation of Nanih Waiya and several smaller nearby mounds likely continued through 700 CE, the Late [[Woodland Period]]. The smaller mounds may also have been built by later cultures. As they have been lost to cultivation since the late 19th century and the area has not been excavated, theories have been speculation.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/archeology/cg/vol1_num1/mother.htm Ken Carleton, \"Nanih Waiya: Mother Mound of the Choctaw\"], ''The Delta Endangered'', Spring 1996, Vol.1 (1), NPS Archeology Program, accessed 16 November 2009</ref>\n\n===Mississippian culture===\n[[Image:Chromesun mississippian priest digital painting.jpg|right|upright=0.8|thumb|A Mississippian-era priest holding a severed head and ceremonial flint mace.]]\nThe Mississippian culture was a Native American culture that flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from 800 to 1500 CE.

In addition, it proposed the end of communal, tribal lands. Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members in [[severalty]] (individually). The US declared land in excess of the registered households needs to be \"surplus\" to the tribe, and took it for sale to new European-American settlers. In addition, individual ownership meant that Native Americans could sell their individual plots. This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the [[Dawes Commission]] to manage the land allotment policy; it registered members of the tribe and made allocations of lands.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/>\n\nBeginning in 1894, the Dawes Commission was established to register Choctaw and other families of the Indian Territory, so that the former tribal lands could be properly distributed among them. The final list included 18,981 citizens of the Choctaw Nation, 1,639 Mississippi Choctaw, and 5,994 former slaves (and descendants of former slaves), most held by Choctaws in the Indian/Oklahoma Territory. (At the same time, the Dawes Commission registered members of the other Five Civilized Tribes for the same purpose. The Dawes Rolls have become important records for proving tribal membership.) Following completion of the land allotments, the US proposed to end tribal governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and admit the two territories jointly as a state.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\" />\n\n====Territory transition to Oklahoma statehood (1889)====\n{{Further|Indian Territory|Oklahoma Territory}}\n\n[[Image:Choctaw Senate.jpg|left|upright=1.25|thumb|Choctaw Nation senate in 1898.

The government used its railroad access to the Oklahoma Territory to stimulate development there. The Indian Appropriations Bill of 1889 included an amendment by Illinois Representative [[William McKendree Springer]], that authorized President [[Benjamin Harrison]] to open the two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of Oklahoma Territory for settlement, resulting in the [[Land Run of 1889]]. The Choctaw Nation was overwhelmed with new settlers and could not regulate their activities. In the late 19th century, Choctaws suffered almost daily from violent crimes, murders, thefts and assaults from whites and from other Choctaws. Intense factionalism divided the traditionalistic \"Nationalists\" and pro-assimilation \"Progressives,\" who fought for control.<ref>Devon Abbott Mihesuah, ''Choctaw Crime and Punishment, 1884\u20131907'' (2009)</ref>\n\nIn 1905, delegates of the Five Civilized Tribes met at the [[Sequoyah Convention]] to write a constitution for an Indian-controlled state. They wanted to have Indian Territory admitted as the [[State of Sequoyah]]. Although they took a thoroughly developed proposal to Washington, DC, seeking approval, eastern states' representatives opposed it, not wanting to have two western states created in the area, as the Republicans feared that both would be Democrat-dominated, as the territories had a southern tradition of settlement. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a Republican, ruled that the Oklahoma and Indian territories had to be jointly admitted as one state, Oklahoma. To achieve this, tribal governments had to end and all residents accept state government. Many of the leading Native American representatives from the Sequoyah Convention participated in the new state convention. Its constitution was based on many elements of the one developed for the State of Sequoyah.<ref name=choctaw_ok_statehood />\n\nIn 1906 the U.S. dissolved the governments of the Five Civilized Tribes. This action was part of continuing negotiations by Native Americans and European Americans over the best proposals for the future.

World War I slowed down progress for the Indians as Washington's  bureaucracy focused on the war. Some Mississippi Choctaws also served during the war.

The 1933 ''Special Narrative Report'' described the dismal state of welfare of Mississippi Choctaws, whose population by 1930 had slightly increased to 1,665 people.<ref name=\"john_reed\"/> [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], the US Commissioner for Indian Affairs (now BIA), had worked for a decade on Indian affairs and been developing ideas to change federal policy.  He used the report as instrumental support to re-organize the Mississippi Choctaw as the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]]. This enabled them to establish their own tribal government, and gain a beneficial relationship with the federal government.\n\nIn 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934|Indian Reorganization Act]]. This law proved critical for survival of the Mississippi Choctaw. Baxter York, Emmett York, and Joe Chitto worked on gaining recognition for the Choctaw.<ref name=brescia_era>\n{{Cite book\n | last      = Brescia\n | first     = William (Bill)\n | title     = Tribal Government, A New Era\n | publisher = Choctaw Heritage Press\n | location  = Philadelphia, Mississippi\n | chapter   = Chapter 3, Treaties and the Choctaw People\n | pages     = 21\u201322\n | isbn      =\n | year = 1982\n}}\n</ref> They realized that the only way to gain recognition was to adopt a constitution.<ref name=brescia_era /> A rival organization, the [[Mississippi Choctaw Indian Federation]], opposed tribal recognition because of fears of dominance by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA).

Lands in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba]] and surrounding counties were set aside as a federal [[Indian reservation]]. Eight communities were included in the reservation land: [[Bogue Chitto, Mississippi|Bogue Chitto]], Bogue Homa, [[Conehatta, Mississippi|Conehatta]], Crystal Ridge, [[Pearl River, Mississippi|Pearl River]], [[Red Water, Mississippi|Red Water]], [[Tucker, Mississippi|Tucker]], and [[Standing Pine, Mississippi|Standing Pine]].\n\nUnder the Indian Reorganization Act, the Mississippi Choctaws re-organized on April 20, 1945 as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. This gave them some independence from the Democrat-dominated state government, which continued with enforcement of racial segregation and discrimination.\n\n===World War II (1941)===\n{{Further|Native Americans and World War II}}\n[[File:Choctaw Nation Congressional Gold Medal (front).jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Congressional Gold Medal awarded for WWI and WWII service]]\n[[World War II]] was a significant turning point for Choctaws and Native Americans in general. Although the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] stated Mississippi Choctaws had U.S. citizenship, they had become associated with \"colored people\" as non-white in a state that had imposed racial segregation under [[Jim Crow laws]]. State services for Native Americans were non-existent. The state was poor and still dependent on agriculture. In its system of segregation, services for minorities were consistently underfunded. The state constitution and voter registration rules dating from the turn of the 20th century kept most Native Americans from voting, making them ineligible to serve on juries or to be candidates for local or state offices. They were without political representation.<ref name=\"Stephen Edward Cresswell 2006, p.124\"/>\n\nA Mississippi Choctaw veteran stated, \"Indians were not supposed to go in the military back then ... the military was mainly for whites.

In 1953 the House of Representatives passed Resolution 108, proposing an end to federal services for 13 tribes deemed ready to handle their own affairs. The same year, Public Law 280 transferred jurisdiction over tribal lands to state and local governments in five states. Within a decade Congress terminated federal services to more than sixty groups despite intense opposition by Indians. Congress settled on a policy to [[Indian termination policy|terminate]] tribes as quickly as possible. Out of concern for the isolation of many Native Americans in rural areas, the federal government created relocation programs to cities to try to expand their employment opportunities. Indian policy experts hoped to expedite assimilation of Native Americans to the larger American society, which was becoming urban.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/>  In 1959, the Choctaw Termination Act was passed.<ref name=indian_termination>{{Cite web\n |url          = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96\n |title        = U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 108, 83rd Congress, 1953.

The Mississippi Choctaw would lay the foundations of business ventures.\n\nFederal policy under President [[Richard M. Nixon]] encouraged giving tribes more authority for self-determination, within a policy of federal recognition. Realizing the damage that had been done by termination of tribal status, he ended the federal emphasis of the 1950s on termination of certain tribes' federally recognized status and relationships with the federal government:\n\n{{quote|Forced termination is wrong, in my judgment, for a number of reasons.

The legislation authorized processes by which tribes could negotiate contracts with the BIA to manage directly more of their education and social service programs. In addition, it provided direct grants to help tribes develop plans for assuming such responsibility. It also provided for Indian parents' participation on local school boards.<ref name=\"William C.

They had many people available to work, natural resources, and no state or federal taxes. Industries have included automotive parts, greeting cards, direct mail and printing, and plastic-molding. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is one of the state's largest employers, running 19 businesses and employing 7,800 people.<ref name=\"mshistory.k12.ms.us\">[http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/10/choctaw-indians-in-the-21st-century Deborah Boykin, \"Choctaw Indians in the 21st Century\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210154522/http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/10/choctaw-indians-in-the-21st-century |date=2009-02-10 }}, Mississippi History Now, accessed 25 March 2009</ref>\n\nStarting with New Hampshire in 1963, numerous state governments began to operate lotteries and other gambling in order to raise money for government services, often promoting the programs by promising to earmark revenues to fund education, for instance. In 1987 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that [[federally recognized tribes]] could operate gaming facilities on reservations, as this was sovereign territory, and be  free from state regulation. As tribes began to develop gaming, starting with bingo, in 1988 the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA). It set the broad terms for Native American tribes to operate [[casino]]s, requiring that they do so only in states that had already authorized private gaming.<ref name=\"William C. Canby pp. 23-33\"/> Since then development of casino gaming has been one of the chief sources for many tribes of new revenues.\n\nThe [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] developed gaming operations and a related resort: the [[Choctaw Casino Resort]] and [[Choctaw Casino Bingo]] are their popular gaming destinations in [[Durant, Oklahoma|Durant]]. Located near the Oklahoma-Texas border, these sites attract residents of Southern Oklahoma and North Texas. The largest regional population base from which they draw is the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]].\n\nThe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI) unsuccessfully sought state agreement to develop gaming under the [[Ray Mabus]] administration. But in 1992 Mississippi Governor [[Kirk Fordice]] gave permission for the MBCI to develop Class III gaming. They have developed one of the largest casino resorts in the nation; it is located in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]] near the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]]. The Silver Star Casino opened its doors in 1994. The Golden Moon Casino opened in 2002. The casinos are collectively known as the [[Pearl River Resort]].\n\nAfter nearly two hundred years, the Choctaw have regained control of the ancient sacred site of [[Nanih Waiya]]. Mississippi protected the site for years as a state park. In 2006, the state legislature passed a bill to return ''Nanih Waiya'' to the Choctaw.\n\n===Jack Abramoff and Indian casino lobbying===\n\n{{Further|Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal}}\n[[Image:Abramoff SIAC 20040929 2.jpg|right|thumb|Image from video of Senate Indian Affairs Committee Hearing on 'Lobbying Practices Involving Indian Tribes' on September 29, 2004<ref>Found at indian.senate.gov</ref>]]\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]] was employed by Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP, the lobbying arm in Washington, DC of the [[Preston Gates & Ellis]] LLP law firm based in [[Seattle, Washington]]. In 1995, Abramoff began representing Native American tribes who wanted to develop gambling casinos, starting with the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]].\n\nThe Choctaw originally had lobbied the federal government directly, but beginning in 1994, they found that many of the congressional members who had responded to their issues had either retired or were defeated in the \"[[Republican Revolution]]\" of the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 elections]]. Nell Rogers, the tribe's specialist on legislative affairs, had a friend who was familiar with the work of Abramoff and his father as Republican activists. The tribe contacted Preston Gates, and soon after hired the firm and Abramoff.\n\nAbramoff succeeded in gaining defeat of a Congressional bill to use the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) to tax Native American casinos; it was sponsored by Reps. [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] (R-TX) and [[Ernest Istook]] (R-OK). Since the matter involved taxation, Abramoff enlisted help from [[Grover Norquist]], a Republican acquaintance from college, and his [[Americans for Tax Reform]] (ATR). The bill was eventually defeated in 1996 in the Senate, due in part to grassroots work by ATR. The Choctaw paid $60,000 in fees to Abramoff.\n\nAccording to ''Washington Business Forward'', a lobbying trade magazine, Senator [[Tom DeLay]] was also a major figure in achieving defeat of the bill. The fight strengthened Abramoff's alliance with him.<ref>[http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ www.bizforward.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206184358/http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ |date=December 6, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nPurporting to represent Native Americans before Congress and state governments in the developing field of gaming, [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal|Jack Abramoff]] and [[Michael Scanlon]] used fraudulent means to gain profits of $15 million in total payments from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.

The Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs voted 11\u20132 in support of federal recognition for the MOWA Choctaw.  To date the tribe has had 12 Congressional Bills, 3 appeals through the office of federal acknowledgement, and a federal lawsuit directed at its efforts for federal recognition.\n\nFederal recognition is not a pre-requisite to accord a tribe sovereign immunity, according to ''[[John. S. Bottomly v Passamaquoddy Tribe et al.]]'' 595 F.2d 1061 (1st Cir. 1979).  In Bottomly, the United States Supreme Court held that the availability of sovereign immunity is not conditioned on formal federal recognition of a particular tribe.

Their culture continued to evolve in the Southeast. The Choctaw practiced [[Head flattening]] as a ritual adornment for its people, but the practice eventually fell out of favor. Some of their communities had extensive trade and interaction with Europeans, including people from [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[England]] greatly shaped it as well. After the United States was formed and its settlers began to move into the Southeast, the Choctaw were among the Five Civilized Tribes, who adopted some of their ways. They transitioned to [[yeoman]] farming methods, and accepted [[European American]]s and [[African American]]s into their society.

The people had a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, with children born into the clan or iska of the mother and taking their social status from it. In this system, their maternal uncles had important roles. Identity was established first by moiety and iska; so a Choctaw identified first as Imoklasha or Inhulata, and second as Choctaw.

He died in Washington D.C. and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington D.C.\n* [[Mosholatubbee]] (1770\u20131836) was a chief in the Choctaw nation before the removal and after. He went to Washington City to negotiate for the tribe in 1824 and was the only major leader to return. In the summer of 1830, he ran for a seat in the Congress of the United States to represent the state of Mississippi.\n* [[Greenwood LeFlore]] (June 3, 1800 \u2013 August 31, 1865) was a District Chief of the Choctaws in Mississippi.

These different groups sometimes created distinct, independent alliances with nearby European powers. These included the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana; the [[English colonization of the Americas|English]] of the Southeast, and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era. During the [[American Revolution]], most Choctaw supported the [[Thirteen Colonies]]' bid for independence from the [[British Empire|British Crown]]. They never went to war against the United States but they were forcibly relocated in 1831-1833, as part of the [[Indian Removal]], in order for the US to take over their land for development by European Americans.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Choctaw were classified by European Americans as one of the \"[[Five Civilized Tribes]]\" because they adopted numerous practices of their United States neighbors. The Choctaw and the United States (US) agreed to nine treaties. By the last three, the US gained vast land cessions; they [[Indian Removal|removed]] most Choctaw west of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Indian Territory]], sending them on a forced migration far from their homelands.  The Choctaw were the first Native American tribe forced to relocate under the [[Indian Removal Act]].

The Confederacy had suggested to their leaders that it would support a state under Indian control if it won the war.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana Choctaw fell into obscurity for some time. The Choctaw in Oklahoma no longer considered the Mississippi Choctaw part of the Choctaw Nation. However, [[Jack Amos (Mississippi Choctaw)|Jack Amos]] legally challenged the Choctaw Nation's stance at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1978, the United Supreme Court of the United States held that all remnants of the Choctaw Nation are entitled to all rights of the federally recognized Nation.<ref>''[[United States v. John (1978)|United States v. John]]'' 436 U.S. 637 (1978)</ref> The American Indian Policy Review Commission Final Report Volume I, Chapter 11, Page 468 on May 19, 1977 federally acknowledged/recognized the existence of the Choctaw Communities of Mobile and Washington Counties which are along the Tombigbee and Mobile Rivers where Choctaw Treaties were negotiated in various Choctaw Treaties.\n\nThe Choctaw in Oklahoma struggled to build a nation. They transferred the Choctaw Academy there and opened an academy for girls in the 1840s. In the aftermath of the [[Dawes Act]] in the late 19th century, the US dissolved tribal governments in order to extinguish Indian land claims and admit the Indian and Oklahoma territories as a state in 1907.  From that period, the US appointed chiefs of the Choctaw and other tribes in the former Indian Territory.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Choctaw soldiers served in the U.S. military as the first Native American [[codetalkers]], using the [[Choctaw language]]. After the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, the Choctaw reconstituted their government. The Choctaw Nation had kept their culture alive despite years of pressure for [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|assimilation]].\n\nThe Choctaw are the third-largest federally recognized tribe. Since the mid-twentieth century, the Choctaw have created new institutions, such as a [[tribal college]], housing authority, and justice system. Today the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], and the [[Jena Band of Choctaw Indians]] are the federally recognized Choctaw tribes. Mississippi also recognizes another band, and smaller Choctaw groups are located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas.  The Alabama Choctaw who are federally recognized under 24 C.F.R 1000 and 25 U.S.C. 4101 called the Native American Housing Self-Determination Act of 1986 (formerly the \"Indian\" Housing Act of 1937) under which the United States Federal Government jointly owns the MOWA Choctaw Indian Reservation as land held in trust as a reservation and for the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians per multiple deeds in public records in Mobile County, Alabama Department of Revenue Records. The Department of Interior has listed the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians as a trustee of Natural Resources in the Southeast Region of the United States.   The National Park Service under the Secretary of Interior has posted public notice of the MOWA Choctaw Indian Reservation in Alabama.

In the aftermath of the Civil War, their issues were pushed aside in the struggle between defeated Confederates, [[freedmen]] and Union sympathizers. Records about the Mississippi Choctaw during this period are non-existent. They had no legal recourse, and were often bullied and intimidated by local whites, who tried to re-establish [[white supremacy]].<ref name=howard_and_Levine>\n{{Cite book\n | author    = James H.

They subjected the Choctaw to racial segregation and exclusion from public facilities along with [[freedmen]] and their descendants.

In addition, it proposed the end of communal, tribal lands. Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members in [[severalty]] (individually). The US declared land in excess of the registered households needs to be \"surplus\" to the tribe, and took it for sale to new European-American settlers. In addition, individual ownership meant that Native Americans could sell their individual plots. This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the [[Dawes Commission]] to manage the land allotment policy; it registered members of the tribe and made allocations of lands.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/>\n\nBeginning in 1894, the Dawes Commission was established to register Choctaw and other families of the Indian Territory, so that the former tribal lands could be properly distributed among them. The final list included 18,981 citizens of the Choctaw Nation, 1,639 Mississippi Choctaw, and 5,994 former slaves (and descendants of former slaves), most held by Choctaws in the Indian/Oklahoma Territory. (At the same time, the Dawes Commission registered members of the other Five Civilized Tribes for the same purpose. The Dawes Rolls have become important records for proving tribal membership.) Following completion of the land allotments, the US proposed to end tribal governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and admit the two territories jointly as a state.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\" />\n\n====Territory transition to Oklahoma statehood (1889)====\n{{Further|Indian Territory|Oklahoma Territory}}\n\n[[Image:Choctaw Senate.jpg|left|upright=1.25|thumb|Choctaw Nation senate in 1898.

The government used its railroad access to the Oklahoma Territory to stimulate development there. The Indian Appropriations Bill of 1889 included an amendment by Illinois Representative [[William McKendree Springer]], that authorized President [[Benjamin Harrison]] to open the two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of Oklahoma Territory for settlement, resulting in the [[Land Run of 1889]]. The Choctaw Nation was overwhelmed with new settlers and could not regulate their activities. In the late 19th century, Choctaws suffered almost daily from violent crimes, murders, thefts and assaults from whites and from other Choctaws. Intense factionalism divided the traditionalistic \"Nationalists\" and pro-assimilation \"Progressives,\" who fought for control.<ref>Devon Abbott Mihesuah, ''Choctaw Crime and Punishment, 1884\u20131907'' (2009)</ref>\n\nIn 1905, delegates of the Five Civilized Tribes met at the [[Sequoyah Convention]] to write a constitution for an Indian-controlled state. They wanted to have Indian Territory admitted as the [[State of Sequoyah]]. Although they took a thoroughly developed proposal to Washington, DC, seeking approval, eastern states' representatives opposed it, not wanting to have two western states created in the area, as the Republicans feared that both would be Democrat-dominated, as the territories had a southern tradition of settlement. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a Republican, ruled that the Oklahoma and Indian territories had to be jointly admitted as one state, Oklahoma. To achieve this, tribal governments had to end and all residents accept state government. Many of the leading Native American representatives from the Sequoyah Convention participated in the new state convention. Its constitution was based on many elements of the one developed for the State of Sequoyah.<ref name=choctaw_ok_statehood />\n\nIn 1906 the U.S. dissolved the governments of the Five Civilized Tribes. This action was part of continuing negotiations by Native Americans and European Americans over the best proposals for the future. The Choctaw Nation continued to protect resources not stipulated in treaty or law.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/> On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted to the union as the 46th state.\n\n===Mississippi Choctaw Delegation to Washington (1914)===\n\n[[Image:Wesley Johnson with Delegates.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right, Chief Wesley Johnson, T.

Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]], officials began numerous initiatives to alleviate some of the social and economic conditions in the South. The 1933 ''Special Narrative Report'' described the dismal state of welfare of Mississippi Choctaws, whose population by 1930 had slightly increased to 1,665 people.<ref name=\"john_reed\"/> [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], the US Commissioner for Indian Affairs (now BIA), had worked for a decade on Indian affairs and been developing ideas to change federal policy.  He used the report as instrumental support to re-organize the Mississippi Choctaw as the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]]. This enabled them to establish their own tribal government, and gain a beneficial relationship with the federal government.\n\nIn 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934|Indian Reorganization Act]]. This law proved critical for survival of the Mississippi Choctaw. Baxter York, Emmett York, and Joe Chitto worked on gaining recognition for the Choctaw.<ref name=brescia_era>\n{{Cite book\n | last      = Brescia\n | first     = William (Bill)\n | title     = Tribal Government, A New Era\n | publisher = Choctaw Heritage Press\n | location  = Philadelphia, Mississippi\n | chapter   = Chapter 3, Treaties and the Choctaw People\n | pages     = 21\u201322\n | isbn      =\n | year = 1982\n}}\n</ref> They realized that the only way to gain recognition was to adopt a constitution.<ref name=brescia_era /> A rival organization, the [[Mississippi Choctaw Indian Federation]], opposed tribal recognition because of fears of dominance by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA).

Lands in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba]] and surrounding counties were set aside as a federal [[Indian reservation]].

This gave them some independence from the Democrat-dominated state government, which continued with enforcement of racial segregation and discrimination.\n\n===World War II (1941)===\n{{Further|Native Americans and World War II}}\n[[File:Choctaw Nation Congressional Gold Medal (front).jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Congressional Gold Medal awarded for WWI and WWII service]]\n[[World War II]] was a significant turning point for Choctaws and Native Americans in general. Although the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] stated Mississippi Choctaws had U.S. citizenship, they had become associated with \"colored people\" as non-white in a state that had imposed racial segregation under [[Jim Crow laws]]. State services for Native Americans were non-existent. The state was poor and still dependent on agriculture. In its system of segregation, services for minorities were consistently underfunded. The state constitution and voter registration rules dating from the turn of the 20th century kept most Native Americans from voting, making them ineligible to serve on juries or to be candidates for local or state offices. They were without political representation.<ref name=\"Stephen Edward Cresswell 2006, p.124\"/>\n\nA Mississippi Choctaw veteran stated, \"Indians were not supposed to go in the military back then ... the military was mainly for whites.

In 1953 the House of Representatives passed Resolution 108, proposing an end to federal services for 13 tribes deemed ready to handle their own affairs. The same year, Public Law 280 transferred jurisdiction over tribal lands to state and local governments in five states. Within a decade Congress terminated federal services to more than sixty groups despite intense opposition by Indians. Congress settled on a policy to [[Indian termination policy|terminate]] tribes as quickly as possible. Out of concern for the isolation of many Native Americans in rural areas, the federal government created relocation programs to cities to try to expand their employment opportunities. Indian policy experts hoped to expedite assimilation of Native Americans to the larger American society, which was becoming urban.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/>  In 1959, the Choctaw Termination Act was passed.<ref name=indian_termination>{{Cite web\n |url          = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96\n |title        = U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 108, 83rd Congress, 1953.

In 1987 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that [[federally recognized tribes]] could operate gaming facilities on reservations, as this was sovereign territory, and be  free from state regulation. As tribes began to develop gaming, starting with bingo, in 1988 the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA). It set the broad terms for Native American tribes to operate [[casino]]s, requiring that they do so only in states that had already authorized private gaming.<ref name=\"William C. Canby pp. 23-33\"/> Since then development of casino gaming has been one of the chief sources for many tribes of new revenues.\n\nThe [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] developed gaming operations and a related resort: the [[Choctaw Casino Resort]] and [[Choctaw Casino Bingo]] are their popular gaming destinations in [[Durant, Oklahoma|Durant]]. Located near the Oklahoma-Texas border, these sites attract residents of Southern Oklahoma and North Texas. The largest regional population base from which they draw is the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]].\n\nThe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI) unsuccessfully sought state agreement to develop gaming under the [[Ray Mabus]] administration. But in 1992 Mississippi Governor [[Kirk Fordice]] gave permission for the MBCI to develop Class III gaming. They have developed one of the largest casino resorts in the nation; it is located in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]] near the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]]. The Silver Star Casino opened its doors in 1994. The Golden Moon Casino opened in 2002. The casinos are collectively known as the [[Pearl River Resort]].\n\nAfter nearly two hundred years, the Choctaw have regained control of the ancient sacred site of [[Nanih Waiya]]. Mississippi protected the site for years as a state park.

In 1995, Abramoff began representing Native American tribes who wanted to develop gambling casinos, starting with the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]].\n\nThe Choctaw originally had lobbied the federal government directly, but beginning in 1994, they found that many of the congressional members who had responded to their issues had either retired or were defeated in the \"[[Republican Revolution]]\" of the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 elections]]. Nell Rogers, the tribe's specialist on legislative affairs, had a friend who was familiar with the work of Abramoff and his father as Republican activists. The tribe contacted Preston Gates, and soon after hired the firm and Abramoff.\n\nAbramoff succeeded in gaining defeat of a Congressional bill to use the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) to tax Native American casinos; it was sponsored by Reps. [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] (R-TX) and [[Ernest Istook]] (R-OK). Since the matter involved taxation, Abramoff enlisted help from [[Grover Norquist]], a Republican acquaintance from college, and his [[Americans for Tax Reform]] (ATR). The bill was eventually defeated in 1996 in the Senate, due in part to grassroots work by ATR. The Choctaw paid $60,000 in fees to Abramoff.\n\nAccording to ''Washington Business Forward'', a lobbying trade magazine, Senator [[Tom DeLay]] was also a major figure in achieving defeat of the bill.

In Bottomly, the United States Supreme Court held that the availability of sovereign immunity is not conditioned on formal federal recognition of a particular tribe.  Therefore a tribe, its chief, nor its tribal officials do not need to prove that it has been federally recognized in order to assert immunity from suit for acts done in their official tribal capacity.\n\n*Mississippi, Live Oak Choctaw\n*Louisiana: \n-Bayou Lacombe Choctaw\n-Clifton Choctaw\n-Jena Band of Choctaw Indians\n-Choctaw-Apache of Ebarb\n\n===In the 2010 Census===\nIn the 2010 US Census, there were people who identified as Choctaw living in every state of the Union.<ref>2010 US Census table on reported tribes</ref>  The states with the largest Choctaw populations were:\n* Oklahoma \u2013 79,006\n* Texas \u2013 24,024\n* California \u2013 23,403\n* Mississippi \u2013 9,260\n* Arkansas \u2013 4,840\n* Alabama \u2013 4,513\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Choctaw}}\n\n[[Image:Tullockchishko.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|''Tullockchishko'' (Drinks the Juice of the Stones) was the greatest of Choctaw stickball players, 1834.]]\n\nThe Choctaw people are believed to have coalesced in the 17th century, perhaps from peoples from Alabama and the Plaquemine culture. Their culture continued to evolve in the Southeast. The Choctaw practiced [[Head flattening]] as a ritual adornment for its people, but the practice eventually fell out of favor. Some of their communities had extensive trade and interaction with Europeans, including people from [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[England]] greatly shaped it as well. After the United States was formed and its settlers began to move into the Southeast, the Choctaw were among the Five Civilized Tribes, who adopted some of their ways. They transitioned to [[yeoman]] farming methods, and accepted [[European American]]s and [[African American]]s into their society.

Each moiety had several clans or ''Iskas''; it is estimated there were about 12 Iskas altogether. The people had a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, with children born into the clan or iska of the mother and taking their social status from it. In this system, their maternal uncles had important roles. Identity was established first by moiety and iska; so a Choctaw identified first as Imoklasha or Inhulata, and second as Choctaw. Children belonged to the Iska of their mother.

The historian John Swanton wrote,\n<blockquote>[T]he Choctaws anciently regarded the sun as a deity ... the sun was ascribed the power of life and death. He was represented as looking down upon the earth, and as long as he kept his flaming eye fixed on any one, the person was safe ... fire, as the most striking representation of the sun, was considered as possessing intelligence, and as acting in concert with the sun ...

If the day of a conference were cloudy or rainy, Choctaws delayed the meeting until the sun returned, usually on the pretext that they needed more time to discuss particulars. They believed the sun made sure that all talks were honest.
