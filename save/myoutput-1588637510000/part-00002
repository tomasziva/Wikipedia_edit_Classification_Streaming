When IG-11 attempts to kill the infant per its bounty orders, the Mandalorian shoots and destroys the droid, taking the Child alive.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = [[Chapter 2: The Child]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Rick Famuyiwa]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|15}}\n |ShortSummary    = While returning to his ship with the Child, the Mandalorian fights and kills a group of rival bounty hunters who ambush him. Nearing his ship, he finds it being stripped by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawas]] for parts, and violently confronts them. When he tries to attack their [[sandcrawler]], the Jawas stun him and drop him from its roof. The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides. With the trade complete, the Mandalorian and Kuiil work together to repair the ship, allowing the Mandalorian to leave the planet with the Child.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = [[Chapter 3: The Sin]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Deborah Chow]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|22}}\n |ShortSummary    = The Mandalorian delivers the Child to the Client on Nevarro and collects the bounty of 20 bars of Beskar steel. Uncharacteristically, the Mandalorian asks about the Client's plans for the Child, but is told that it's none of his concern. He leaves before conflict arises. Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out.

The Mandalorian confides in her that no one has seen him without his helmet since childhood, when his tribe took him in as an orphan. Despite discovering that the raiders have an old Imperial [[AT-ST]], the villagers refuse to leave, so the Mandalorian and Dune train them to defend themselves. They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee. With peace restored, the Mandalorian plans to leave the Child in the village, but a Guild bounty hunter tracks it down and is killed by Dune.

They capture Shand in the desert, but she destroys one of their speeder bikes, so the Mandalorian goes to get a [[List of Star Wars species|dewback]] they passed for transportation. While Calican watches Shand, she tells him that the Mandalorian betrayed the guild, making the bounty on him and the Child worth more than hers. Shand offers to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he sets her free, but he shoots her instead and rides the remaining speeder bike to the repair dock, taking Motto and the Child hostage. The Mandalorian arrives, uses a [[flare]] to disorient Calican, and kills him. He takes Calican's money to pay Motto for the repairs, thanking her before leaving Tatooine.

Q9-0 finds the Child after deciphering the archived transmission from Greef Karga, but is shot by the Mandalorian before he can harm him. The Mandalorian delivers Qin to Ran and departs with his payment. Ran immediately moves to launch a fighter to kill the Mandalorian, but discovers the New Republic beacon had been placed on Qin, leading a trio of [[X-wing fighter|X-wings]] to Ran's station where they attack.

Sensing a trap, the Mandalorian recruits Cara Dune and Kuiil to assist him, and Kuiil brings a rebuilt and reprogrammed IG-11 to protect the Child. They meet Karga and his associates, but are attacked by [[Mynock]]s. Karga is injured, but the Child uses the Force to heal his wound. In return, Karga kills his associates and confesses his original plan to shoot the Mandalorian and take the Child to the Client. Karga pretends that Dune has captured the Mandalorian, while Kuiil returns the Child to the ship. During the meeting, [[Moff Gideon]]'s troops open fire on the building and kill the Client and his bodyguards, trapping the Mandalorian, Karga, and Dune inside. Gideon arrives, demanding the Child.

The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy.

Then he accepts an under-the-table commission on the outpost world of [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Nevarro|Nevarro]] from an enigmatic [[The Client (Star Wars)|client]] with apparent Imperial connections, directing him to track down and capture an unnamed fifty-year-old target. While the Client is indifferent to the target's well-being, his colleague [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Dr. Pershing|Dr. Pershing]] insists the target be brought back alive. The Mandalorian is given a down payment of a single bar of [[Beskar steel]], sacred to his people. He takes it to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an [[The Armorer (Star Wars)|armorer]] uses it to make him a [[pauldron]]. Arriving at the planet of the target's last reported location, the Mandalorian is aided by a vapor farmer named [[Kuiil]]. Tired of the chaos that bounty hunters bring to the area, Kuiil leads him to the target's location and departs. Entering the remote and heavily defended encampment, the Mandalorian reluctantly teams up with bounty hunting droid [[IG-11]] to clear the camp and find the quarry: a [[The Child (Star Wars)|child]] of [[Yoda's species]].

Nearing his ship, he finds it being stripped by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawas]] for parts, and violently confronts them. When he tries to attack their [[sandcrawler]], the Jawas stun him and drop him from its roof. The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides.

Uncharacteristically, the Mandalorian asks about the Client's plans for the Child, but is told that it's none of his concern. He leaves before conflict arises. Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out.

Following a short brawl, Dune explains that she is hiding after taking \"early retirement\", and asks the Mandalorian to leave. While he prepares his ship, two desperate fishermen approach, offering to hire him to drive off a band of [[List of Star Wars species|Klatoonian]] raiders. He accepts the job in exchange for lodging, using their credits to enlist Dune's help. At the village, they are housed by [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Omera|Omera]], a widowed mother. The Mandalorian confides in her that no one has seen him without his helmet since childhood, when his tribe took him in as an orphan. Despite discovering that the raiders have an old Imperial [[AT-ST]], the villagers refuse to leave, so the Mandalorian and Dune train them to defend themselves. They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee. With peace restored, the Mandalorian plans to leave the Child in the village, but a Guild bounty hunter tracks it down and is killed by Dune.

Calican needs to catch Shand to join the Guild, and the Mandalorian agrees to help when Calican offers to let him keep the money. They capture Shand in the desert, but she destroys one of their speeder bikes, so the Mandalorian goes to get a [[List of Star Wars species|dewback]] they passed for transportation. While Calican watches Shand, she tells him that the Mandalorian betrayed the guild, making the bounty on him and the Child worth more than hers. Shand offers to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he sets her free, but he shoots her instead and rides the remaining speeder bike to the repair dock, taking Motto and the Child hostage. The Mandalorian arrives, uses a [[flare]] to disorient Calican, and kills him. He takes Calican's money to pay Motto for the repairs, thanking her before leaving Tatooine.

After infiltrating the prison ship, they fight through security droids and make it to the control room where the ship's security chief triggers a security beacon before being killed by Xi'an. The crew rescues Qin but double-crosses the Mandalorian. He escapes and defeats each crew member, then captures Qin. Q9-0 finds the Child after deciphering the archived transmission from Greef Karga, but is shot by the Mandalorian before he can harm him. The Mandalorian delivers Qin to Ran and departs with his payment. Ran immediately moves to launch a fighter to kill the Mandalorian, but discovers the New Republic beacon had been placed on Qin, leading a trio of [[X-wing fighter|X-wings]] to Ran's station where they attack.

Sensing a trap, the Mandalorian recruits Cara Dune and Kuiil to assist him, and Kuiil brings a rebuilt and reprogrammed IG-11 to protect the Child. They meet Karga and his associates, but are attacked by [[Mynock]]s. Karga is injured, but the Child uses the Force to heal his wound. In return, Karga kills his associates and confesses his original plan to shoot the Mandalorian and take the Child to the Client. Karga pretends that Dune has captured the Mandalorian, while Kuiil returns the Child to the ship. During the meeting, [[Moff Gideon]]'s troops open fire on the building and kill the Client and his bodyguards, trapping the Mandalorian, Karga, and Dune inside. Gideon arrives, demanding the Child.

The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy.

be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nSeveral writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a [[tabula rasa]] effect and his anonymity allows viewers to
