The evolution of sex contains two related yet distinct themes: its ''origin'' and its ''maintenance''.\n\nThe origin of sexual reproduction can be traced to early [[prokaryote]]s, around two billion years ago (Gya), when bacteria began exchanging genes via [[Sexual conjugation|conjugation]], [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]], and [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/sexual-reproduction-and-the-evolution-of-sex-824|title=Sexual Reproduction and the Evolution of Sex|last=Otto|first=Sarah|date=2014|website=Scitable|access-date=28 Feb 2019}}</ref> Though these processes are distinct from true sexual reproduction, they share some basic similarities.

The maintenance of sexual reproduction (specifically, of its [[dioecious]] form) by natural selection in a highly competitive world has long been one of the major mysteries of biology, since both other known mechanisms of reproduction \u2013 [[asexual reproduction]] and [[hermaphroditism]] \u2013 possess apparent advantages over it. Asexual reproduction can proceed by budding, fission, or spore formation and does not involve the union of gametes, which accordingly results in [[#xspeed|a much faster rate]] of reproduction compared to sexual reproduction, where 50% of offspring are males and unable to produce offspring themselves. In hermaphroditic reproduction, each of the two parent organisms required for the formation of a [[zygote]] can provide either the male or the female gamete, which leads to advantages in both size and genetic variance of a population.\n\nSexual reproduction therefore must offer significant [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantages because, despite the two-fold cost of sex (see below), it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced by sexual processes outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from [[genetic recombination|recombination]], where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual [[Self-replication|replication]], where the offspring is always identical to the parents (barring mutation). Recombination supplies two [[fault-tolerance]] mechanisms at the molecular level: ''recombinational [[DNA repair]]'' (promoted during [[meiosis]] because [[homologous chromosome]]s pair at that time) and ''[[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]]'' (also known as [[heterosis]], hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).\n\n==Historical perspective==\nThe issue of the evolution of sexual reproduction features in the writings of [[Aristotle]], and modern philosophical-scientific thinking on the problem dates from at least [[Erasmus Darwin]] (1731\u20131802) in the 18th century. [[August Weismann]] picked up the thread in 1889, arguing that sex serves to generate [[genetic variation]], as detailed in the majority of the explanations below. On the other hand, [[Charles Darwin]] (1809\u20131882) concluded that the effect of [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor]] (complementation) \"is amply sufficient to account for the ... genesis of the two sexes\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This is consistent with the repair and complementation hypothesis, described below. Since the emergence of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the 20th century, numerous biologists including [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Alexey Kondrashov]], [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein, Michael M. Cox, Frederic A. Hopf and Richard E. Michod \u2013 have suggested competing explanations for how a vast array of different living species maintain sexual reproduction.\n\n==Disadvantages of sex and sexual reproduction==\nThe paradox of the existence of sexual reproduction is that though it is ubiquitous in multicellular organisms, there are ostensibly many inherent disadvantages to reproducing sexually when weighed against the relative advantages of alternative forms of reproduction, such as asexual reproduction. Thus, because sexual reproduction abounds in complex multicellular life, there must be some significant benefit(s) to sex and sexual reproduction that compensates for these fundamental disadvantages.\n\n==={{anchor|Two-fold cost}}{{anchor|xspeed}}Population expansion cost of sex===\nAmong the most limiting disadvantages to the evolution of sexual reproduction by natural selection is that an asexual population can grow much more rapidly than a sexual one with each generation.\n\nFor example, assume that the entire population of some theoretical species has 100 total organisms consisting of two sexes (i.e. males and females), with 50:50 male-to-female representation, and that only the females of this species can bear offspring. If all capable members of this population procreated once, a total of 50 offspring would be produced (the ''F<sub>1</sub>'' generation). Contrast this outcome with an asexual species, in which each and every member of an equally sized 100-organism population is capable of bearing young. If all capable members of this asexual population procreated once, a total of 100 offspring would be produced \u2013 twice as many as produced by the sexual population in a single generation.\n\n[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates the ''two-fold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]\nThis idea is sometimes referred to as the '''two-fold cost''' of sexual reproduction. It was first described mathematically by [[John Maynard Smith]].<ref name=\"maynard\">{{cite book|authorlink=John Maynard Smith|first = J. Maynard|last = Smith|title =The Evolution of Sex|date= 1978|publisher = Cambridge University Press|url =https://archive.org/details/evolutionofsex0000mayn|url-access=registration|isbn = 9780521293020}}</ref> In his manuscript, Smith further speculated on the impact of an asexual mutant arising in a sexual population, which suppresses [[meiosis]] and allows eggs to develop into offspring genetically identical to the mother by mitotic division.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\">{{Cite book|title=Evolution : an introduction|last=1946-|first=Stearns, S.

Indeed, some multicellular organisms ([[isogamy|isogamous]]) engage in sexual reproduction but all members of the species are capable of bearing offspring.<ref name=\"Hoekstra\">{{cite book|authorlink=Rolf Hoekstra|first=Rolf F.|last = Hoekstra|date= 1987|title= The Evolution of Sex and its Consequences|publisher=Springer Basel AG|editor-first=Stephen C.|editor-last=Stearns|chapter = The Evolution of Sexes|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1cQACAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA59|isbn = 9783034862738}}</ref> The two-fold reproductive disadvantage assumes that males contribute only genes to their offspring and sexual females waste half their reproductive potential on sons.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\"/> Thus, in this formulation, the principal cost of sex is that males and females must successfully [[copulation (zoology)|copulate]], which almost always involves expending energy to come together through time and space. Asexual organisms need not expend the energy necessary to find a mate.\n\n===Selfish cytoplasmic genes===\nSexual reproduction implies that chromosomes and alleles segregate and recombine in every generation, but not all genes are transmitted together to the offspring.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\"/> There is a chance of spreading mutants that cause unfair transmission at the expense of their non-mutant colleagues. These mutations are referred to as \"selfish\" because they promote their own spread at the cost of alternative alleles or of the host organism; they include nuclear meiotic drivers and selfish cytoplasmic genes.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\"/> [[Meiotic drive]]rs are genes that distort meiosis to produce gametes containing themselves more than the 50% of the time expected by chance. A selfish cytoplasmic gene is a gene located in an organelle, plasmid or intracellular parasite that modifies reproduction to cause its own increase at the expense of the cell or organism that carries it.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\"/>\n\n===Genetic heritability cost of sex===\nA sexually reproducing organism only passes on ~50% of its own genetic material to each L2 offspring. This is a consequence of the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are [[haploid]]. Again, however, this is not applicable to all sexual organisms. There are numerous species which are sexual but do not have a genetic-loss problem because they do not produce males or females. Yeast, for example, are [[isogamy|isogamous]] sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid genomes. Both sexes reproduce during the haploid and diploid stages of their life cycle and have a 100% chance of passing their genes into their offspring.<ref name=\"Hoekstra\" />\n\nSome species avoid the 50% cost of sexual reproduction, although they have \"sex\" (in the sense of [[genetic recombination]]). In these species (e.g., [[bacteria]], [[ciliates]], [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[diatom]]s), \"sex\" and reproduction occurs separately.<ref name=\"Ridley M 2004 p. 314\"/><ref>Beukeboom, L. & Perrin, N.

Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].</ref>\n\n==Advantages of sex and sexual reproduction==\nThe concept of sex includes two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation of this information into two parts). Depending on the presence or absence of these phenomena, all of the existing forms of reproduction can be classified as asexual, hermaphrodite or dioecious. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are diametrically opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.\n\nReproductive advantages of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny, and the advantages of the hermaphrodite forms are in maximal diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of at least half of the diversity. So, the primary challenge is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.<ref>Crow J.F. (1994). Advantages of Sexual Reproduction, Dev. Gen., vol.15, pp. 205-213.</ref>\n\n===Advantages due to genetic variation===\n{{See also|Hill\u2013Robertson effect}}\nFor the advantage due to genetic variation, there are three possible reasons this might happen. First, sexual reproduction can combine the effects of two beneficial [[mutation]]s in the same individual (i.e. sex aids in the spread of advantageous traits). Also, the necessary mutations do not have to have occurred one after another in a single line of descendants.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Goldstein\n |first=R N\n |year=2010\n |title=36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction\n |page=\n |publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]\n |isbn=978-0-307-37818-7\n |url=https://archive.org/details/36argumentsforex00gold\n }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}} Second, sex acts to bring together currently deleterious mutations to create severely unfit individuals that are then eliminated from the population (i.e. sex aids in the removal of deleterious genes). However, in organisms containing only one set of chromosomes, deleterious mutations would be eliminated immediately, and therefore removal of harmful mutations is an unlikely benefit for sexual reproduction. Lastly, sex creates new gene combinations that may be more fit than previously existing ones, or may simply lead to reduced competition among relatives.\n\nFor the advantage due to DNA repair, there is an immediate large benefit of removing DNA damage by recombinational [[DNA repair]] during [[meiosis]], since this removal allows greater survival of progeny with undamaged DNA. The advantage of [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] to each sexual partner is avoidance of the bad effects of their deleterious recessive genes in progeny by the masking effect of normal dominant genes contributed by the other partner.\n\nThe classes of hypotheses based on the creation of variation are further broken down below. Any number of these hypotheses may be true in any given species (they are not [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]), and different hypotheses may apply in different species. However, a research framework based on creation of variation has yet to be found that allows one to determine whether the reason for sex is universal for all sexual species, and, if not, which mechanisms are acting in each species.\n\nOn the other hand, the maintenance of sex based on DNA repair and complementation applies widely to all sexual species.\n\n===Protection from major genetic mutation===\nIn contrast to the view that sex promotes genetic variation, Heng,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heng HH | year = 2007 | title = Elimination of altered karyotypes by sexual reproduction preserves species identity | url = | journal = Genome | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 517\u2013524 | pmid = 17612621 | doi=10.1139/g07-039 | first2 = Henry H.Q.| last2 = Heng }}</ref> and Gorelick and Heng<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gorelick R, Heng HH | year = 2011 | title = Sex reduces genetic variation: a multidisciplinary review | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 1088\u20131098 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01173.x | pmid = 21091466 | last2 = Heng }}</ref> reviewed evidence that sex actually acts as a constraint on genetic variation. They consider that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve.\n\n===Novel genotypes===\n[[File:Evolsex-dia2a.svg|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates how sex might create novel genotypes more rapidly. Two advantageous alleles ''A'' and ''B'' occur at random. The two alleles are recombined rapidly in a sexual population (top), but in an asexual population (bottom) the two alleles must independently arise because of [[clonal interference]].]]\nSex could be a method by which novel genotypes are created. Because sex combines genes from two individuals, sexually reproducing populations can more easily combine advantageous genes than can asexual populations. If, in a sexual population, two different advantageous [[alleles]] arise at different loci on a chromosome in different members of the population, a chromosome containing the two advantageous alleles can be produced within a few generations by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. However, should the same two alleles arise in different members of an asexual population, the only way that one chromosome can develop the other allele is to independently gain the same mutation, which would take much longer. Several studies have addressed counterarguments, and the question of whether this model is sufficiently robust to explain the predominance of sexual versus asexual reproduction remains.<ref name=\"Birdsell\"/>{{rp|73\u201386}}\n\n[[Ronald Fisher]] also suggested that sex might facilitate the spread of advantageous genes by allowing them to better escape their genetic surroundings, if they should arise on a chromosome with deleterious genes.\n\nSupporters of these theories respond to the balance argument that the individuals produced by sexual and asexual reproduction may differ in other respects too \u2013 which may influence the persistence of sexuality. For example, in the [[Asexual reproduction#Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction|heterogamous]] [[water flea]]s of the genus ''Cladocera'', sexual offspring form eggs which are better able to survive the winter versus those the fleas produce asexually.\n\n===Increased resistance to parasites===\nOne of the most widely discussed theories to explain the persistence of sex is that it is maintained to assist sexual individuals in resisting [[parasite]]s, also known as the [[Red Queen Hypothesis]].<ref name=\"ridley\">[[Matt Ridley]] 1995 ''The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature'' 1995 Penguin.</ref><ref name=Birdsell>{{cite book | last1 = Birdsell | first1 = JA | last2 = Wills | first2 = C | year = 2003 | title = The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4757-5190-1_2 | journal = Evolutionary Biology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 27\u2013137 | isbn = 978-1-4419-3385-0 }}</ref>{{rp|113\u2013117}}<ref>MacIntyre, Ross J.; Clegg, Michael, T (Eds.), Springer.

If the environment changed sufficiently rapidly (i.e. between generations), these changes in the environment can make sex advantageous for the individual. Such rapid changes in environment are caused by the co-evolution between hosts and parasites.\n\nImagine, for example that there is one gene in parasites with two alleles ''p'' and ''P'' conferring two types of parasitic ability, and one gene in hosts with two alleles ''h'' and ''H'', conferring two types of parasite resistance, such that parasites with allele ''p'' can attach themselves to hosts with the allele ''h'', and ''P'' to ''H''. Such a situation will lead to cyclic changes in allele frequency - as ''p'' increases in frequency, ''h'' will be disfavoured.\n\nIn reality, there will be several genes involved in the relationship between hosts and parasites. In an asexual population of hosts, offspring will only have the different parasitic resistance if a mutation arises. In a sexual population of hosts, however, offspring will have a new combination of parasitic resistance alleles.\n\nIn other words, like [[Lewis Carroll]]'s Red Queen, sexual hosts are continually \"running\" (adapting) to \"stay in one place\" (resist parasites).\n\nEvidence for this explanation for the evolution of sex is provided by comparison of the rate of molecular evolution of genes for [[kinase]]s and [[immunoglobulin]]s in the [[immune system]] with genes coding other [[protein]]s. The genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably faster.<ref name=\"kuma\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kuma | first1 = K. | last2 = Iwabe | first2 = N. | last3 = Miyata | first3 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Functional constraints against variations on molecules from the tissue-level - slowly evolving brain-specific genes demonstrated by protein-kinase and immunoglobulin supergene families | url = | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 123\u2013130 | pmid = 7877487 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040181 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"wolfe\">{{cite journal | author = Wolfe KH, Sharp PM | year = 1993 | title = Mammalian gene evolution - nucleotide-sequence divergence between mouse and rat | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 441\u2013456 | doi = 10.1007/BF00178874 | pmid = 8308912 | last2 = Sharp | bibcode = 1993JMolE..37..441W }}</ref>\n\nFurther evidence for the Red Queen hypothesis was provided by observing long\u2010term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a \"mixed\" (sexual and asexual) population of snails (''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]''). The number of sexuals, the number asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, sexual snail populations remained much more stable over time.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/599080 | last1 = Jokela | first1 = Jukka | last2 = Dybdahl | first2 = Mark | last3 = Lively | first3 = Curtis | year = 2009 | title = The Maintenance of Sex, Clonal Dynamics, and Host-Parasite Coevolution in a Mixed Population of Sexual and Asexual Snails | jstor = 10.1086/599080| journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 174 | issue = s1 | pages = S43\u201353 | pmid=19441961| url = https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A6224/datastream/PDF/view }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090706171542.htm | title = Parasites May Have Had Role In Evolution Of Sex | date = 31 July 2009 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate= 19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Hanley et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hanley KA |author2=Fisher RN |author3=Case TJ | year = 1995 | title = Lower mite infestations in an asexual gecko compared with its sexual ancestors | journal = Evolution | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 418\u2013426 | jstor=2410266 | doi = 10.2307/2410266|pmid=28565091 }}</ref> studied mite infestations of a [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] gecko species and its two related sexual ancestral species.

They genetically manipulated the [[mating system]] of ''C. elegans'', causing populations to mate either sexually, by self-fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the ''S. marcescens'' parasite. It was found that the self-fertilizing populations of ''C. elegans'' were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen Hypothesis.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1206360 | last1 = Morran | first1 = Levi T. | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = Olivia G. | last3 = Gelarden | first3 = Ian A. | last4 = Parrish Rc | first4 = Raymond C. | last5 = Lively | first5 = Curtis M. | year = 2011 | title = Running with the Red Queen: Host-Parasite Coevolution Selects for Biparental Sex | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6039 | pages = 216\u2013218 | pmid = 21737739 | pmc = 3402160| bibcode = 2011Sci...333..216M }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110707141158.htm | title = Sex -- As We Know It -- Works Thanks to Ever-Evolving Host-Parasite Relationships, Biologists Find | date = 9 July 2011 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>  In natural populations of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', self-fertilization is the predominant mode of reproduction, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of about 1%.<ref name=\"pmid16005289\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barri\u00e8re A, F\u00e9lix MA |title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

Recombinational repair is the only repair process known which can accurately remove double-strand damages in DNA, and such damages are both common in nature and ordinarily lethal if not repaired. For instance, double-strand breaks in DNA occur about 50 times per cell cycle in human cells (see [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|naturally occurring DNA damage]]). Recombinational repair is prevalent from the simplest viruses to the most complex multicellular eukaryotes. It is effective against many different types of genomic damage, and in particular is highly efficient at overcoming double-strand damages. Studies of the mechanism of meiotic recombination indicate that meiosis is an adaptation for repairing DNA.<ref name=\"replication-help\">{{cite journal |author1=Cox MM |title=Historical overview: searching for replication help in all of the rec places |journal=Proc.

[[Outcrossing]], the second fundamental aspect of sex, is maintained by the advantage of masking mutations and the disadvantage of [[inbreeding]] (mating with a close relative) which allows expression of recessive mutations (commonly observed as [[inbreeding depression]]). This is in accord with [[Charles Darwin]],<ref>Darwin CR (1876). The effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881_Worms_F1357/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249.html] see page 462</ref> who concluded that the adaptive advantage of sex is hybrid vigor; or as he put it, \"the offspring of two individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have a great advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one of the same parents.\"\n\nHowever, outcrossing may be abandoned in favor of parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when there has been a forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.\n\nIn the view of the repair and complementation hypothesis, the removal of DNA damage by recombinational repair produces a new, less deleterious form of informational noise, allelic recombination, as a by-product. This lesser informational noise generates genetic variation, viewed by some as the major effect of sex, as discussed in the earlier parts of this article.\n\n==Deleterious mutation clearance==\n[[Mutation]]s can have many different effects upon an organism. It is generally believed that the majority of non-neutral mutations are deleterious, which means that they will cause a decrease in the organism's overall fitness.<ref name=\"Griffiths\">Griffiths ''et al.'' 1999.

Asexual organisms do not have the ability to recombine their genetic information to form new and differing alleles. Once a mutation occurs in the DNA or other genetic carrying sequence, there is no way for the mutation to be removed from the population until another mutation occurs that ultimately deletes the primary mutation. This is rare among organisms. Hermann Joseph Muller introduced the idea that mutations build up in asexual reproducing organisms. Muller described this occurrence by comparing the mutations that accumulate as a ratchet. Each mutation that arises in asexually reproducing organisms turns the ratchet once. The ratchet is unable to be rotated backwards, only forwards. The next mutation that occurs turns the ratchet once more. Additional mutations in a population continually turn the ratchet and the mutations, mostly deleterious, continually accumulate without recombination.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = H.J. | year = 1964 | title = The Relation of Recombination to Mutational Advance | url = | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 2\u20139 | doi=10.1016/0027-5107(64)90047-8| pmid = 14195748 }}</ref> These mutations are passed onto the next generation because the offspring are exact genetic clones of their parent. The genetic load of organisms and their populations will increase due to the addition of multiple deleterious mutations and decrease the overall reproductive success and fitness.\n\nFor sexually reproducing populations, studies have shown that single-celled bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. Passaging a population through a single-celled bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a single-celled bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niklas|first=Karl J.|date=2014-01-01|title=The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity|url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=101|issue=1|pages=6\u201325|doi=10.3732/ajb.1300314|issn=0002-9122|pmid=24363320}}</ref> Further studies using ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high relatedness. Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low relatedness may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to [[kin selection]]. The studies with ''D. discoideum'' showed that conditions of high relatedness resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low relatedness, suggesting the importance of high relatedness to resist mutations from proliferating.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuzdzal-Fick|first=Jennie J.|last2=Fox|first2=Sara A.|last3=Strassmann|first3=Joan E.|last4=Queller|first4=David C.|date=2011-12-16|title=High Relatedness Is Necessary and Sufficient to Maintain Multicellularity in Dictyostelium|journal=Science|language=en|volume=334|issue=6062|pages=1548\u20131551|doi=10.1126/science.1213272|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22174251|bibcode=2011Sci...334.1548K}}</ref>\n\n===Removal of deleterious genes===\n[[File:Synergistic versus antagonistic epistasis.svg|thumb|200px|Diagram illustrating different relationships between numbers of mutations and fitness.

Roberts and Company Publishers.</ref> - each subsequent mutation has a disproportionately large effect on the organism's fitness.]]\nThis hypothesis was proposed by [[Alexey Kondrashov]], and is sometimes known as the ''deterministic mutation hypothesis''.<ref name=\"kondrashov\"/> It assumes that the majority of deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and fitness is known as [[epistasis|''synergistic epistasis'']].\n\nBy way of [[analogy]], think of a [[Automobile|car]] with several minor faults. Each is not sufficient alone to prevent the car from running, but in combination, the faults combine to prevent the car from functioning.\n\nSimilarly, an organism may be able to cope with a few defects, but the presence of many mutations could overwhelm its backup mechanisms.\n\nKondrashov argues that the slightly deleterious nature of mutations means that the population will tend to be composed of individuals with a small number of mutations. Sex will act to [[Genetic recombination|recombine]] these genotypes, creating some individuals with fewer deleterious mutations, and some with more. Because there is a major selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out. In essence, sex compartmentalises the deleterious mutations.\n\nThere has been much criticism of Kondrashov's theory, since it relies on two key restrictive conditions. The first requires that the rate of deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation in order to provide a substantial advantage for sex. While there is some empirical evidence for it (for example in [[Drosophila]]<ref name=\"Drosophila\">{{cite journal | last1 = Whitlock | first1 = M.

The male partition is suggested to be an \"experimental\" part of the species that allows the species to expand their ecological niche, and to have alternative configurations. This theory underlines the higher variability and higher mortality in males, in comparison to females. This functional partitioning also explains the higher susceptibility to disease in males, in comparison to females and therefore includes the idea of \"protection against parasites\" as another functionality of male sex. Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex was developed in Russia in 1960\u20131980 and was not known to the West till the era of the Internet.

A comprehensive theory called \"origin of sex as vaccination\" proposes that eukaryan sex-as-[[fertilisation|syngamy]] (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection, when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by other, more virulent symbionts.\n\nConsequently, sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) would evolve as a host strategy for uncoupling from (and thereby render impotent) the acquired symbiotic/parasitic genes.<ref name=\"sterrer\">{{cite journal |author=Sterrer W |title=On the origin of sex as vaccination |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=216 |issue=4 |pages=387\u2013396 |year=2002 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008 |pmid=12151256}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanistic origin of sexual reproduction==\nWhile theories positing fitness benefits that led to the origin of sex are often problematic,{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} several theories addressing the emergence of the mechanisms of sexual reproduction have been proposed.\n\n===Viral eukaryogenesis===\n{{main| Viral eukaryogenesis}}\nThe viral eukaryogenesis (VE) theory proposes that eukaryotic cells arose from a combination of a [[lysogenic]] virus, an [[archaea]]n, and a [[bacterium]]. This model suggests that the nucleus originated when the lysogenic virus incorporated genetic material from the archaean and the bacterium and took over the role of information storage for the amalgam. The archaeal host transferred much of its functional genome to the virus during the evolution of cytoplasm, but retained the function of gene translation and general metabolism. The bacterium transferred most of its functional genome to the virus as it transitioned into a [[mitochondria|mitochondrion]].<ref name=\"bell-2001\">{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Viral eukaryogenesis: Was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=251\u2013256 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s002390010215 |pmid=11523012|bibcode=2001JMolE..53..251L }}</ref>\n\nFor these transformations to lead to the eukaryotic cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short [[telomere|telomeric]] repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the [[cytoplasm]]. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"bell-2006\">{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=243 |issue=1 |pages=54\u201363 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.05.015 |pmid=16846615 }}</ref>\n\n[[Meiotic]] division in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus as a result of its inability to enter into the [[lytic cycle]]. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.)<ref name=\"bell-2001\" /> The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.<ref name=\"bell-2006\" />\n\nThe two viruses established in the cell would initiate replication in response to signals from the host cell. A mitosis-like cell cycle would proceed until the viral membranes dissolved, at which point linear chromosomes would be bound together with centromeres. The homologous nature of the two viral centromeres would incite the grouping of both sets into tetrads. It is speculated that this grouping may be the origin of crossing over, characteristic of the first division in modern meiosis. The partitioning apparatus of the mitotic-like cell cycle the cells used to replicate independently would then pull each set of chromosomes to one side of the cell, still bound by centromeres. These centromeres would prevent their replication in subsequent division, resulting in four daughter cells with one copy of one of the two original pox-like viruses. The process resulting from combination of two similar pox viruses within the same host closely mimics meiosis.<ref name=\"bell-2006\" />\n\n===Neomuran revolution===\nAn alternative theory, proposed by [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], was labeled the [[Neomura|Neomuran revolution]]. The designation \"Neomuran revolution\" refers to the appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because they are based on the \"theoretically and empirically\" unsound model of [[molecular clock]]s. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of [[nucleosome]]s. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.<ref name=\"TCSmith\">{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith, Thomas |title=Cell evolution and Earth history: Stasis and revolution |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=969\u20131006 |year=2006 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1842 |pmid=16754610 |pmc=1578732 }}</ref>\n\n{{Wikipedia books|Sex}}{{clear}}\n\n==Questions==\nSome questions biologists have attempted to answer include:\n* Why does sexual reproduction exist, if in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction?<ref name=\"Ridley M 2004 p. 314\">{{cite book|last =Ridley|first= Mark|date= 2003 |title =Evolution|edition = 3rd |publisher = Wiley|page = 314|isbn = 9781405103459}}</ref>\n* Did [[mating type]]s (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) arise as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or did mating types evolve before anisogamy?<ref>T.

The evolution of sex contains two related yet distinct themes: its ''origin'' and its ''maintenance''.\n\nThe origin of sexual reproduction can be traced to early [[prokaryote]]s, around two billion years ago (Gya), when bacteria began exchanging genes via [[Sexual conjugation|conjugation]], [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]], and [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/sexual-reproduction-and-the-evolution-of-sex-824|title=Sexual Reproduction and the Evolution of Sex|last=Otto|first=Sarah|date=2014|website=Scitable|access-date=28 Feb 2019}}</ref> Though these processes are distinct from true sexual reproduction, they share some basic similarities.

The maintenance of sexual reproduction (specifically, of its [[dioecious]] form) by natural selection in a highly competitive world has long been one of the major mysteries of biology, since both other known mechanisms of reproduction \u2013 [[asexual reproduction]] and [[hermaphroditism]] \u2013 possess apparent advantages over it. Asexual reproduction can proceed by budding, fission, or spore formation and does not involve the union of gametes, which accordingly results in [[#xspeed|a much faster rate]] of reproduction compared to sexual reproduction, where 50% of offspring are males and unable to produce offspring themselves. In hermaphroditic reproduction, each of the two parent organisms required for the formation of a [[zygote]] can provide either the male or the female gamete, which leads to advantages in both size and genetic variance of a population.\n\nSexual reproduction therefore must offer significant [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantages because, despite the two-fold cost of sex (see below), it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced by sexual processes outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from [[genetic recombination|recombination]], where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual [[Self-replication|replication]], where the offspring is always identical to the parents (barring mutation). Recombination supplies two [[fault-tolerance]] mechanisms at the molecular level: ''recombinational [[DNA repair]]'' (promoted during [[meiosis]] because [[homologous chromosome]]s pair at that time) and ''[[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]]'' (also known as [[heterosis]], hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).\n\n==Historical perspective==\nThe issue of the evolution of sexual reproduction features in the writings of [[Aristotle]], and modern philosophical-scientific thinking on the problem dates from at least [[Erasmus Darwin]] (1731\u20131802) in the 18th century. [[August Weismann]] picked up the thread in 1889, arguing that sex serves to generate [[genetic variation]], as detailed in the majority of the explanations below. On the other hand, [[Charles Darwin]] (1809\u20131882) concluded that the effect of [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor]] (complementation) \"is amply sufficient to account for the ... genesis of the two sexes\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This is consistent with the repair and complementation hypothesis, described below. Since the emergence of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the 20th century, numerous biologists including [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Alexey Kondrashov]], [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein, Michael M. Cox, Frederic A. Hopf and Richard E. Michod \u2013 have suggested competing explanations for how a vast array of different living species maintain sexual reproduction.\n\n==Disadvantages of sex and sexual reproduction==\nThe paradox of the existence of sexual reproduction is that though it is ubiquitous in multicellular organisms, there are ostensibly many inherent disadvantages to reproducing sexually when weighed against the relative advantages of alternative forms of reproduction, such as asexual reproduction. Thus, because sexual reproduction abounds in complex multicellular life, there must be some significant benefit(s) to sex and sexual reproduction that compensates for these fundamental disadvantages.\n\n==={{anchor|Two-fold cost}}{{anchor|xspeed}}Population expansion cost of sex===\nAmong the most limiting disadvantages to the evolution of sexual reproduction by natural selection is that an asexual population can grow much more rapidly than a sexual one with each generation.\n\nFor example, assume that the entire population of some theoretical species has 100 total organisms consisting of two sexes (i.e. males and females), with 50:50 male-to-female representation, and that only the females of this species can bear offspring. If all capable members of this population procreated once, a total of 50 offspring would be produced (the ''F<sub>1</sub>'' generation). Contrast this outcome with an asexual species, in which each and every member of an equally sized 100-organism population is capable of bearing young. If all capable members of this asexual population procreated once, a total of 100 offspring would be produced \u2013 twice as many as produced by the sexual population in a single generation.\n\n[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates the ''two-fold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]\nThis idea is sometimes referred to as the '''two-fold cost''' of sexual reproduction. It was first described mathematically by [[John Maynard Smith]].<ref name=\"maynard\">{{cite book|authorlink=John Maynard Smith|first = J.

Asexual organisms need not expend the energy necessary to find a mate.\n\n===Selfish cytoplasmic genes===\nSexual reproduction implies that chromosomes and alleles segregate and recombine in every generation, but not all genes are transmitted together to the offspring.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\"/> There is a chance of spreading mutants that cause unfair transmission at the expense of their non-mutant colleagues. These mutations are referred to as \"selfish\" because they promote their own spread at the cost of alternative alleles or of the host organism; they include nuclear meiotic drivers and selfish cytoplasmic genes.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\"/> [[Meiotic drive]]rs are genes that distort meiosis to produce gametes containing themselves more than the 50% of the time expected by chance. A selfish cytoplasmic gene is a gene located in an organelle, plasmid or intracellular parasite that modifies reproduction to cause its own increase at the expense of the cell or organism that carries it.<ref name=\"1946- 2005\"/>\n\n===Genetic heritability cost of sex===\nA sexually reproducing organism only passes on ~50% of its own genetic material to each L2 offspring. This is a consequence of the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are [[haploid]]. Again, however, this is not applicable to all sexual organisms. There are numerous species which are sexual but do not have a genetic-loss problem because they do not produce males or females. Yeast, for example, are [[isogamy|isogamous]] sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid genomes. Both sexes reproduce during the haploid and diploid stages of their life cycle and have a 100% chance of passing their genes into their offspring.<ref name=\"Hoekstra\" />\n\nSome species avoid the 50% cost of sexual reproduction, although they have \"sex\" (in the sense of [[genetic recombination]]). In these species (e.g., [[bacteria]], [[ciliates]], [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[diatom]]s), \"sex\" and reproduction occurs separately.<ref name=\"Ridley M 2004 p. 314\"/><ref>Beukeboom, L. & Perrin, N.

Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].</ref>\n\n==Advantages of sex and sexual reproduction==\nThe concept of sex includes two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation of this information into two parts). Depending on the presence or absence of these phenomena, all of the existing forms of reproduction can be classified as asexual, hermaphrodite or dioecious. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are diametrically opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.\n\nReproductive advantages of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny, and the advantages of the hermaphrodite forms are in maximal diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of at least half of the diversity. So, the primary challenge is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.<ref>Crow J.F. (1994). Advantages of Sexual Reproduction, Dev. Gen., vol.15, pp. 205-213.</ref>\n\n===Advantages due to genetic variation===\n{{See also|Hill\u2013Robertson effect}}\nFor the advantage due to genetic variation, there are three possible reasons this might happen. First, sexual reproduction can combine the effects of two beneficial [[mutation]]s in the same individual (i.e. sex aids in the spread of advantageous traits). Also, the necessary mutations do not have to have occurred one after another in a single line of descendants.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Goldstein\n |first=R N\n |year=2010\n |title=36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction\n |page=\n |publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]\n |isbn=978-0-307-37818-7\n |url=https://archive.org/details/36argumentsforex00gold\n }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}} Second, sex acts to bring together currently deleterious mutations to create severely unfit individuals that are then eliminated from the population (i.e. sex aids in the removal of deleterious genes). However, in organisms containing only one set of chromosomes, deleterious mutations would be eliminated immediately, and therefore removal of harmful mutations is an unlikely benefit for sexual reproduction. Lastly, sex creates new gene combinations that may be more fit than previously existing ones, or may simply lead to reduced competition among relatives.\n\nFor the advantage due to DNA repair, there is an immediate large benefit of removing DNA damage by recombinational [[DNA repair]] during [[meiosis]], since this removal allows greater survival of progeny with undamaged DNA. The advantage of [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] to each sexual partner is avoidance of the bad effects of their deleterious recessive genes in progeny by the masking effect of normal dominant genes contributed by the other partner.\n\nThe classes of hypotheses based on the creation of variation are further broken down below. Any number of these hypotheses may be true in any given species (they are not [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]), and different hypotheses may apply in different species. However, a research framework based on creation of variation has yet to be found that allows one to determine whether the reason for sex is universal for all sexual species, and, if not, which mechanisms are acting in each species.\n\nOn the other hand, the maintenance of sex based on DNA repair and complementation applies widely to all sexual species.\n\n===Protection from major genetic mutation===\nIn contrast to the view that sex promotes genetic variation, Heng,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heng HH | year = 2007 | title = Elimination of altered karyotypes by sexual reproduction preserves species identity | url = | journal = Genome | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 517\u2013524 | pmid = 17612621 | doi=10.1139/g07-039 | first2 = Henry H.Q.| last2 = Heng }}</ref> and Gorelick and Heng<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gorelick R, Heng HH | year = 2011 | title = Sex reduces genetic variation: a multidisciplinary review | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 1088\u20131098 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01173.x | pmid = 21091466 | last2 = Heng }}</ref> reviewed evidence that sex actually acts as a constraint on genetic variation. They consider that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve.\n\n===Novel genotypes===\n[[File:Evolsex-dia2a.svg|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates how sex might create novel genotypes more rapidly. Two advantageous alleles ''A'' and ''B'' occur at random. The two alleles are recombined rapidly in a sexual population (top), but in an asexual population (bottom) the two alleles must independently arise because of [[clonal interference]].]]\nSex could be a method by which novel genotypes are created. Because sex combines genes from two individuals, sexually reproducing populations can more easily combine advantageous genes than can asexual populations. If, in a sexual population, two different advantageous [[alleles]] arise at different loci on a chromosome in different members of the population, a chromosome containing the two advantageous alleles can be produced within a few generations by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. However, should the same two alleles arise in different members of an asexual population, the only way that one chromosome can develop the other allele is to independently gain the same mutation, which would take much longer. Several studies have addressed counterarguments, and the question of whether this model is sufficiently robust to explain the predominance of sexual versus asexual reproduction remains.<ref name=\"Birdsell\"/>{{rp|73\u201386}}\n\n[[Ronald Fisher]] also suggested that sex might facilitate the spread of advantageous genes by allowing them to better escape their genetic surroundings, if they should arise on a chromosome with deleterious genes.\n\nSupporters of these theories respond to the balance argument that the individuals produced by sexual and asexual reproduction may differ in other respects too \u2013 which may influence the persistence of sexuality. For example, in the [[Asexual reproduction#Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction|heterogamous]] [[water flea]]s of the genus ''Cladocera'', sexual offspring form eggs which are better able to survive the winter versus those the fleas produce asexually.\n\n===Increased resistance to parasites===\nOne of the most widely discussed theories to explain the persistence of sex is that it is maintained to assist sexual individuals in resisting [[parasite]]s, also known as the [[Red Queen Hypothesis]].<ref name=\"ridley\">[[Matt Ridley]] 1995 ''The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature'' 1995 Penguin.</ref><ref name=Birdsell>{{cite book | last1 = Birdsell | first1 = JA | last2 = Wills | first2 = C | year = 2003 | title = The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4757-5190-1_2 | journal = Evolutionary Biology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 27\u2013137 | isbn = 978-1-4419-3385-0 }}</ref>{{rp|113\u2013117}}<ref>MacIntyre, Ross J.; Clegg, Michael, T (Eds.), Springer.

If the environment changed sufficiently rapidly (i.e. between generations), these changes in the environment can make sex advantageous for the individual. Such rapid changes in environment are caused by the co-evolution between hosts and parasites.\n\nImagine, for example that there is one gene in parasites with two alleles ''p'' and ''P'' conferring two types of parasitic ability, and one gene in hosts with two alleles ''h'' and ''H'', conferring two types of parasite resistance, such that parasites with allele ''p'' can attach themselves to hosts with the allele ''h'', and ''P'' to ''H''. Such a situation will lead to cyclic changes in allele frequency - as ''p'' increases in frequency, ''h'' will be disfavoured.\n\nIn reality, there will be several genes involved in the relationship between hosts and parasites. In an asexual population of hosts, offspring will only have the different parasitic resistance if a mutation arises. In a sexual population of hosts, however, offspring will have a new combination of parasitic resistance alleles.\n\nIn other words, like [[Lewis Carroll]]'s Red Queen, sexual hosts are continually \"running\" (adapting) to \"stay in one place\" (resist parasites).\n\nEvidence for this explanation for the evolution of sex is provided by comparison of the rate of molecular evolution of genes for [[kinase]]s and [[immunoglobulin]]s in the [[immune system]] with genes coding other [[protein]]s. The genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably faster.<ref name=\"kuma\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kuma | first1 = K. | last2 = Iwabe | first2 = N. | last3 = Miyata | first3 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Functional constraints against variations on molecules from the tissue-level - slowly evolving brain-specific genes demonstrated by protein-kinase and immunoglobulin supergene families | url = | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 123\u2013130 | pmid = 7877487 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040181 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"wolfe\">{{cite journal | author = Wolfe KH, Sharp PM | year = 1993 | title = Mammalian gene evolution - nucleotide-sequence divergence between mouse and rat | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 441\u2013456 | doi = 10.1007/BF00178874 | pmid = 8308912 | last2 = Sharp | bibcode = 1993JMolE..37..441W }}</ref>\n\nFurther evidence for the Red Queen hypothesis was provided by observing long\u2010term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a \"mixed\" (sexual and asexual) population of snails (''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]''). The number of sexuals, the number asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely.

They genetically manipulated the [[mating system]] of ''C. elegans'', causing populations to mate either sexually, by self-fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the ''S. marcescens'' parasite. It was found that the self-fertilizing populations of ''C. elegans'' were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen Hypothesis.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1206360 | last1 = Morran | first1 = Levi T. | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = Olivia G. | last3 = Gelarden | first3 = Ian A. | last4 = Parrish Rc | first4 = Raymond C. | last5 = Lively | first5 = Curtis M. | year = 2011 | title = Running with the Red Queen: Host-Parasite Coevolution Selects for Biparental Sex | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6039 | pages = 216\u2013218 | pmid = 21737739 | pmc = 3402160| bibcode = 2011Sci...333..216M }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110707141158.htm | title = Sex -- As We Know It -- Works Thanks to Ever-Evolving Host-Parasite Relationships, Biologists Find | date = 9 July 2011 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>  In natural populations of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', self-fertilization is the predominant mode of reproduction, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of about 1%.<ref name=\"pmid16005289\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barri\u00e8re A, F\u00e9lix MA |title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

As acknowledged above, however, serious problems with this explanation have led many biologists to conclude that the benefit of sex is a major unsolved problem in evolutionary biology.\n\nAn alternative \"[[information theory|informational]]\" approach to this problem has led to the view that the two fundamental aspects of sex, [[genetic recombination]] and [[outcrossing]], are adaptive responses to the two major sources of \"noise\" in transmitting genetic information. Genetic noise can occur as either physical damage to the genome (e.g. chemically altered bases of DNA or breaks in the chromosome) or replication errors (mutations).<ref name=\"dna-repair\">{{cite journal |author1=Bernstein H |author2=Byerly HC |author3=Hopf FA |author4=Michod RE |title=Origin of sex |journal=J.

Recombinational repair is the only repair process known which can accurately remove double-strand damages in DNA, and such damages are both common in nature and ordinarily lethal if not repaired. For instance, double-strand breaks in DNA occur about 50 times per cell cycle in human cells (see [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|naturally occurring DNA damage]]). Recombinational repair is prevalent from the simplest viruses to the most complex multicellular eukaryotes. It is effective against many different types of genomic damage, and in particular is highly efficient at overcoming double-strand damages. Studies of the mechanism of meiotic recombination indicate that meiosis is an adaptation for repairing DNA.<ref name=\"replication-help\">{{cite journal |author1=Cox MM |title=Historical overview: searching for replication help in all of the rec places |journal=Proc.

[[Outcrossing]], the second fundamental aspect of sex, is maintained by the advantage of masking mutations and the disadvantage of [[inbreeding]] (mating with a close relative) which allows expression of recessive mutations (commonly observed as [[inbreeding depression]]). This is in accord with [[Charles Darwin]],<ref>Darwin CR (1876). The effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881_Worms_F1357/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249.html] see page 462</ref> who concluded that the adaptive advantage of sex is hybrid vigor; or as he put it, \"the offspring of two individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have a great advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one of the same parents.\"\n\nHowever, outcrossing may be abandoned in favor of parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when there has been a forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.\n\nIn the view of the repair and complementation hypothesis, the removal of DNA damage by recombinational repair produces a new, less deleterious form of informational noise, allelic recombination, as a by-product. This lesser informational noise generates genetic variation, viewed by some as the major effect of sex, as discussed in the earlier parts of this article.\n\n==Deleterious mutation clearance==\n[[Mutation]]s can have many different effects upon an organism. It is generally believed that the majority of non-neutral mutations are deleterious, which means that they will cause a decrease in the organism's overall fitness.<ref name=\"Griffiths\">Griffiths ''et al.'' 1999.

Asexual organisms do not have the ability to recombine their genetic information to form new and differing alleles. Once a mutation occurs in the DNA or other genetic carrying sequence, there is no way for the mutation to be removed from the population until another mutation occurs that ultimately deletes the primary mutation. This is rare among organisms. Hermann Joseph Muller introduced the idea that mutations build up in asexual reproducing organisms. Muller described this occurrence by comparing the mutations that accumulate as a ratchet. Each mutation that arises in asexually reproducing organisms turns the ratchet once. The ratchet is unable to be rotated backwards, only forwards. The next mutation that occurs turns the ratchet once more. Additional mutations in a population continually turn the ratchet and the mutations, mostly deleterious, continually accumulate without recombination.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = H.J. | year = 1964 | title = The Relation of Recombination to Mutational Advance | url = | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 2\u20139 | doi=10.1016/0027-5107(64)90047-8| pmid = 14195748 }}</ref> These mutations are passed onto the next generation because the offspring are exact genetic clones of their parent. The genetic load of organisms and their populations will increase due to the addition of multiple deleterious mutations and decrease the overall reproductive success and fitness.\n\nFor sexually reproducing populations, studies have shown that single-celled bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. Passaging a population through a single-celled bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a single-celled bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niklas|first=Karl J.|date=2014-01-01|title=The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity|url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=101|issue=1|pages=6\u201325|doi=10.3732/ajb.1300314|issn=0002-9122|pmid=24363320}}</ref> Further studies using ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high relatedness. Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low relatedness may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to [[kin selection]]. The studies with ''D. discoideum'' showed that conditions of high relatedness resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low relatedness, suggesting the importance of high relatedness to resist mutations from proliferating.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuzdzal-Fick|first=Jennie J.|last2=Fox|first2=Sara A.|last3=Strassmann|first3=Joan E.|last4=Queller|first4=David C.|date=2011-12-16|title=High Relatedness Is Necessary and Sufficient to Maintain Multicellularity in Dictyostelium|journal=Science|language=en|volume=334|issue=6062|pages=1548\u20131551|doi=10.1126/science.1213272|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22174251|bibcode=2011Sci...334.1548K}}</ref>\n\n===Removal of deleterious genes===\n[[File:Synergistic versus antagonistic epistasis.svg|thumb|200px|Diagram illustrating different relationships between numbers of mutations and fitness.

Roberts and Company Publishers.</ref> - each subsequent mutation has a disproportionately large effect on the organism's fitness.]]\nThis hypothesis was proposed by [[Alexey Kondrashov]], and is sometimes known as the ''deterministic mutation hypothesis''.<ref name=\"kondrashov\"/> It assumes that the majority of deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and fitness is known as [[epistasis|''synergistic epistasis'']].\n\nBy way of [[analogy]], think of a [[Automobile|car]] with several minor faults. Each is not sufficient alone to prevent the car from running, but in combination, the faults combine to prevent the car from functioning.\n\nSimilarly, an organism may be able to cope with a few defects, but the presence of many mutations could overwhelm its backup mechanisms.\n\nKondrashov argues that the slightly deleterious nature of mutations means that the population will tend to be composed of individuals with a small number of mutations. Sex will act to [[Genetic recombination|recombine]] these genotypes, creating some individuals with fewer deleterious mutations, and some with more. Because there is a major selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out. In essence, sex compartmentalises the deleterious mutations.\n\nThere has been much criticism of Kondrashov's theory, since it relies on two key restrictive conditions. The first requires that the rate of deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation in order to provide a substantial advantage for sex.

The male partition is suggested to be an \"experimental\" part of the species that allows the species to expand their ecological niche, and to have alternative configurations. This theory underlines the higher variability and higher mortality in males, in comparison to females. This functional partitioning also explains the higher susceptibility to disease in males, in comparison to females and therefore includes the idea of \"protection against parasites\" as another functionality of male sex. Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex was developed in Russia in 1960\u20131980 and was not known to the West till the era of the Internet.

This model suggests that the nucleus originated when the lysogenic virus incorporated genetic material from the archaean and the bacterium and took over the role of information storage for the amalgam. The archaeal host transferred much of its functional genome to the virus during the evolution of cytoplasm, but retained the function of gene translation and general metabolism. The bacterium transferred most of its functional genome to the virus as it transitioned into a [[mitochondria|mitochondrion]].<ref name=\"bell-2001\">{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Viral eukaryogenesis: Was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=251\u2013256 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s002390010215 |pmid=11523012|bibcode=2001JMolE..53..251L }}</ref>\n\nFor these transformations to lead to the eukaryotic cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short [[telomere|telomeric]] repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the [[cytoplasm]]. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"bell-2006\">{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=243 |issue=1 |pages=54\u201363 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.05.015 |pmid=16846615 }}</ref>\n\n[[Meiotic]] division in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus as a result of its inability to enter into the [[lytic cycle]]. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.)<ref name=\"bell-2001\" /> The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.<ref name=\"bell-2006\" />\n\nThe two viruses established in the cell would initiate replication in response to signals from the host cell. A mitosis-like cell cycle would proceed until the viral membranes dissolved, at which point linear chromosomes would be bound together with centromeres. The homologous nature of the two viral centromeres would incite the grouping of both sets into tetrads. It is speculated that this grouping may be the origin of crossing over, characteristic of the first division in modern meiosis. The partitioning apparatus of the mitotic-like cell cycle the cells used to replicate independently would then pull each set of chromosomes to one side of the cell, still bound by centromeres. These centromeres would prevent their replication in subsequent division, resulting in four daughter cells with one copy of one of the two original pox-like viruses. The process resulting from combination of two similar pox viruses within the same host closely mimics meiosis.<ref name=\"bell-2006\" />\n\n===Neomuran revolution===\nAn alternative theory, proposed by [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], was labeled the [[Neomura|Neomuran revolution]]. The designation \"Neomuran revolution\" refers to the appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because they are based on the \"theoretically and empirically\" unsound model of [[molecular clock]]s. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of [[nucleosome]]s. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.<ref name=\"TCSmith\">{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith, Thomas |title=Cell evolution and Earth history: Stasis and revolution |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=969\u20131006 |year=2006 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1842 |pmid=16754610 |pmc=1578732 }}</ref>\n\n{{Wikipedia books|Sex}}{{clear}}\n\n==Questions==\nSome questions biologists have attempted to answer include:\n* Why does sexual reproduction exist, if in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction?<ref name=\"Ridley M 2004 p. 314\">{{cite book|last =Ridley|first= Mark|date= 2003 |title =Evolution|edition = 3rd |publisher = Wiley|page = 314|isbn = 9781405103459}}</ref>\n* Did [[mating type]]s (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) arise as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or did mating types evolve before anisogamy?<ref>T.
