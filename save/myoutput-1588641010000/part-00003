{"title_page": "Knights Templar in popular culture", "text_new": "{{Knights Templar}}\n\nThe original historic [[Knights Templar]] were a Christian [[Military order (society)|military order]], the [[Knights Templar|Order of the Poor Fellow Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon]], that existed from the 12th to 14th centuries to provide warriors in the [[Crusades]]. These men were famous in the high and late [[medieval|Middle Ages]], but the Order was disbanded very suddenly by King [[Philip IV of France]], who took action against the Templars in order to avoid repaying his own financial debts. He accused them of heresy, ordered the arrest of all Templars within his realm, and had many of them burned at the stake. The dramatic and rapid end of the organization led to many stories and legends developing about them over the following centuries. The Order and its members increasingly appear in modern fiction, though most of these references portray the medieval organization inaccurately.\n\nIn modern works, the Templars generally are portrayed as villains, misguided zealots, representatives of an evil secret society,<ref name=\"HC\"/> or as the keepers of a [[Knights Templar legends#Treasure|long-lost treasure]].

Jacques de Molay supposedly cursed [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Pope Clement V]], saying that he would meet them before God before the year was out. Pope Clement died only a month later, King Phillip died later that year in a hunting accident. Further, within a short span of years thereafter each of Phillip's sons died at relatively young ages, resulting in the end of the [[House of Capet]], leading to disputes over succession and [[The Hundred Years' War]] as different factions battled for the throne.\n\nBarber traces this story to a verse chronicle attributed to [[Geoffrey of Paris]] (''La Chronique m\u00e9trique attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 Geffroi de Paris'', ed. A. Div\u00e8rres, Strasbourg, 1956, pp.&nbsp;5711\u20135742).

Robinson argues for the Templar-Masonic connection in his book [http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/reviews/born_in_blood.html Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry], in which he alleges that some French Templars fled to [[Scotland]] after the suppression of the Order, fearing persecution from both Church and state.  He claims they sought refuge with a [[fraternity|lodge]] of Scottish [[stonemason]]s within which they began to teach the virtues of [[chivalry]] and [[vow of obedience|obedience]], using the builders tools as a metaphor; and eventually they began taking in \"[[speculative mason]]s\" (men of other professions) in order to ensure the continuation of the Order. According to Robinson, the Order existed in secret in this form until the formation of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] in 1717. An example of Templar-Masonic transitory symbolism can supposedly be found in [[Rosslyn Chapel]], owned by the first Earls of Rosslyn, a family with well-documented ties to Scottish [[Freemasonry]]; however, Rosslyn Chapel itself dates from at least 100 years after the suppression of the Templars.\n\nThe case is also made in [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]]'s book ''[[The Temple and the Lodge]]''.\n\nHowever, historians Mark Oxbrow, Ian Robertson,<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/45946 \"The Da Vinci Connection\", Sunday Herald, 14 November 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406214240/http://www.sundayherald.com/45946 |date=6 April 2006 }}</ref> Karen Ralls and Louise Yeoman<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh.cfm?id=658952006 \"Historian attacks Rosslyn Chapel for 'cashing in on Da Vinci Code'\", Scotsman.com, 03-May-06]</ref> have each made it clear that the Sinclair family had no connection with the Medieval Knights Templar.

He claimed that he had heard that preceptor of the French Templars, G\u00e9rard de Villiers, had been warned of his imminent arrest. De Villiers had escaped with 50 horses and eighteen galleys. De Ch\u00e2lons' son, Hugues de Ch\u00e2lons, escaped with him carrying the wealth of his uncle, Hugues de Pairaud.<ref>Malcolm Barber, ''The Trial of the Templars'', Cambridge University Press, 1993, p101</ref> In Baigent and Leigh's ''The Temple and the Lodge'', the fleet carried the treasure of the Paris preceptory of the Templars.<ref>Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, ''The Temple and the Lodge'', Arrow, 1998, pp100-101</ref>\n\nScotland became the destination of the fleet over four centuries later, in the claims of George Frederick Johnson, an exiled Jacobite living in Austria. Johnson, however, turned out to be a fraudster who was probably called Johann Samuel Leuchte. After a chequered career based on alchemy and forgery, \"Johnson\" convinced a masonic lodge in [[Jena]] that he possessed the highest secrets of masonry, and having declared the rest of German masonry irregular, brought a surprising amount of lodges under his control. Exposed as a fraud by [[Karl Gotthelf von Hund]] in 1764, he was later apprehended by a previous victim, and spent the rest of his life in prison.<ref name=\"AQC6\">Ladislas de Malczovich, ''A Sketch of the Earlier History of Masonry in Austria and Hungary'', Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, v6, 1893, pp85-91</ref>\n\nHund's initial attraction to Johnson was spurred by a need to find his own superiors. He had been received into the Order of the Temple by high ranking [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] in Paris during 1743, being introduced to [[Charles Edward Stuart]] himself. After the failure of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745 rebellion]], his masters were either in hiding or dead, and had lost interest in maintaining their Templar offshoots, leaving Hund with a depleted ritual book which he had to reconstruct from memory. As Johnson's collection of lodges now looked to him for leadership, the [[Rite of Strict Observance]] was born. Again, the foundation myth alleged that Freemasonry was started by Templar refugees under the protection of Robert the Bruce. This time, they had travelled from France through England disguised as stonemasons, and their use of masonic symbols in their allegories paid tribute to this deception.<ref name=\"AQC6\"/><ref>R. F. Gould, ''A Concise History of Freemasonry''. Gale & Poulden, London 1904, pp 411-414</ref>\n\nUnder Hund's leadership, the Rite of Strict Observance became the most popular branch of Freemasonry in the German states, with lodges all over Continental Europe. However, Hund's continuing inability to produce, or even contact his \"Unknown Superiors\" led to increasing dissatisfaction. Six years after his death, a convent meeting in Wilhelmsbad from 1782 to 1783 finally agreed that Freemasonry had no connection to the Templars, and Strict Observance ceased to exist, most lodges being absorbed into the [[Rectified Scottish Rite]]. For most of the previous two decades, the most common foundation myth among German masons stated that Freemasonry came from the Knights Templar, protected and allowed to flourish in Scotland.<ref>Trevor W.

This appears to be the basis of subsequent tales of Templar involvement at Bannockburn.

They certainly could not spare ships to indulge in world exploration ... [T]he records of the port of La Rochelle show that the Templars were exporting wine by ship. This was not a fleet in any modern sense: again, those would have been transport vessels rather than warships, and the Templars probably hired them as they needed them, rather than buying their own. ... The ships would have been very small by modern standards, too shallow in draught and sailing too low in the water to be able to withstand the heavy waves and winds of the open Atlantic, and suited for use only in the relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf.

Jacques de Molay supposedly cursed [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Pope Clement V]], saying that he would meet them before God before the year was out. Pope Clement died only a month later, King Phillip died later that year in a hunting accident. Further, within a short span of years thereafter each of Phillip's sons died at relatively young ages, resulting in the end of the [[House of Capet]], leading to disputes over succession and [[The Hundred Years' War]] as different factions battled for the throne.\n\nBarber traces this story to a verse chronicle attributed to [[Geoffrey of Paris]] (''La Chronique m\u00e9trique attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 Geffroi de Paris'', ed. A. Div\u00e8rres, Strasbourg, 1956, pp.&nbsp;5711\u20135742).

Robinson argues for the Templar-Masonic connection in his book [http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/reviews/born_in_blood.html Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry], in which he alleges that some French Templars fled to [[Scotland]] after the suppression of the Order, fearing persecution from both Church and state.  He claims they sought refuge with a [[fraternity|lodge]] of Scottish [[stonemason]]s within which they began to teach the virtues of [[chivalry]] and [[vow of obedience|obedience]], using the builders tools as a metaphor; and eventually they began taking in \"[[speculative mason]]s\" (men of other professions) in order to ensure the continuation of the Order. According to Robinson, the Order existed in secret in this form until the formation of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] in 1717. An example of Templar-Masonic transitory symbolism can supposedly be found in [[Rosslyn Chapel]], owned by the first Earls of Rosslyn, a family with well-documented ties to Scottish [[Freemasonry]]; however, Rosslyn Chapel itself dates from at least 100 years after the suppression of the Templars.\n\nThe case is also made in [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]]'s book ''[[The Temple and the Lodge]]''.\n\nHowever, historians Mark Oxbrow, Ian Robertson,<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/45946 \"The Da Vinci Connection\", Sunday Herald, 14 November 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406214240/http://www.sundayherald.com/45946 |date=6 April 2006 }}</ref> Karen Ralls and Louise Yeoman<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh.cfm?id=658952006 \"Historian attacks Rosslyn Chapel for 'cashing in on Da Vinci Code'\", Scotsman.com, 03-May-06]</ref> have each made it clear that the Sinclair family had no connection with the Medieval Knights Templar.

He claimed that he had heard that preceptor of the French Templars, G\u00e9rard de Villiers, had been warned of his imminent arrest. De Villiers had escaped with 50 horses and eighteen galleys. De Ch\u00e2lons' son, Hugues de Ch\u00e2lons, escaped with him carrying the wealth of his uncle, Hugues de Pairaud.<ref>Malcolm Barber, ''The Trial of the Templars'', Cambridge University Press, 1993, p101</ref> In Baigent and Leigh's ''The Temple and the Lodge'', the fleet carried the treasure of the Paris preceptory of the Templars.<ref>Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, ''The Temple and the Lodge'', Arrow, 1998, pp100-101</ref>\n\nScotland became the destination of the fleet over four centuries later, in the claims of George Frederick Johnson, an exiled Jacobite living in Austria. Johnson, however, turned out to be a fraudster who was probably called Johann Samuel Leuchte. After a chequered career based on alchemy and forgery, \"Johnson\" convinced a masonic lodge in [[Jena]] that he possessed the highest secrets of masonry, and having declared the rest of German masonry irregular, brought a surprising amount of lodges under his control. Exposed as a fraud by [[Karl Gotthelf von Hund]] in 1764, he was later apprehended by a previous victim, and spent the rest of his life in prison.<ref name=\"AQC6\">Ladislas de Malczovich, ''A Sketch of the Earlier History of Masonry in Austria and Hungary'', Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, v6, 1893, pp85-91</ref>\n\nHund's initial attraction to Johnson was spurred by a need to find his own superiors. He had been received into the Order of the Temple by high ranking [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] in Paris during 1743, being introduced to [[Charles Edward Stuart]] himself. After the failure of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745 rebellion]], his masters were either in hiding or dead, and had lost interest in maintaining their Templar offshoots, leaving Hund with a depleted ritual book which he had to reconstruct from memory. As Johnson's collection of lodges now looked to him for leadership, the [[Rite of Strict Observance]] was born. Again, the foundation myth alleged that Freemasonry was started by Templar refugees under the protection of Robert the Bruce. This time, they had travelled from France through England disguised as stonemasons, and their use of masonic symbols in their allegories paid tribute to this deception.<ref name=\"AQC6\"/><ref>R. F. Gould, ''A Concise History of Freemasonry''. Gale & Poulden, London 1904, pp 411-414</ref>\n\nUnder Hund's leadership, the Rite of Strict Observance became the most popular branch of Freemasonry in the German states, with lodges all over Continental Europe. However, Hund's continuing inability to produce, or even contact his \"Unknown Superiors\" led to increasing dissatisfaction. Six years after his death, a convent meeting in Wilhelmsbad from 1782 to 1783 finally agreed that Freemasonry had no connection to the Templars, and Strict Observance ceased to exist, most lodges being absorbed into the [[Rectified Scottish Rite]]. For most of the previous two decades, the most common foundation myth among German masons stated that Freemasonry came from the Knights Templar, protected and allowed to flourish in Scotland.<ref>Trevor W.

The ships would have been very small by modern standards, too shallow in draught and sailing too low in the water to be able to withstand the heavy waves and winds of the open Atlantic, and suited for use only in the relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf.
