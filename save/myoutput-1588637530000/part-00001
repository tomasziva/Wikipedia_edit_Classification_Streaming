[[Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney]] disease (ADPKD) is most often diagnosed in adulthood.<ref name=\"etal 2007 26-56\"/>\n\nAnother example of cystic kidney disease is [[Medullary sponge kidney]].\n\n==Types==\n===More Cystic Kidney Diseases===\nCystic kidney disease refers to various conditions relating to the formation of cysts in one or both kidneys. The most common subset is polycystic kidney disease (PKD) which is a genetic anomaly with two subsets, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Causation can be genetic and developmental, while cysts associated with systemic disease can be acquired or malignant. Examples of acquired cystic kidney disease include simple cysts and medullary sponge kidney (MSK). Other types of genetic cystic kidney disease include juvenile nephronophthisis (JNPHP), medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD), and glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD).\n\n===Polycystic Kidney Disease===\nPKD causes numerous cysts to grow in the kidneys. These cysts are filled with fluid and if they grow excessively will lead to kidney damage. Mutations in genes PKD1 and PKD2 are responsible for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Those genes encode for polycystic proteins and mutations regarding those genes are inherited and responsible for the disorders of autosomal recessive or dominant cystic kidney disease. In the United States, more than half a million people have PKD, making it the fourth leading cause of kidney failure. PKD affects all races and genders equally and those with PKD have a possibility of developing cysts in other organs such as liver, pancreas, spleen, ovaries, and large bowel. Usually, such cysts do not impose a problem. Half of patients have no manifestation of symptoms, but symptoms may include: hematuria, back or abdominal pain, or the development of hypertension. The disease is usually manifested before age 30, and  45% develop [[kidney failure]] by age 60.\n\n==Cause==\nThe site for preference for cyst development is the renal tubule.  After growth of a few millimeters has occurred, the cysts detach from the parent tubule, this detachment induced by excessive proliferation of tubular epithelium or excessive fluid secretions.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis includes imaging with ultrasound, CT and/or MRI scan. The least expensive, non-invasive, and most reliable method is ultrasonography but smaller cysts might escape detection . CT scans and MRI scans are able to capture the smaller cysts that cannot be see in an ultrasound, but normal CT scans and MRI scans would only be used as a diagnostic tool for someone at high risk. MRI are used to monitor the development of the cysts and growth of kidneys. Genetic test can be applicable to those who have family history of PKD. Genetic testing is very expensive and sometimes it fails to detect PKD in 15% of people who have it. \n\n=== Antenatal scans ===\nMany forms of cystic kidney disease can be detected in children prior to birth. Abnormalities which only affect one kidney are unlikely to cause a problem with the healthy arrival of a baby. Abnormalities which affect both kidneys can have an effect on the baby's amniotic fluid volume which can in turn lead to problems with lung development. Some forms of obstruction can be very hard to differentiate from cystic renal disease on early scans.<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\">\nFile:Multicystic Dysplastic kidney.svg|Multicystic dysplastic kidney - affects only one side; the other kidney is usually healthy.\nFile:Cystic dysplastic kidney.svg|Cystic dysplasia - can affect one or both kidneys\nFile:Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.svg|Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease\nFile:Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.svg|Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease\nFile:Posterior Urethral Valve.svg|Posterior urethral valves - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans; appearances are due to obstruction not cysts\nFile:Grade 5 Vesico Ureteric Reflux.svg|High grade vesico-ureteric reflux - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans\nFile:Severe pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction.svg|Pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans\n</gallery>\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment is essential to manage the disease and symptoms, therefore to avoid complications. Some of the treatment options include pain medication (except ibuprofen since it worsens kidney disease), low protein and sodium diet, diuretics, antibiotics to treat UTIs, or surgery to drain cysts. In advance, cystic kidney disease renal transplant or dialysis might be necessary.\n\n==Prognosis==\nBy late 70s, almost 50-75% of patients with CKD require dialysis or a kidney transplant. If the patient requires a kidney transplant, kidneys are usually not taken from children due to this disease being hereditary. The cysts and kidney volume is a predictor of the progression of CKD and end-stage renal disease. PKD does not increase the risk for renal cancer, but if renal cancer is developed it is mostly to be bilateral. The most probable cause of death is heart disease, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, or disseminated infection. Some factors that can affect life expectancy are mutated gene type, gender, the age of onset, high blood pressure, proteinuria, hematuria, UTI, hormones, pregnancies, and size of cysts. If risk factors are controlled and the disease is stabilized then the patient's life expectancy can be prolonged greatly.\n\n==References==\n<ref>\"Average Life Expectancy For People With PKD.\" PKD Clinic, www.pkdclinic.org/pkd-prognosis/342.html</ref>\n<ref>\"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) - Genitourinary Disorders.\" Merck Manuals Professional Edition</ref>\n<ref>\"Polycystic Kidney Disease.\" Mayo Clinic, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 6 Mar. 2018</ref>\n<ref>\"Polycystic Kidney Disease.\" The National Kidney Foundation, 3 Feb. 2017</ref>\n<ref>''\"Polycystic Kidney Disease.\" American Kidney Fund, www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/other-kidney-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease.html#what_causes_polycystic_kidney_disease_pkd.''</ref>\n<ref>\"Cystic Diseases of the Kidney Treatment & Management.\" Cystic Diseases of the Kidney Treatment & Management: Medical Care, Surgical Care, 28 Mar. 2017</ref>\n<references>\n<ref name=\"etal 2007 26-56\">{{cite journal|last=Bisceglia|first=M|title=Renal cystic diseases: a review|journal=Advanced Anatomic Pathology|year=2007|issue=13|pages=26\u201356|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Neoplasms 1575-1582\">{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=SC|title=Neoplasms of the upper urinary tract|year=2007|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|pages=1575\u20131582|edition=9|author2=Novick AC |author3=Bukowski RM |editor=Campbell-Walsh Urology}}</ref>\n</references>\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = \n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|Q|61||q|60}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|753.1}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = med\n| eMedicineTopic  = 3189\n| MeshID          = D052177\n| SNOMED CT       = 236439005\n}}\n{{Congenital malformations of urinary system}}\n\n[[Category:Kidney diseases]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new) \n| name            = Cystic kidney disease \n| image           = Simple renal cyst.jpg \n| caption         = Renal cyst \n| \n| pronounce       =  \n| field           =  \n| synonyms        =  \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Cystic kidney disease''' refers to a wide range of [[heredity|hereditary]], developmental, and [[adaptation|acquired conditions]].<ref name=\"etal 2007 26-56\"/> With the inclusion of neoplasms with cystic changes, over 40 classifications and subtypes have been identified.
