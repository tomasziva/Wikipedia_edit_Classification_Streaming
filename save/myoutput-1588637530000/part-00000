Each character offers a glimpse into their day-to-day lives.\n\n* Leslie is leading several committees she created as part of the response to the quarantine.\n* [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben]] ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]), under the influence of cleaning supplies, has decided to make a claymation film based on his board game ''The Cones of Dunshire''.\n* [[Ron Swanson|Ron]] ([[Nick Offerman]]) is in his cabin; he thinks Leslie's daily conversations with him are unnecessary. He later shows that his ex-wife Tammy 2 ([[Megan Mullally]]) has snuck up to his cabin.\n* [[April Ludgate|April]] ([[Aubrey Plaza]]) put her clothes in a bag and randomly pulls out five items to wear each day.\n* [[Andy Dwyer|Andy]] ([[Chris Pratt]]) has locked himself in his shed by accident.\n* [[Chris Traeger|Chris]] ([[Rob Lowe]]) is regularly donating blood due to his extreme health.\n* [[Ann Perkins|Ann]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) has returned to work as a nurse and is isolating herself from Chris and their kids.\n* [[Tom Haverford|Tom]] ([[Aziz Ansari]]) was supposed to be in [[Bali]] as part of a book tour, but it was cancelled.\n* [[Donna Meagle|Donna]] ([[Retta]]) expresses support for teachers after seeing what her husband has been going through.\n* [[Jerry Gergich|Garry]] ([[Jim O'Heir]]), whom the others had avoided calling, explains the challenges he's faced as mayor of [[Pawnee (Parks and Recreation)|Pawnee]].\n\nLeslie and Ben make an appearance on Joan Callamezzo's ([[Mo Collins]]) talk show.

Andy makes an appearance on Perd's show as his character Johnny Karate to reassure kids about the situation. Fictional advertisements show several other characters:\n\n* Dennis Feinstein ([[Jason Mantzoukas]]) promotes a cologne that supposedly kills all viruses but seems unsafe.\n* Jeremy Jamm ([[Jon Glaser]]) announces that he is starting \"home dental delivery\" (i.e. delivering dental equipment to houses and then walking the patient through whatever procedure they need).\n* Jean-Ralphio Saperstein ([[Ben Schwartz]]) has just won a settlement and uses the money to run a commercial showing his phone number so people can call him because he's bored.\n\nLeslie tells Ron that despite her daily calls, she still misses her friends. To cheer her up, Ron arranges for the others to join a group call, and they sing \"5,000 Candles in the Wind\" for her. Leslie thanks Ron for the gesture.\n\n==Production==\nIn April 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], [[NBC]] announced they would air a special episode of the series, centered on Leslie trying to stay connected with the other residents of Pawnee [[Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic|during social distancing]].
