A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]]. Assam has always been a historically tribal state.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|Sanskritisation and Detribalisation in early Assam|2008|pp=116}}</ref>\n\nAhoms along with [[Chutia people|Chutia]], Moran, Motok, and Koch are still regarded as semi-tribal groups who have nominally converted to Ekasarana Dharma even though keeping alive their own tribal traditions and customs. Various [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] in Assam like Chutiya, [[Rajbongshi people|Koch-Rajbongshi]], Moran, Motok, Ahoms etc (all having tribal origin) have slowly been converted into a caste through [[Sanskritisation]].\n\nAs per latest development indigenous ethnicities like ''Moran'', ''Chutia'', ''Motok'', ''Tai Ahoms'' and ''Koch'' & also non-indigenous<ref>{{Cite document | url=https://www.academia.edu/25822076 |title = Tea Tribes of Assam: Colonial Exploitation and Assertion of Adivasi Rights|last1 = Das|first1 = N.

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam.

The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]].
