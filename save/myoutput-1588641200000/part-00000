While, it is a civilian award, it can also be awarded to military officers of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistan Defence Forces]] worn on their uniform for recognition of their services to the country. Like other awards, it is a highly restricted and prestigious award only given to those who have done great services to the country. It is one of the most distinguished civil decorations to the civilians who have made outstanding contribution in their respected fields such as literature, arts, sports, medicine, or science, which prompted the recognition of the country on international level. It is given to a person who has accomplished duty beyond what is assigned to him/her. To receive this honour, the individuals are expected to show eminence and be outstanding in providing excellent service in a significant field of activity beyond what they are assigned to.\n\nFor officers in the military, it is given after distinguished service, and is also the highest medal that can be awarded to those at the rank of [[Brigadier-General]] or [[Major-General]] in the ([[Pakistan Army|Army]]), [[Air Commodore|Air-Commodore]]s or [[Air Vice-Marshal]]s in the ([[Pakistan Air Force|Air Force]]) and [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] or [[Rear-Admiral]] in the ([[Pakistan Navy|Navy]], [[Pakistan Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], and [[Pakistan Marines|Marines]]). The [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]'s Committee for Award and Recognition Services for State of Pakistan, selects the names of individuals and sends final report to the [[Prime minister of Pakistan]]. On advice of the Prime minister, the President organizes a colorful ceremony that is telecast and broadcast by the [[Pakistan Television Corporation]]. The award is usually given to individuals one by one and not in groups because the whole purpose of the award is to assess the recipient's individual capabilities in par excellence.\n\nThe award is a disc of golden [[Jasminum officinale|Jasminum]] which stands between two and five points of the star, and is also of pure gold. The star is in the form of a five pointed star, with additional bright coloured Jasminum filling in space between points of the star. In the middle of the star, a well polished green emerald circumference fills the inside of the golden star. A smaller golden star is situated in the middle of the emerald field.\n\nA special grade of the medal/award has larger execution of the same medal design worn as a star on the left chest. In addition, it is worn as a sash on the right shoulder, with its rosette [yellow with white (for civilians) or/ green (for military officers only) with white and yellow edge, bearing the central disc of the medal at its centre] resting on the left hip. At the formal ceremony, both medals can be worn at the same time depending upon the individual's achievements. The medal is suspended on a ribbon, dark green colour with a light yellow and white central stripe with white edge stripes.\n\n== Recipients of Sitara-i-Imtiaz ==\n* Dr. Ayub Khan Ommaya (1981)\n*Dr. A.Q Mughal <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/37482-services-of-prof-mughal-lauded|title=Services of Prof Mughal lauded|website=www.thenews.com.pk|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://habib.edu.pk/board-governors/dr-mughal/|title=Dr. A.
