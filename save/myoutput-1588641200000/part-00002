Grubhub Holdings'' ====\nThe ''Wallace v. Grubhub Holdings'' contractor lawsuit alleges that Carmen Wallace and Broderick Bryant and other drivers were misclassified as independent contractors and Grubhub defied wage-and-hour requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Illinois Minimum Wage Law, and the California Labor Code.\n\nThe plaintiffs in ''Wallace v. Grubhub'' claim that the work of these drivers makes them employees rather than independent contractors. Wallace and Bryant argue that drivers work on scheduled shifts, and must work in certain area. \"The drivers as a general matter cannot engage in personal non-work activities during their GrubHub shifts,\" the complaint states, meaning that they essentially function as employees. They also allege that they do not receive the same benefits that an employee does. Grubhub drivers are allegedly required to pay some of their own expenses. Because of how they are paid, the plaintiffs claim they may often paid below federal or state minimum wage, even when they work long hours. Many drivers allegedly work more than 40 hours a week but do not receive overtime rates for their work.\n\nAccording to the Grubhub contractor lawsuit, the company violated a number of FLSA and Illinois laws by failing to pay overtime and failing to pay minimum wage. The plaintiffs filed their class-action Grubhub contractor lawsuit on June 29, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nMisclassifying workers like Grubhub delivery drivers as independent contractors may allow a company to avoid paying minimum wage, overtime pay, health benefits, insurance, and social security costs. Workers improperly classified in this manner may feel the need to take Grubhub and other companies in court and pursue litigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/851439-grubhub-contractor-lawsuit-filed-over-failure-to-pay-proper-wages/|title=GrubHub Contractor Lawsuit Filed Over Failure to Pay Proper Wages|date=2018-07-31|website=Top Class Actions |language=en-US |access-date=2019-06-29}}</ref>\n\nBroderick and Carmen filed the lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all others in a similar situation and the case is ongoing.\n\n===Phone fees===\nIn 2019, the company was sued for charging restaurants fees for phone calls taking place on Grubhub-issued phone lines lasting over 45 seconds\u2014whether they resulted in orders or not. Grubhub agreed to extend the refund window for restaurants that have been unwittingly charged for phantom orders.

Grubhub Holdings'' ====\nThe ''Wallace v. Grubhub Holdings'' contractor lawsuit alleges that Carmen Wallace and Broderick Bryant and other drivers were misclassified as independent contractors and Grubhub defied wage-and-hour requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Illinois Minimum Wage Law, and the California Labor Code.\n\nThe plaintiffs in ''Wallace v. Grubhub'' claim that the work of these drivers makes them employees rather than independent contractors. Wallace and Bryant argue that drivers work on scheduled shifts, and must work in certain area. \"The drivers as a general matter cannot engage in personal non-work activities during their GrubHub shifts,\" the complaint states, meaning that they essentially function as employees. They also allege that they do not receive the same benefits that an employee does. Grubhub drivers are allegedly required to pay some of their own expenses. Because of how they are paid, the plaintiffs claim they may often paid below federal or state minimum wage, even when they work long hours. Many drivers allegedly work more than 40 hours a week but do not receive overtime rates for their work.\n\nAccording to the Grubhub contractor lawsuit, the company violated a number of FLSA and Illinois laws by failing to pay overtime and failing to pay minimum wage. The plaintiffs filed their class-action Grubhub contractor lawsuit on June 29, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nMisclassifying workers like Grubhub delivery drivers as independent contractors may allow a company to avoid paying minimum wage, overtime pay, health benefits, insurance, and social security costs. Workers improperly classified in this manner may feel the need to take Grubhub and other companies in court and pursue litigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/851439-grubhub-contractor-lawsuit-filed-over-failure-to-pay-proper-wages/|title=GrubHub Contractor Lawsuit Filed Over Failure to Pay Proper Wages|date=2018-07-31|website=Top Class Actions |language=en-US |access-date=2019-06-29}}</ref>\n\nBroderick and Carmen filed the lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all others in a similar situation and the case is ongoing.\n\n===Phone fees===\nIn 2019, the company was sued for charging restaurants fees for phone calls taking place on Grubhub-issued phone lines lasting over 45 seconds\u2014whether they resulted in orders or not. Grubhub agreed to extend the refund window for restaurants that have been unwittingly charged for phantom orders. The restaurants themselves must review and audit call logs within the refund window in order to identify and dispute fees erroneously charged to them by Grubhub's algorithm.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dugan |first1=Kevin |last2=Fickenscher |first2=Lisa |title=GrubHub extends refunds for fake fees amid pressure from Schumer |url=https://nypost.com/2019/08/01/grubhub-extends-refunds-for-fake-fees-amid-pressure-from-schumer/ |website=New York Post |language=en |date=1 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Grubhub charging us even when our customers don't order: restaurant owners |url=https://nypost.com/2019/05/19/grubhub-is-charging-us-even-when-our-customers-dont-order-lawsuit/ |website=www.nypost.com |accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Referral numbers on Yelp listings===\nReporting from an August 2019 episode of podcast Underunderstood found that Yelp listings for some restaurants provide Grubhub \"referral numbers\" which, when called instead of the restaurant's phone number itself, facilitate recording of the calls and can result in the restaurant being charged commission fees, even in some cases when resulting in no order.<ref>{{cite web |title=Recorded for Awesomeness |url=https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/yelp-grubhub-dark-pattern/ |publisher=Underunderstood |accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Cybersquatting ===\nIn June 2019, reports came out alleging that Grubhub had registered more than 23,000 web domains in restaurants' names without their consent, in what was cast as \"an attempt to generate greater commission revenue and prevent restaurants from building their own online presences.\" Grubhub disputed the allegations, insisting that restaurants had explicitly agreed in their contracts with Grubhub to allow web domain purchases and the creation of websites advertising their businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecounter.org/grubhub-domain-purchases-thousands-shadow-sites/|title=GrubHub is buying up thousands of restaurant web addresses.
