Ice boats typically have the least resistance to forward motion of any sailing craft;<ref name = Kimball/> consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sail boats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where it's possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind.<ref name=Jobson/>\n\nFor a sailboat, point of sail significantly affects the lateral force to which the boat is subjected. The higher the boat points into the wind, the stronger the lateral force, which results in both increased leeway and heeling.  Leeway, the effect of the boat moving sideways through the water, can be counteracted by a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and rudder. Lateral force also induces heeling in a sailboat, which is resisted by the shape and configuration of the hull (or hulls, in the case of catamarans) and the weight of ballast, and can be further resisted by the weight of the crew. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become reduced.<ref name=Marchaj1>\n{{Citation\n | last = Marchaj\n | first = C.

Apparent wind velocity provides the motive power for the sails on any given point of sail. It varies from being the true wind velocity of a stopped craft in irons in the no-go zone to being faster than the true wind speed as the sailing craft's velocity adds to the true windspeed on a reach, to diminishing towards zero, as a sailing craft sails dead downwind.<ref name=Jobson2>{{cite book | last = Jobson | first = Gary | title = Championship Tactics: How Anyone Can Sail Faster, Smarter, and Win Races | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-312-04278-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/championshiptact00jobs/page/323 323] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/championshiptact00jobs/page/323 }}</ref>\n<center>\n;Effect of apparent wind on sailing craft at three points of sail\nSailing craft '''A''' is close-hauled.

Ice boats typically have the least resistance to forward motion of any sailing craft;<ref name = Kimball/> consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sail boats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where it's possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind.<ref name=Jobson/>\n\nFor a sailboat, point of sail significantly affects the lateral force to which the boat is subjected. The higher the boat points into the wind, the stronger the lateral force, which results in both increased leeway and heeling.  Leeway, the effect of the boat moving sideways through the water, can be counteracted by a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and rudder. Lateral force also induces heeling in a sailboat, which is resisted by the shape and configuration of the hull (or hulls, in the case of catamarans) and the weight of ballast, and can be further resisted by the weight of the crew. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become reduced.<ref name=Marchaj1>\n{{Citation\n | last = Marchaj\n | first = C.
