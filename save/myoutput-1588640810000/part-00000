He took part in the defense of Itter Castle against troops of the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division]] \"G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen\" with soldiers of the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[United States Army|US Army]] and lost his life in the process.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://riddip.com/the-battle-for-schloss-itter|title=The Battle for Schloss Itter|date=2018-11-09|website=Richard Pendavingh|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Youth ===\nJosef Gangl was born in 1910 in [[Obertraubling]], Bavaria, the son of a small official of the [[Royal Bavarian State Railways]] and a former shop assistant. When he was a toddler, the family moved to [[Pei\u00dfenberg]] in Upper [[Bavaria]], where Josef's younger siblings were born.\n\n=== Reichswehr ===\nOn November 1, 1928, Gangl joined the [[Reichswehr]], which was then limited to 100,000 men, in order to begin a career as a professional soldier in Artillery Regiment 7 in [[Nuremberg]]. He stayed there until September 1929, in order to serve in Artillery Regiment 5 in [[Ulm]].\n\n=== Wehrmacht ===\nIn 1935 he came to the newly established 25th Artillery Regiment in [[Ludwigsburg]] and married the Ludwigsburg saleswoman Walburga Renz, with whom he later had two children: in 1936, the daughter Sieglinde was born.\n\nIn November 1938, Gangl was promoted to sergeant major. From October 1939 he was an officer school of the [[Wehrmacht]] visit, but he was in the context of preparations for war with his regiment in the Saar-Palatinate on the border with France. There, on September 7, 1939, eleven French divisions, 25 km wide, crossed the border and advanced about 8 km into German territory, but withdrew on [[Maurice Gamelin|Gamelin's]] orders within two weeks. This was Gangl's first combat. In the following months of the \"[[Phoney War]]\" Gangl spent six months in hospitals. On May 14 1940, he returned to his regiment and took part in the western campaign. There he served as the commander of a reconnaissance unit of the 25th Infantry Division of the [[Wehrmacht]]. After the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne he was instructor in the artillery replacement department 25 and in August 1940 after a short home leave at its base in Taus in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. On November 25 1940, he began a one-month training at the artillery school in [[J\u00fcterbog]].\n\nIn June 22 1941, Gangl took the motorized artillery regiment 25 as part of [[Army Group South]] in the [[Ukraine]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], where he, in the battle for Kiev in the 3rd Battalion, commanded a battery with 105mm howitzers. On August 20 1941, Gangl was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 2nd class]]. In January 1942 he was promoted to first lieutenant and on February 12 1942 he received the Iron Cross 1st Class. On April 24 1942, Gangl became the commander of a fog launcher- Unit in the 25th Artillery Regiment. He held this position on the Eastern Front until in January 1944 he was assigned as commander of the [[Nebelwerfer]] replacement and training department 7 in [[H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau]]. In February he went to the army school for battalion and division leaders in [[Antwerp]] for a month. On March 4, 1944, Gangl was sent to the new Werfer-Regiment 83 in Celle, which belonged to Werfer-Brigade 7. With this he marched to France in May 1944. After the [[Invasion of Normandy|Allied invasion of Normandy]], he marched with the Werfer-Brigade to Caen on June 7 1944, where it was placed under the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division]] \"[[Hitler Youth]]\" and played an important role in the defense of the city. The Werfer-Brigade 7 escaped from the Falaise basin with heavy losses in August. In November it was reorganized in Pr\u00fcm in the Eifel as Volks-Werfer-Brigade 7 with new equipment. Sepp Gangl participated with the brigade in the [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]], in the subsequent general retreat and in February 1945 in the unsuccessful defense of [[Saarbr\u00fccken]] . On March 8 1945, he was awarded the [[German Cross#Divisions| German Cross in Gold]]. Shortly afterwards he was promoted to major and received command of the 2nd division of Werfer-Regiment 83. Werfer-Brigade 7 had meanwhile lost half of its men and no longer had any ''nebelwerfer'' equipment. Their commander, General [[Kurt Paape]], ordered the commanders of his battalions near Pei\u00dfenberg to fight their way to Tyrol with them and take part in the defense of the Alpine fortress . In mid-April Gangl met with Lieutenant General [[Georg Ritter von Hengl]], who assigned him and the remnants of his association to the Giehl combat group under Lieutenant Colonel [[Johann Giehl]] in [[W\u00f6rgl]].\n\n=== Resistance in Austria ===\nA few days after his arrival in [[W\u00f6rgl]], Gangl contacted the local group of Austrian resistance under [[Alois Mayr]]. He provided the resistance fighters with information and weapons. It was decided that the execution of [[Johann Giehl]]'s order to defend W\u00f6rgl against the Americans to the end, to break bridges and block paths, should be prevented, and furthermore to free prominent French prisoners from the nearby [[Itter Castle]]. On May 3, 1945, however, parts of the Giehl combat group in Niederaudorf were attacked by the [[12th Armored Division (United States)|12th US Armored Division]] and suffered heavy casualties. Von Hengl had his troops withdrawn from [[W\u00f6rgl]] and [[Itter]], whereupon units of the [[Waffen-SS|Waffen SS]] moving up. In the meantime, many residents of W\u00f6rgl had already hung white flags out of the windows. According to an order from [[Heinrich Himmler]], all male residents of such a house were shot. Gangl, like Mayr, saw it as his obligation to stay in place to protect the residents from reprisals with his soldiers. Together with ten comrades from Thrower Regiment 83, he remained in W\u00f6rgl against Hengls' order to withdraw.\n\nOn May 4, 1945 at 11 a.m., the Czech cook Andreas Krobot appeared at Gangl, coming by bike from [[Itter Castle]], and asked for immediate help for the prisoners there, since an attack by the Waffen SS on the castle was imminent. Gangl, who did not want to sacrifice his men in an Ascension Command and had promised to get them through alive, was forced to run towards the white-flagged Americans and ask for help. In [[Kufstein]], 8 km away, he met an American reconnaissance unit under the command of Captain [[John C. \"Jack\" Lee]]. This ultimately moved with 14 US soldiers and Gangl and ten of his former artillerymen to [[Itter Castle]], where it was the battle for Itter Castle the possibly only warfare of World War II came, in which soldiers of the US Army and the Wehrmacht fought side by side. Gangl called Alois Mayr again for help, whereupon two other [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers and the young resistance fighter [[Hans Waltl]] drove to the castle. The freed French prisoners also took part in the fight. On the morning of May 5, about 100 to 150 men from the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division]] \"G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen\" attacked. Gangl was fatally hit by a sniper while trying to get former French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] out of the line of fire. He died as the only defender of the castle. Around 4:00 p.m., a relief unit from the [[142nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|142nd US Infantry Regiment]] reached the castle and defeated the besiegers, capturing about 100 SS men.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* [[Iron Cross]] II Class on August 20, 1941\n* [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class on February 12, 1942\n* [[German Cross|German cross]] in gold on March 8, 1945\n\n== Posthumous honors ==\nGangl was honored as a hero of the Austrian resistance.
