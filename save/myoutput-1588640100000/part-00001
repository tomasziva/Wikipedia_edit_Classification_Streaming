A mosquito causes an infection by a bite. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect [[liver cells]], where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and return to the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts that in turn produce further merozoites. [[Gametocytes|Sexual forms]] are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, infects the insect and continue the life cycle.]]\n\nIn the [[Plasmodium#\u00acif cycle|life cycle]] of ''Plasmodium'', a female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito (the [[host (biology)|definitive host]]) transmits a motile infective form (called the [[sporozoite]]) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where it reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] (tissue [[schizogony]]), producing thousands of [[merozoite]]s. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA70 70\u20131]}}</ref>\n\nOther merozoites develop into immature [[Gametocyte#Gametocytes and malaria|gametocytes]], which are the precursors of male and female [[gamete]]s. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an [[ookinete]]\u2014a fertilized, motile [[zygote]]. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's [[salivary gland]]s, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.<ref name=\"Cowman 2012\"/>\n\nOnly female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus ''Anopheles'' prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed.<ref name=\"Arrow 2004\"/> Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.<ref name=\"Owusu-Ofori 2010\"/>\n\n===Recurrent malaria===\nSymptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either [[recrudescence]], [[relapse]], or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=vi}}</ref> Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|hypnozoites]] in liver cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=MB|title=Malaria: Origin of the Term \"Hypnozoite\"|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|date=2011|volume=44|issue=4|pages=781\u201386|doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9239-3|pmid=20665090|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22a9a94fd803f97d7d145d7fa529b96a7177b8ed}}</ref> Relapse commonly occurs between 8\u201324 weeks and is often seen in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections.<ref name=\"Nadjm 2012\"/> However, relapse-like ''P. vivax'' recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation.

When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8\u201330 days.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nAfter a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the [[cell membrane]] of the infected host liver cell.<ref name=\"Vaughan 2008\"/>\n\nWithin the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nSome ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7\u201310 months is typical) to several years.<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' infections,<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> although their existence in ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' is uncertain.<ref name=\"Richter 2010\"/>\n\nThe parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name=\"Tilley 2011\"/> The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria.<ref name=\"Mens 2010\"/> Sequestered red blood cells can breach the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and cause cerebral malaria.<ref name=\"R\u00e9nia 2012\"/>\n\n===Genetic resistance===\n{{Main|Human genetic resistance to malaria}}\nAccording to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria\u2014especially the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' species\u2014it has placed the greatest [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.<ref name=\"Kwiatkowski 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hedrick 2011\"/>\n\nThe impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow [[capillaries]]; however, when the modified [[hemoglobin S|hemoglobin&nbsp;S]] molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are [[homozygous]] (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta [[allele]]) have [[sickle-cell anaemia]], while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia.

This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.]]\n\nMethods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no [[malaria vaccine|vaccine for malaria]]. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.<ref name=\"whqlibdoc\"/>\n\nPrevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the [[capital cost|initial costs]] required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China\u2014whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the [[Chinese province]]s\u2014the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.<ref name=\"Sabot 2010\"/>\n\nIn areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have [[anemia]], which is sometimes due to malaria.

Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people.

In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of [[pesticide resistance|resistant]] mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be compared to [[antibiotic resistance]] shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.<ref name=\"van den Berg 2009\"/> Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound [[Paris Green]] to places with standing water.<ref name=\"Killeen 2002\"/>\n\n[[Malaria vaccine]]s have been an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuator (genetics)|attenuated]] sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites.

In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.<ref name=\"Sachs 2002\"/>\n\nPoverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.<ref name=\"Greenwood 2005\"/> The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30\u201350% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of [[outpatient]] visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.<ref name=\"Roll Back Malaria WHO\"/>\n\n[[File:Malaria Patient, Nyangaton, Ethiopia (15151075077).jpg|thumb|Child with malaria in [[Ethiopia]]]]\nCerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.<ref name=\"Idro 2010\"/> Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.<ref name=\"Fernando 2010\"/> Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching [[socioeconomic]] consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.<ref name=\"Ricci 2012\"/>\n\n===Counterfeit and substandard drugs===\nSophisticated [[counterfeit drugs|counterfeits]] have been found in several Asian countries such as [[Cambodia]],<ref name=\"Lon 2006\"/> [[People's Republic of China|China]],<ref name=\"Newton 2008\"/> [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]], and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries.<ref name=\"Newton 2006\"/> The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater [[Mekong]] region.

H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at [[Royal Army Medical College]] in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: \"The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era.&nbsp;... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin.\"<ref name=\"Ross 1910\"/> In British-occupied India the cocktail [[Gin and tonic#History|gin and tonic]] may have come about as a way of taking quinine, known for its antimalarial properties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Bronwen Jean |last2=Knights |first2=Kathleen Mary |title=Pharmacology for Health Professionals |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Australia |isbn=9780729539296 |page=895 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TQV6sLzYsOYC&pg=PA895 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMalaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during [[World War II]], where about 500,000 men were infected.<ref name=\"Bray 2004\"/> According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, \"Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.\"<ref name=\"Byrne 2008\"/>\n\nSignificant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new anti-malarial agents. During [[World War I]] and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural anti-malaria drugs [[cinchona bark]] and quinine prompted substantial funding into [[research and development]] of other drugs and vaccines. American military organizations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], and the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] of the US Armed Forces.<ref name=\"malariasite1\"/>\n\nAdditionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], or CDC) established in 1946. According to the CDC, MCWA \"was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Eradication efforts===\n[[File:Members of the Malaria Commission on the Danube delta, 1929 Wellcome L0011626.jpg|thumb|Members of the Malaria Commission of the [[League of Nations]] collecting larvae on the [[Danube delta]], 1929]]\nSeveral notable attempts are being made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world, or to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate it worldwide]].

Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions.

Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce [[antibodies]] in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.<ref name=\"Cromptom 2010\"/> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.<ref name=\"Graves 2006b\"/> For example, [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo|SPf66]] was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.<ref name=\"Graves 2006\"/>\n\n===Medications===\nMalaria parasites contain [[apicoplast]]s, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own [[genome]]s. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]] of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite [[metabolism]], such as [[fatty acid biosynthesis]]. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.<ref name=\"Kalanon 2010\"/>\n\nWith the onset of drug-resistant ''Plasmodium'' parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic [[pyridoxal]]-amino acid [[adduct]]s, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential [[B vitamin]]s.<ref name=\"M\u00fcller 2010\"/><ref name=\"Du 2011\"/> Antimalarial drugs using [[Organometallic chemistry|synthetic metal-based]] [[coordination complex|complexes]] are attracting research interest.<ref name=\"Biot 2012\"/><ref name=\"Roux 2012\"/>\n* (+)-SJ733: Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called [[spiroindolone]].

Advances in [[genetic engineering]] technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. [[Sterile insect technique]] is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released.

''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections, and every three days ([[Fever#Types|quartan fever]]) for ''P.&nbsp;malariae''. ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection can cause recurrent fever every 36\u201348 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.<ref name=\"Ferri 2009\"/>\n\nSevere malaria is usually caused by ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' (often referred to as falciparum malaria).

A mosquito causes an infection by a bite. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect [[liver cells]], where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and return to the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts that in turn produce further merozoites. [[Gametocytes|Sexual forms]] are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, infects the insect and continue the life cycle.]]\n\nIn the [[Plasmodium#\u00acif cycle|life cycle]] of ''Plasmodium'', a female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito (the [[host (biology)|definitive host]]) transmits a motile infective form (called the [[sporozoite]]) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where it reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] (tissue [[schizogony]]), producing thousands of [[merozoite]]s. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA70 70\u20131]}}</ref>\n\nOther merozoites develop into immature [[Gametocyte#Gametocytes and malaria|gametocytes]], which are the precursors of male and female [[gamete]]s. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an [[ookinete]]\u2014a fertilized, motile [[zygote]]. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's [[salivary gland]]s, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.<ref name=\"Cowman 2012\"/>\n\nOnly female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus ''Anopheles'' prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed.<ref name=\"Arrow 2004\"/> Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.<ref name=\"Owusu-Ofori 2010\"/>\n\n===Recurrent malaria===\nSymptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either [[recrudescence]], [[relapse]], or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=vi}}</ref> Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|hypnozoites]] in liver cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=MB|title=Malaria: Origin of the Term \"Hypnozoite\"|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|date=2011|volume=44|issue=4|pages=781\u201386|doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9239-3|pmid=20665090|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22a9a94fd803f97d7d145d7fa529b96a7177b8ed}}</ref> Relapse commonly occurs between 8\u201324 weeks and is often seen in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections.<ref name=\"Nadjm 2012\"/> However, relapse-like ''P. vivax'' recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation.

When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8\u201330 days.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nAfter a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the [[cell membrane]] of the infected host liver cell.<ref name=\"Vaughan 2008\"/>\n\nWithin the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nSome ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7\u201310 months is typical) to several years.<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' infections,<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> although their existence in ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' is uncertain.<ref name=\"Richter 2010\"/>\n\nThe parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name=\"Tilley 2011\"/> The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria.<ref name=\"Mens 2010\"/> Sequestered red blood cells can breach the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and cause cerebral malaria.<ref name=\"R\u00e9nia 2012\"/>\n\n===Genetic resistance===\n{{Main|Human genetic resistance to malaria}}\nAccording to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria\u2014especially the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' species\u2014it has placed the greatest [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.<ref name=\"Kwiatkowski 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hedrick 2011\"/>\n\nThe impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow [[capillaries]]; however, when the modified [[hemoglobin S|hemoglobin&nbsp;S]] molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are [[homozygous]] (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta [[allele]]) have [[sickle-cell anaemia]], while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the [[heterozygote advantage|benefits]] provided by the heterozygous form.<ref name=\"Hedrick 2011\"/><ref name=\"Weatherall 2008\"/>\n\n===Liver dysfunction===\nLiver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as [[viral hepatitis]] or [[chronic liver disease]]. The syndrome is sometimes called ''malarial hepatitis''.<ref name=\"Bhalla 2006\"/> While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India.

The [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of blood films ranges from 75\u201390% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%.

This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.]]\n\nMethods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no [[malaria vaccine|vaccine for malaria]]. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.<ref name=\"whqlibdoc\"/>\n\nPrevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the [[capital cost|initial costs]] required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China\u2014whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the [[Chinese province]]s\u2014the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.<ref name=\"Sabot 2010\"/>\n\nIn areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have [[anemia]], which is sometimes due to malaria.

In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of [[pesticide resistance|resistant]] mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be compared to [[antibiotic resistance]] shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.<ref name=\"van den Berg 2009\"/> Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound [[Paris Green]] to places with standing water.<ref name=\"Killeen 2002\"/>\n\n[[Malaria vaccine]]s have been an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuator (genetics)|attenuated]] sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites.

In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.<ref name=\"Sachs 2002\"/>\n\nPoverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.<ref name=\"Greenwood 2005\"/> The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30\u201350% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of [[outpatient]] visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.<ref name=\"Roll Back Malaria WHO\"/>\n\n[[File:Malaria Patient, Nyangaton, Ethiopia (15151075077).jpg|thumb|Child with malaria in [[Ethiopia]]]]\nCerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.<ref name=\"Idro 2010\"/> Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.<ref name=\"Fernando 2010\"/> Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching [[socioeconomic]] consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.<ref name=\"Ricci 2012\"/>\n\n===Counterfeit and substandard drugs===\nSophisticated [[counterfeit drugs|counterfeits]] have been found in several Asian countries such as [[Cambodia]],<ref name=\"Lon 2006\"/> [[People's Republic of China|China]],<ref name=\"Newton 2008\"/> [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]], and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries.<ref name=\"Newton 2006\"/> The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater [[Mekong]] region.

H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at [[Royal Army Medical College]] in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: \"The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era.&nbsp;... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin.\"<ref name=\"Ross 1910\"/> In British-occupied India the cocktail [[Gin and tonic#History|gin and tonic]] may have come about as a way of taking quinine, known for its antimalarial properties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Bronwen Jean |last2=Knights |first2=Kathleen Mary |title=Pharmacology for Health Professionals |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Australia |isbn=9780729539296 |page=895 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TQV6sLzYsOYC&pg=PA895 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMalaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during [[World War II]], where about 500,000 men were infected.<ref name=\"Bray 2004\"/> According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, \"Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.\"<ref name=\"Byrne 2008\"/>\n\nSignificant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new anti-malarial agents. During [[World War I]] and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural anti-malaria drugs [[cinchona bark]] and quinine prompted substantial funding into [[research and development]] of other drugs and vaccines. American military organizations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], and the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] of the US Armed Forces.<ref name=\"malariasite1\"/>\n\nAdditionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], or CDC) established in 1946. According to the CDC, MCWA \"was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Eradication efforts===\n[[File:Members of the Malaria Commission on the Danube delta, 1929 Wellcome L0011626.jpg|thumb|Members of the Malaria Commission of the [[League of Nations]] collecting larvae on the [[Danube delta]], 1929]]\nSeveral notable attempts are being made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world, or to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate it worldwide]].

Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions.

Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce [[antibodies]] in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.<ref name=\"Cromptom 2010\"/> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.<ref name=\"Graves 2006b\"/> For example, [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo|SPf66]] was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.<ref name=\"Graves 2006\"/>\n\n===Medications===\nMalaria parasites contain [[apicoplast]]s, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own [[genome]]s. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]] of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite [[metabolism]], such as [[fatty acid biosynthesis]]. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.<ref name=\"Kalanon 2010\"/>\n\nWith the onset of drug-resistant ''Plasmodium'' parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic [[pyridoxal]]-amino acid [[adduct]]s, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential [[B vitamin]]s.<ref name=\"M\u00fcller 2010\"/><ref name=\"Du 2011\"/> Antimalarial drugs using [[Organometallic chemistry|synthetic metal-based]] [[coordination complex|complexes]] are attracting research interest.<ref name=\"Biot 2012\"/><ref name=\"Roux 2012\"/>\n* (+)-SJ733: Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called [[spiroindolone]].

Advances in [[genetic engineering]] technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. [[Sterile insect technique]] is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released.
