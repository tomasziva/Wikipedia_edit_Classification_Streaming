That awful day\n:Yet leaves its trace. The waters find their way,\n:Now laughing in the sun - now swallowed up\n:In caverns pervious to their course alone,\n:They leave their channel dry, and hide awhile\n:Their silent flow; like bitter tears, unshed\n:From the dim eye, before a careless world\n:Unheeding of our grief; but swelling still\n:In the full heart, which leaves unsoothed, unseen,\n:And broods o'er ruined hopes, and days gone by.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Tributaries==\nThe major tributaries of the River Mole are the Ifield Brook, [[Gatwick Stream]], Earlswood Brook, [[Pipp Brook]] and [[The Rye (brook)|The Rye]], which drains [[Ashtead]].
