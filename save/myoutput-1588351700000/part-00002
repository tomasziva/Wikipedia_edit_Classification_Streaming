The first three were co-authored with his friend and fellow journalist William Montalbano: ''Powder Burn'' (1981), ''Trap Line'' (1982), and ''A Death in China'' (1984). His first solo novel, ''[[Tourist Season (novel)|Tourist Season]]'' (1986), featured a group of ragged eco-warriors who kidnap the [[Orange Bowl]] Queen in Miami.

His work has been translated into 34 languages.\n\nHis first venture into writing for younger readers was the 2002 novel ''[[Hoot (novel)|Hoot]]'', which was named a [[Newbery Medal]] honor book. It was [[film adaptation|adapted]] as a [[Hoot (film)|2006 film of the same name]] (starring [[Logan Lerman]], [[Brie Larson]] and [[Luke Wilson]]).  The movie was written and directed by [[Wil Shriner]].

All of Hiaasen's books for young readers feature environmental themes, eccentric casts and adventure-filled plots. His newest, ''[[Squirm (novel)|Squirm]],''  which is set in Florida and Montana, was published in the fall of 2018 and opened at #4 on the New York Times bestseller list for middle-grade novels.\n\nHis most recent novel for adults, ''Razor Girl,'' was published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in September 2016, and opened at #2 on the New York Times bestseller list. In England it was short-listed for the [[Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize|Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse]] award for comic fiction. His new novel, ''Squeeze Me,'' will be published in August 2020.\n\nHiaasen's most recent nonfiction work is ''Assume the Worst: The Graduation Speech You'll Never Hear'', which was published in April 2018 and illustrated by Roz Chast, who is well-known for her cartoons in the ''New Yorker'' magazine.\n\nDuring the 1990s Hiaasen co-wrote the lyrics of three songs with his good friend and famed L.A. rocker, the late [[Warren Zevon]]. \"Rottweiler Blues\" and \"Seminole Bingo\" appeared on Zevon's ''[[Mutineer (album)|Mutineer]]'' album in 1995.

The third song they wrote together, \"Basket Case,\" was done in conjunction with Hiaasen's novel of the same name, and appeared in 2001 on Zevon's album ''[[My Ride's Here]].''\n\n== Works ==\n{{library resources box|by=yes|viaf= 2519004}}\n\n=== Fiction ===\n==== Adult fiction ====\n\n*''[[Tourist Season (novel)|Tourist Season]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Double Whammy (novel)|Double Whammy]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Skin Tight (novel)|Skin Tight]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Native Tongue (Carl Hiaasen novel)|Native Tongue]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Strip Tease (novel)|Strip Tease]]'' (1993) (filmed in 1996 as ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' by [[Andrew Bergman]], starring [[Demi Moore]] and [[Burt Reynolds]])<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web |title=Biography |publisher=Carl Hiaasen's Official Website |url=http://www.carlhiaasen.com/bio.html |accessdate=2008-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064130/http://www.carlhiaasen.com/bio.html |archivedate=2008-10-11 }}</ref>\n* ''[[Stormy Weather (novel)|Stormy Weather]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Naked Came the Manatee]] '' (1996) (A Mystery Thriller Parody with 12 other authors)\n* ''[[Lucky You (novel)|Lucky You]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Sick Puppy]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Basket Case (novel)|Basket Case]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Skinny Dip (novel)|Skinny Dip]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Nature Girl (novel)|Nature Girl]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Star Island (novel)|Star Island]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Bad Monkey (novel)|Bad Monkey]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Razor Girl (novel)|Razor Girl]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Squeeze Me (novel)|Squeeze Me]]'' (2020)\n\n'''With William Montalbano'''\n* ''Powder Burn'' (1981)\n* ''Trap Line'' (1982)\n* ''A Death in China'' (1984)\n\n==== Fiction for young readers ====\n* ''[[Hoot (novel)|Hoot]]'' (2002)  (released as a [[Hoot (film)|movie]] in May 2006 by director [[Wil Shriner]])<ref name=\"bio\" />\n* ''[[Flush (novel)|Flush]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Scat (novel)|Scat]]'' (2009) \n* ''[[Chomp (novel)|Chomp]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Skink - No Surrender]]'' (2014) (young adult novel featuring a recurring hero from his adult fiction series)\n*''Squirm'' (2018)\n\n=== Short stories ===\n* \"Tart of Darkness\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Carl Hiaasen |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1028052/index.htm |title=A crazed photographer has kidnapped a beautiful model and - 02.18.03 - SI Vault |publisher=Vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2003-02-18 |accessdate=2012-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304062230/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1028052/index.htm |archivedate=2009-03-04 }}</ref> (2003, ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'')\n* The Edible Exile (2013)\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\n* ''Assume the Worst: The Graduation Speech You'll Never Hear (2018)''\n* ''[[Team Rodent|Team Rodent: How Disney Devours the World]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Kick Ass (Carl Hiaasen collection)|Kick Ass]]'': Selected Columns  (1999)\n* ''Paradise Screwed: Selected Columns'' (2001)\n* ''The Downhill Lie'' (2008)\n* ''Dance of the Reptiles: Selected Columns'' (2014)\n\n=== Collections ===\n* ''A Carl Hiaasen'' (2000) (an audiobook set containing ''[[Tourist Season]]'', ''[[Stormy Weather (Carl Hiaasen novel)|Stormy Weather]]'', and ''[[Strip Tease (book)|Strip Tease]]'')\n\n== Awards and achievements ==\n\n;Journalist\n* 1980: National Headliners Award from Sigma Delta Chi.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://db12.linccweb.org/login?url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=true&displayGroupName=Biographies&currPage=&scanId=&query=&prodId=BIC1&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&mode=view&catId=&limiter=&display-query=&displayGroups=&contentModules=&action=e&sortBy=&documentId=GALE%7CH1000045246&windowstate=normal&activityType=&failOverType=&commentary=true&source=Bookmark&u=lincclin_ircc&jsid=a3adbb4980cd6071beb90ac32020d1fc|title=Carl Hiaasen|last=|first=|publisher=Contemporary Authors Online|year=2014|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=|via=Biography in Context}}</ref>\n* 1980: Heywood Broun Award from Newspaper Guild.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1997|others=Ed.
