Its principal product, ZL UA, is used by enterprises to consolidate all unstructured data into a single repository for the purposes of information governance\u2014i.e. [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]], [[legal discovery]], [[records management]], file analysis. ZL Tech' global headquarters is in Milpitas, California, and has international offices in Dublin, Ireland; Tokyo, Japan; and Hyderabad, India.<ref>http://www.zlti.com/company/about-us</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nZL Tech was originally established as ZipLip in 1999, a secure mail carrier that provided tracking, security, and authentication services. Its first customers were telecommunications firms, large organizations that required a robust architecture in order to govern their hundreds of thousands of email inboxes. In 2000, ZipLip's secure email and data tracking capabilities expanded to provide secure file share and collaboration tools for enterprise users, and in 2001 the telecom market experienced a [[dot-com bubble|bubble]], forcing ZipLip to shift its focus to large enterprise customers. Additionally in the early 2000s, the regulatory and legal landscape underwent major changes\u2014such as the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]\u2014and in response ZipLip expanded its focus to the newly invigorated requirements for regulatory compliance, accommodating the ingestion, archiving, and long-term governance of business communications. In 2006 the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP)]] were amended to include [[Electronically stored information (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure)|electronically stored content (ESI)]] as a type of discoverable content, and ZipLip expanded its product to include [[Electronic discovery|eDiscovery]] functionalities to accommodate the new regulation.\n\nIn 2007, the company changed its name from ZipLip to ZL Technologies. In 2008 ZL Tech added [[records management]] functionality in response to a growing focus by companies on file management. The additions allowed ZL Tech to build a business model that encompasses both archiving and data management needs of large enterprises such as those in the [[Fortune 500]]. By 2012, ZL Tech incorporated feature updates in the eDiscovery module and added advanced [[SharePoint]], [[Documentum]], and file share analysis features.\n\n==Products==\nZL Tech' core product \u2014 ZL UA, is an enterprise archive and an interface platform for extension modules, like Discovery Manager, Compliance Manager, Records Manager, and File Analysis and Management. ZL's storage management software implements [[single-instance storage]] to remove additional copies of data and offline access.\n\n== Awards and Recognition ==\nZL Tech was named a leader within the enterprise information archiving space, according to [[Gartner, Inc.]] in 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019,\n<ref>http://www.zlti.com/press-releases/zl-technologies-positioned-leader-gartner-magic-quadrant-enterprise-information-archiving/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.cmswire.com/cms/information-management/gartner-names-6-leaders-in-resurgent-information-archiving-space-027305.php/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/12/14/mimecast_gets_gartner_enterprise_info_archiving_mq_crown/</ref><ref>https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/21/1950820/0/en/ZL-Technologies-Named-a-Leader-in-Gartner-Magic-Quadrant-for-Enterprise-Information-Archiving.html</ref>\nand was named a visionary by Gartner in 2015, 2016.\n<ref>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/13/gartner_magic_quadrant_information_archive/</ref><ref>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/22/storage_roundup/</ref>\n<ref>http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=2618017&ref='g_fromdoc'</ref>\n2019 marks ZL a record of 15 continuous appearances in Gartner [[Magic Quadrant]] for Enterprise Information Archiving Report.\n<ref>https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/21/1950820/0/en/ZL-Technologies-Named-a-Leader-in-Gartner-Magic-Quadrant-for-Enterprise-Information-Archiving.html</ref>\nIn 2018, ZL Tech won the Gold Stevie Award in International Business Awards for its GDPR solutions.\n<ref>https://gdpr.report/news/2018/08/10/zl-technologies-wins-gold-stevie-award-in-2018-international-business-awards-for-its-gdpr-solutions/</ref>\nIn 2019, ZL Technologies was the Gold Winner for Enterprise Information Archiving in the 14th Annual Network PG\u2019s IT World Awards.\n<ref>https://networkproductsguide.com/winners/2019-it-world-awards/</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!-- This article uses [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]].
