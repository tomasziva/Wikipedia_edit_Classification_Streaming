The game was published by [[SNK]] in Japan in 1999, and by [[Infogrames]] internationally in 2000. Set in the haunted Nemeton Monastery in [[Wales]], the plot follows protagonists Koudelka Iasant, [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Edward Plunkett]] and Bishop James O'Flaherty as they uncover Nemeton's secrets and confront monsters created from its dark past. Its gameplay blends exploration and puzzle elements with turn-based battles waged on a grid.\n\n''Koudelka'' was created by [[Hiroki Kikuta]], a former employee of [[Square (video game company)|Square]] who formed Sacnoth with other Square staff members in 1997 to develop the game. Kikuta was its director, producer, writer and composer. The staff travelled to Wales for research, and all dialogue was spoken in English. The traditional turn-based battle system was created without Kikuta's involvement, due to staff disputes. The game, which received mixed reviews from critics, was the foundation of Sacnoth's ''[[Shadow Hearts]]'' series.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Koudelka screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A woman in dark clothing, Koudelka Iasant, fights a monster in a dark battle arena holding a pistol.|The main protagonist, Koudelka, in the game's opening battle.]]\n''Koudelka'' is a [[role-playing video game]] (RPG) set in the fictional Nemeton Mansion. Controlling Koudelka Iasant, the main protagonist, the player explores Nemeton. Gameplay is divided between event scenes, in which story sequences play; exploration, incorporating puzzle-solving; and a battle screen where players fight monsters spawned in Nemeton.<ref name=\"KoudelkaManuel\"/> Exploration is similar to the early ''[[Resident Evil]]'' games; Koudelka\u2014rendered as a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] character model\u2014explores environments created with [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds shown through fixed camera angles.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/> Items and weapons are found in the environment or gained after a battle, with the number of items which can be carried limited.<ref name=\"KoudelkaManuel\"/><ref name=\"RPGFreview\"/>\n\nCombat is triggered through [[random encounter]]s, with battles governed by a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based system]]. The three playable characters and the enemy are positioned on a grid, able to move to a new square and perform an action with each turn. Each party has access to physical and magical attacks and other abilities, such as status effects, healing magic and the ability to escape from battle. Each player character can equip any of a variety of weapons, which break after being used a number of times. At the end of each successful battle, the party gains [[experience point]]s (raising their experience level) and ability points (to increase attributes, such as agility and speed). Depending on usage, weapons and abilities increase in power as their skill level rises with use.<ref name=\"KoudelkaManuel\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/><ref name=\"GSreview\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn 1898, near [[Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]], [[Romani people|Romani]] psychic Koudelka Iasant (Vivianna Bateman)<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> is drawn to Nemeton. A former medieval monastery, it was converted into a mansion and is now infested with monsters. Koudelka breaks into Nemeton, losing her magic pendant in the process, and saves wayward adventurer Edward Plunkett (Michael Bradberry)<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> from a monster attack. They are offered hospitality by the mansion's caretakers, Ogden (Gavin Carlton)<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> and Bessy Hartman (Denise White).<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> Their food is poisoned, and Koudelka\u2014having detected the poison and refused to eat\u2014cures Edward. Exploring Nemeton, they meet Catholic bishop James O'Flaherty (Scott Larson);<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> James refuses to believe that the Hartmans are responsible for the deaths, since they did not try to poison him.<ref name=\"KoudelkaCharacters\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaBook\"/> They also encounter the ghost of Charlotte D'lota ([[Sara Paxton]]),<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> a young girl who was executed in Nemeton, and are attacked by an intruder named Alias (Rob Brownstein).<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc1\"/> From visions, human remains and confiscated artefacts, Koudelka learns that Nemeton was a prison for dissidents that now haunt the mansion.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc1\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc2\"/>\n\nThey learn from Alias that he survived the Hartmans' attempt to kill him and the mansion's monsters, and saw the Hartmans kill anyone who trespassed in the mansion. Admitting that he tried to kill them to keep Nemeton's treasures for himself, Edward kills Alias because he is a threat. Koudelka discovers a room full of paintings of the destroyed [[SS Princess Alice (1865)|SS ''Princess Alice'']] and has a vision of Elaine Heyworth ([[Kim Weild]]),<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> wife of current owner Patrick (Keith Barry).<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> The group finds the apparently-dead [[Roger Bacon]] (Brian Kojac),<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> who briefly revives and mentions the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document, in the library. James says that he was sent by the Vatican to recover the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document, a book of Celtic rituals to gain immortality and revive the dead.<ref name=\"Koudelka\u00c9migr\u00e9\"/> James was asked by the Hartmans to save Patrick, who stole the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document. Koudelka is separated from the group when a monster attacks them,<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc2\"/> and finds the room where Ogden killed his victims. Ogden captures her and rants about his guilt for the ''Princess Alice'' disaster, but Bessy shoots him before he can kill Koudelka. Before shooting herself, Bessy explains that Odgen killed intruders to avenge Elaine, who was killed by a thief.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc3\"/>\n\nAfter meeting Bacon and rejoining the others, Koudelka decides that something else was driving the Hartmans and spawning the monsters. James says that he and Patrick courted Elaine, but James' social background prevented a marriage and he joined the church to ease his pain. Confronted by Charlotte, Koudelka finds letters written by Charlotte's mother which Charlotte never received; learning that her mother loved her, Charlotte passes on. The group rejoins Bacon, who achieved imperfect immortality after learning the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document's secrets while copying it for the Vatican. Koudelka summons Elaine's spirit, and they learn that Patrick used the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document to resurrect Elaine; they resurrected her body as a monster, which caused the events at the mansion. Elaine\u2014who summoned Koudelka to aid her\u2014asks them to destroy her body so her spirit can be free. Bacon tells the group how to do this, in a section of Nemeton which has been converted into a temple.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc3\"/>\n\nThe three enter the temple and find Patrick's body. James destroys the temple, starting a fire which begins consuming the building.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc4\"/> Depending on the player's actions, three different endings are unlocked. If Koudelka does not regain her pendant, they are killed when they confront Elaine and the game is over. If she finds the pendant, Koudelka uses it to block Elaine's attack and they are cornered in the mansion's bell tower. If the party defeats Elaine, they contemplate the situation as the sun rises over the ruined mansion. If Elaine defeats them, James sacrifices himself to destroy Elaine, and Koudelka and Edward escape the collapsing tower. After spending the night together they part, although Koudelka believes that they will meet again.<ref name=\"KoudelkaBook\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc4\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Hiroki Kikuta @ MAGFest 9 (crop).jpg|thumb|alt=A bespectacled Hiroki Kikuta, in a plaid shirt and a stocking cap|Hiroki Kikuta (pictured in 2011) was heavily involved in the game's development, acting as producer, director, writer and composer.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/>]]\n''Koudelka'' was created by [[Hiroki Kikuta]], who composed ''[[Secret of Mana]]'', ''[[Seiken Densetsu 3]]'' and ''[[Soukaigi]]'' at [[Square (video game company)|Square]].<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> Kikuta wanted to direct his own game, but Square's corporate structure prevented him from moving beyond a composer.<ref name=\"StingInterview1\"/> Searching for a way to expand his role, Kikuta was introduced to the chairman of [[SNK]]; during their talk, he outlined many perceived pitfalls in the role-playing genre.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> Leaving Square, he formed [[Sacnoth]] in 1997 with other Square employees and SNK's funding.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/><ref name=\"SacnothBeginning\"/><ref name=\"SNKsacnoth\"/> As Sacnoth's CEO and the game's main creative lead, Kikuta wanted to create a [[Horror game|horror]] RPG. ''Koudelka'' began development after Sacnoth was founded, and Kikuta was its producer, director, writer and composer.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/><ref name=\"StingInterview1\"/>\n\nAlthough ''Koudelka'' used turn-based combat on a grid and random encounters (similar to traditional RPGs), this was not Kikuta's original intention. He originally planned a real-time battle system with free movement within the environment, combining mechanics from [[Simulation video game|simulation]] and [[adventure game]]s. Interactive environments, such as furniture, were also planned to play a part in combat.<ref name=\"StingInterview2\"/> Kikuta wanted to break away from RPG conventions, but other Sacnoth staff were reluctant to follow his example and retained traditional ideas from Square. Kikuta later regretted his lack of direct influence on the game design.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> About the battle-system design, art director Matsuzo Machida (credited as Matsuzo Itakura<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/><ref name=\"SHinterview\"/><ref name=\"ShadowDengeki\"/>) said that it was designed to be easy so adults who did not normally play games could see the game's ending; in hindsight, the team could have increased the challenge.<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/>\n\nThe game had English voice work for all characters, with Japan using native subtitles rather than a Japanese dub.<ref name=\"KoudelkaEnglish\"/> To create an authentic atmosphere, Kikuta used advanced [[motion capture]] technology to give realistic physical mannerisms to the character models during cutscenes.<ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/> Kikuta's decision to use motion capture, which he called \"epoch-making\", was part of his attempt to move away from RPG conventions by adding drama. The story required the capture of up to four people in each scene, impossible with technology available in Japan. Through the original staff of ''Soukaigi'', Kikuta contacted [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]-based special-effects company [[VisionArt|FutureLight]]. Intrigued by Kikuta's concept, FutureLight agreed to help record the cutscenes.<ref name=\"KoudelkaMocap\"/> In a later interview, he said that the techniques used for the motion-capture sessions were on a par with those used by [[Hollywood]] studios at the time.<ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/>\n\nThe game's cast provided motion capture and character voices. They were chosen from 100 actors who auditioned for the roles, including the twelve-year-old Sara Paxton as Charlotte.<ref name=\"KoudelkaMocap\"/> Vivianna Bateman, who played Koudelka, was chosen to give her character a cool, \"unique\" air. Kikuta called Edward's actor, Michael Bradberry, the \"mood maker\" for recording.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/> The motion-capture sessions took place in January 1998 at FutureLight's local studios. The motion capture and animation processes were handled by FutureLight and Sacnoth staff, with Kikuta the sessions' executive producer. Rehearsals, supervised by Kikuta, were held in a nearby hotel. The recording sessions were in a converted sound studio; since the studio was not fully soundproofed, recording was sometimes halted due to exterior noises. Equipment around the soundstage was used as props for the actors, so the in-game immersion would not be broken.<ref name=\"KoudelkaMocap\"/>\n\n===Scenario and art design===\nAccording to Kikuta, his research for the narrative and the basic elements of ''Koudelka'' took three months;<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/> the one-night timescale and singular location were due to the game's limited staff and development time.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog2\"/> Aberystwyth was chosen because he wanted a location across the sea from Ireland.<ref name=\"KoudelkaNemeton\"/> Due to a lack of Japanese resources on British architecture, Kikuta and several staff members made a research trip to [[Pembrokeshire]] to see local scenery and church architecture. The region's coastal cliffs, ancient ruins and weather conditions influenced ''Koudelka''{{'s}} setting and design.<ref name=\"StingInterview1\"/><ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaNemeton\"/> Kikuta's choice of 1898 was influenced by his wish for a story blending realism and fantasy; the end of the 19th century symbolised, to him, the intermingling of superstition and the next century's technological advances.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/> Kikuta wanted to explore the uneasy coexistence of magic and science in the game.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog2\"/> He bought over 100 books on British history during his research, from the medieval to the Victorian eras. His inspirations for the story included [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (and its [[The Name of the Rose (film)|film adaptation]]), [[William Hope Hodgson]]'s ''[[Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder]]'', [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'' and novels by [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]].<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> ''Koudelka''{{'s}} setting and story were primarily inspired by ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder''.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/> Kikuta incorporated a number of historical events and figures, including the sinking of the ''Princess Alice'' and fictionalized versions of Lord Dunsany and Roger Bacon. Charlotte's mother was based on [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]].<ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/> The story also included references to Celtic, Irish and Welsh mythology and folklore.<ref name=\"KoudelkaBook\"/>\n\nIts characters were designed by [[Y\u016bji Iwahara]], who created over 100 character sketches for the game.<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/> The visuals were inspired by the work of [[Bob Carlos Clarke]], [[Jan Saudek]] and Holly Warburton.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> Koudelka was among the first elements of the game created by Kikuta, with Iwahara's first character drafts created in March 1998. Koudelka's given name was taken from photographer [[Josef Koudelka]]; Kikuta liked its mysterious sound and lack of any specific ethnic origin. Kikuta's wish for a lonely character resulted in Koudelka's background as an exiled gypsy. Her design required several redrafts to be carried over into the game, which had severe polygon and memory restrictions.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/> Machida's design of Nemeton was intended to compress the variety of a typical RPG world map into a limited exploration space and permit detailed backgrounds within the console's hardware limitations. Nemeton used a blend of architectural styles, with elements ranging from its origins as a Gothic monastery (inspired by [[St Davids]]) to contemporary additions.<ref name=\"KoudelkaNemeton\"/> Koudelka's CGI model was created by Sacnoth and a company founded by artist Nobuji Watanabe, whom Kikuta chose for his passion for good work. The model went through multiple redrafts, with Kikuta making adjustments.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/>\n\nIn creating ''Koudelka''{{'s}} storyline, Kikuta conceived a potential four-part series following her family through the 20th century with events and themes from the original clash of science and magic. In the first sequel, Koudelka would attend the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]; the second would move to [[Chicago]] in 1973 during the late [[Vietnam War]] and follow Koudelka's grandson, Rodmell, through an [[urban fantasy]] scenario. In the third, Rodmell would travel to [[Kyoto]] in 1984, where magic and modern life were still closely connected.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/><ref name=\"KikutaBlog2\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|Music of the Shadow Hearts series}}\nKikuta found composing the score the easiest part of development, since he primarily worked on his own. His concept for ''Koudelka''{{'s}} musical elements were created with the setting and narrative.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> The score was arranged by Kikuta and [[Nick Ingman]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaLiners\"/> To compose the most of the game's tracks, Kikuta used [[Logic Pro|Atari Notator]] sound software. While he found lack of compression an issue, the better sequencing software was useful in creating the score for the CGI cutscenes.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog3\"/> With less music than the average RPG, the score was completed within six months.<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/> Instead of the looping tracks of Kikuta's work with Square, ''Koudelka'' used ambient sounds and short tracks related to cutscenes outside battle themes, and featured influences from [[church music]]. Its opening theme \"Requiem\" was performed by [[Catherine Bott]]. The ending theme \"Ubi Caritas et amor\"\u2014taken from a [[Quatre Motets sur des th\u00e8mes gr\u00e9goriens|larger composition]] by [[Maurice Durufl\u00e9]]\u2014was performed by the [[London Oratory School]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaLiners\"/>\n\nA CD soundtrack album was released in December 1999 by [[Pony Canyon]] and [[Scitron Digital Contents]], with over an hour of music and 34 tracks.<ref name=\"KikutaBlogAlbum\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaAudioB\"/> The album, which included all tracks from the game and live versions of three battle themes (arranged by Naoya Akimoto),<ref name=\"KoudelkaLiners\"/> received generally-positive reviews from music critics.<ref name=\"RPGFKoudelkaOST\"/><ref name=\"VGMOKoudelkaOST\"/> Its music was praised<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/><ref name=\"GSreview\"/> and criticized by reviewers of the game.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGFreview\"/><ref name=\"PowerReview\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Koudelka'' and its publisher, SNK, were first announced in September 1999.<ref name=\"KoudelkaAnnounced\"/> As part of its marketing campaign, a music CD and promotional poster were offered as pre-order bonuses.<ref name=\"KoudelkaInfo\"/> The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1999,<ref name=\"KoudelkaDates\"/> and was scheduled for a Western release by [[Electronic Arts]].<ref name=\"KoudeklaWest1\"/> It was later announced that [[Infogrames]] would publish the title in North America and Europe.<ref name=\"KoudelkaWest2\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaSteam\"/> It was released overseas in 2000: on June 29 in North America,<ref name=\"KoudelkaDates\"/> and September 27 in Europe.<ref name=\"KoudelkaUKdate\"/> In addition to the PlayStation version, Sacnoth were reportedly developing a version for the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaNeo\"/> Console Classics announced plans in 2015 to port ''Koudelka'' to [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaSteam\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Media adaptations}}Adaptations===\nThe first of a three-volume manga adaptation, written and illustrated by Iwahara, was published in November 1999 by [[Kadokawa Shoten]];

The game was published by [[SNK]] in Japan in 1999, and by [[Infogrames]] internationally in 2000. Set in the haunted Nemeton Monastery in [[Wales]], the plot follows protagonists Koudelka Iasant, [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Edward Plunkett]] and Bishop James O'Flaherty as they uncover Nemeton's secrets and confront monsters created from its dark past. Its gameplay blends exploration and puzzle elements with turn-based battles waged on a grid.\n\n''Koudelka'' was created by [[Hiroki Kikuta]], a former employee of [[Square (video game company)|Square]] who formed Sacnoth with other Square staff members in 1997 to develop the game. Kikuta was its director, producer, writer and composer. The staff travelled to Wales for research, and all dialogue was spoken in English. The traditional turn-based battle system was created without Kikuta's involvement, due to staff disputes. The game, which received mixed reviews from critics, was the foundation of Sacnoth's ''[[Shadow Hearts]]'' series.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Koudelka screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A woman in dark clothing, Koudelka Iasant, fights a monster in a dark battle arena holding a pistol.|The main protagonist, Koudelka, in the game's opening battle.]]\n''Koudelka'' is a [[role-playing video game]] (RPG) set in the fictional Nemeton Mansion. Controlling Koudelka Iasant, the main protagonist, the player explores Nemeton. Gameplay is divided between event scenes, in which story sequences play; exploration, incorporating puzzle-solving; and a battle screen where players fight monsters spawned in Nemeton.<ref name=\"KoudelkaManuel\"/> Exploration is similar to the early ''[[Resident Evil]]'' games; Koudelka\u2014rendered as a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] character model\u2014explores environments created with [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds shown through fixed camera angles.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/> Items and weapons are found in the environment or gained after a battle, with the number of items which can be carried limited.<ref name=\"KoudelkaManuel\"/><ref name=\"RPGFreview\"/>\n\nCombat is triggered through [[random encounter]]s, with battles governed by a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based system]]. The three playable characters and the enemy are positioned on a grid, able to move to a new square and perform an action with each turn. Each party has access to physical and magical attacks and other abilities, such as status effects, healing magic and the ability to escape from battle. Each player character can equip any of a variety of weapons, which break after being used a number of times. At the end of each successful battle, the party gains [[experience point]]s (raising their experience level) and ability points (to increase attributes, such as agility and speed). Depending on usage, weapons and abilities increase in power as their skill level rises with use.<ref name=\"KoudelkaManuel\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/><ref name=\"GSreview\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn 1898, near [[Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]], [[Romani people|Romani]] psychic Koudelka Iasant (Vivianna Bateman)<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> is drawn to Nemeton. A former medieval monastery, it was converted into a mansion and is now infested with monsters. Koudelka breaks into Nemeton, losing her magic pendant in the process, and saves wayward adventurer Edward Plunkett (Michael Bradberry)<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> from a monster attack. They are offered hospitality by the mansion's caretakers, Ogden (Gavin Carlton)<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> and Bessy Hartman (Denise White).<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> Their food is poisoned, and Koudelka\u2014having detected the poison and refused to eat\u2014cures Edward. Exploring Nemeton, they meet Catholic bishop James O'Flaherty (Scott Larson);<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> James refuses to believe that the Hartmans are responsible for the deaths, since they did not try to poison him.<ref name=\"KoudelkaCharacters\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaBook\"/> They also encounter the ghost of Charlotte D'lota ([[Sara Paxton]]),<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> a young girl who was executed in Nemeton, and are attacked by an intruder named Alias (Rob Brownstein).<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc1\"/> From visions, human remains and confiscated artefacts, Koudelka learns that Nemeton was a prison for dissidents that now haunt the mansion.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc1\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc2\"/>\n\nThey learn from Alias that he survived the Hartmans' attempt to kill him and the mansion's monsters, and saw the Hartmans kill anyone who trespassed in the mansion. Admitting that he tried to kill them to keep Nemeton's treasures for himself, Edward kills Alias because he is a threat. Koudelka discovers a room full of paintings of the destroyed [[SS Princess Alice (1865)|SS ''Princess Alice'']] and has a vision of Elaine Heyworth ([[Kim Weild]]),<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> wife of current owner Patrick (Keith Barry).<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> The group finds the apparently-dead [[Roger Bacon]] (Brian Kojac),<ref name=\"KoudelkaCredits\"/> who briefly revives and mentions the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document, in the library. James says that he was sent by the Vatican to recover the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document, a book of Celtic rituals to gain immortality and revive the dead.<ref name=\"Koudelka\u00c9migr\u00e9\"/> James was asked by the Hartmans to save Patrick, who stole the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document. Koudelka is separated from the group when a monster attacks them,<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc2\"/> and finds the room where Ogden killed his victims. Ogden captures her and rants about his guilt for the ''Princess Alice'' disaster, but Bessy shoots him before he can kill Koudelka. Before shooting herself, Bessy explains that Odgen killed intruders to avenge Elaine, who was killed by a thief.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc3\"/>\n\nAfter meeting Bacon and rejoining the others, Koudelka decides that something else was driving the Hartmans and spawning the monsters. James says that he and Patrick courted Elaine, but James' social background prevented a marriage and he joined the church to ease his pain. Confronted by Charlotte, Koudelka finds letters written by Charlotte's mother which Charlotte never received; learning that her mother loved her, Charlotte passes on. The group rejoins Bacon, who achieved imperfect immortality after learning the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document's secrets while copying it for the Vatican. Koudelka summons Elaine's spirit, and they learn that Patrick used the \u00c9migr\u00e9 Document to resurrect Elaine; they resurrected her body as a monster, which caused the events at the mansion. Elaine\u2014who summoned Koudelka to aid her\u2014asks them to destroy her body so her spirit can be free. Bacon tells the group how to do this, in a section of Nemeton which has been converted into a temple.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc3\"/>\n\nThe three enter the temple and find Patrick's body. James destroys the temple, starting a fire which begins consuming the building.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc4\"/> Depending on the player's actions, three different endings are unlocked. If Koudelka does not regain her pendant, they are killed when they confront Elaine and the game is over. If she finds the pendant, Koudelka uses it to block Elaine's attack and they are cornered in the mansion's bell tower. If the party defeats Elaine, they contemplate the situation as the sun rises over the ruined mansion. If Elaine defeats them, James sacrifices himself to destroy Elaine, and Koudelka and Edward escape the collapsing tower. After spending the night together they part, although Koudelka believes that they will meet again.<ref name=\"KoudelkaBook\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDisc4\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Hiroki Kikuta @ MAGFest 9 (crop).jpg|thumb|alt=A bespectacled Hiroki Kikuta, in a plaid shirt and a stocking cap|Hiroki Kikuta (pictured in 2011) was heavily involved in the game's development, acting as producer, director, writer and composer.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/>]]\n''Koudelka'' was created by [[Hiroki Kikuta]], who composed ''[[Secret of Mana]]'', ''[[Seiken Densetsu 3]]'' and ''[[Soukaigi]]'' at [[Square (video game company)|Square]].<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> Kikuta wanted to direct his own game, but Square's corporate structure prevented him from moving beyond a composer.<ref name=\"StingInterview1\"/> Searching for a way to expand his role, Kikuta was introduced to the chairman of [[SNK]]; during their talk, he outlined many perceived pitfalls in the role-playing genre.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> Leaving Square, he formed [[Sacnoth]] in 1997 with other Square employees and SNK's funding.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/><ref name=\"SacnothBeginning\"/><ref name=\"SNKsacnoth\"/> As Sacnoth's CEO and the game's main creative lead, Kikuta wanted to create a [[Horror game|horror]] RPG. ''Koudelka'' began development after Sacnoth was founded, and Kikuta was its producer, director, writer and composer.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/><ref name=\"StingInterview1\"/>\n\nAlthough ''Koudelka'' used turn-based combat on a grid and random encounters (similar to traditional RPGs), this was not Kikuta's original intention. He originally planned a real-time battle system with free movement within the environment, combining mechanics from [[Simulation video game|simulation]] and [[adventure game]]s. Interactive environments, such as furniture, were also planned to play a part in combat.<ref name=\"StingInterview2\"/> Kikuta wanted to break away from RPG conventions, but other Sacnoth staff were reluctant to follow his example and retained traditional ideas from Square. Kikuta later regretted his lack of direct influence on the game design.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> About the battle-system design, art director Matsuzo Machida (credited as Matsuzo Itakura<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/><ref name=\"SHinterview\"/><ref name=\"ShadowDengeki\"/>) said that it was designed to be easy so adults who did not normally play games could see the game's ending; in hindsight, the team could have increased the challenge.<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/>\n\nThe game had English voice work for all characters, with Japan using native subtitles rather than a Japanese dub.<ref name=\"KoudelkaEnglish\"/> To create an authentic atmosphere, Kikuta used advanced [[motion capture]] technology to give realistic physical mannerisms to the character models during cutscenes.<ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/> Kikuta's decision to use motion capture, which he called \"epoch-making\", was part of his attempt to move away from RPG conventions by adding drama. The story required the capture of up to four people in each scene, impossible with technology available in Japan. Through the original staff of ''Soukaigi'', Kikuta contacted [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]-based special-effects company [[VisionArt|FutureLight]]. Intrigued by Kikuta's concept, FutureLight agreed to help record the cutscenes.<ref name=\"KoudelkaMocap\"/> In a later interview, he said that the techniques used for the motion-capture sessions were on a par with those used by [[Hollywood]] studios at the time.<ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/>\n\nThe game's cast provided motion capture and character voices. They were chosen from 100 actors who auditioned for the roles, including the twelve-year-old Sara Paxton as Charlotte.<ref name=\"KoudelkaMocap\"/> Vivianna Bateman, who played Koudelka, was chosen to give her character a cool, \"unique\" air. Kikuta called Edward's actor, Michael Bradberry, the \"mood maker\" for recording.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/> The motion-capture sessions took place in January 1998 at FutureLight's local studios. The motion capture and animation processes were handled by FutureLight and Sacnoth staff, with Kikuta the sessions' executive producer. Rehearsals, supervised by Kikuta, were held in a nearby hotel. The recording sessions were in a converted sound studio; since the studio was not fully soundproofed, recording was sometimes halted due to exterior noises. Equipment around the soundstage was used as props for the actors, so the in-game immersion would not be broken.<ref name=\"KoudelkaMocap\"/>\n\n===Scenario and art design===\nAccording to Kikuta, his research for the narrative and the basic elements of ''Koudelka'' took three months;<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/> the one-night timescale and singular location were due to the game's limited staff and development time.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog2\"/> Aberystwyth was chosen because he wanted a location across the sea from Ireland.<ref name=\"KoudelkaNemeton\"/> Due to a lack of Japanese resources on British architecture, Kikuta and several staff members made a research trip to [[Pembrokeshire]] to see local scenery and church architecture. The region's coastal cliffs, ancient ruins and weather conditions influenced ''Koudelka''{{'s}} setting and design.<ref name=\"StingInterview1\"/><ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaNemeton\"/> Kikuta's choice of 1898 was influenced by his wish for a story blending realism and fantasy; the end of the 19th century symbolised, to him, the intermingling of superstition and the next century's technological advances.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/> Kikuta wanted to explore the uneasy coexistence of magic and science in the game.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog2\"/> He bought over 100 books on British history during his research, from the medieval to the Victorian eras. His inspirations for the story included [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (and its [[The Name of the Rose (film)|film adaptation]]), [[William Hope Hodgson]]'s ''[[Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder]]'', [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'' and novels by [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]].<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> ''Koudelka''{{'s}} setting and story were primarily inspired by ''Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder''.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/> Kikuta incorporated a number of historical events and figures, including the sinking of the ''Princess Alice'' and fictionalized versions of Lord Dunsany and Roger Bacon. Charlotte's mother was based on [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]].<ref name=\"HavenInterview\"/> The story also included references to Celtic, Irish and Welsh mythology and folklore.<ref name=\"KoudelkaBook\"/>\n\nIts characters were designed by [[Y\u016bji Iwahara]], who created over 100 character sketches for the game.<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/> The visuals were inspired by the work of [[Bob Carlos Clarke]], [[Jan Saudek]] and Holly Warburton.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> Koudelka was among the first elements of the game created by Kikuta, with Iwahara's first character drafts created in March 1998. Koudelka's given name was taken from photographer [[Josef Koudelka]]; Kikuta liked its mysterious sound and lack of any specific ethnic origin. Kikuta's wish for a lonely character resulted in Koudelka's background as an exiled gypsy. Her design required several redrafts to be carried over into the game, which had severe polygon and memory restrictions.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/> Machida's design of Nemeton was intended to compress the variety of a typical RPG world map into a limited exploration space and permit detailed backgrounds within the console's hardware limitations. Nemeton used a blend of architectural styles, with elements ranging from its origins as a Gothic monastery (inspired by [[St Davids]]) to contemporary additions.<ref name=\"KoudelkaNemeton\"/> Koudelka's CGI model was created by Sacnoth and a company founded by artist Nobuji Watanabe, whom Kikuta chose for his passion for good work. The model went through multiple redrafts, with Kikuta making adjustments.<ref name=\"KoudelkaDesign\"/>\n\nIn creating ''Koudelka''{{'s}} storyline, Kikuta conceived a potential four-part series following her family through the 20th century with events and themes from the original clash of science and magic. In the first sequel, Koudelka would attend the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]; the second would move to [[Chicago]] in 1973 during the late [[Vietnam War]] and follow Koudelka's grandson, Rodmell, through an [[urban fantasy]] scenario. In the third, Rodmell would travel to [[Kyoto]] in 1984, where magic and modern life were still closely connected.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog1\"/><ref name=\"KikutaBlog2\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|Music of the Shadow Hearts series}}\nKikuta found composing the score the easiest part of development, since he primarily worked on his own. His concept for ''Koudelka''{{'s}} musical elements were created with the setting and narrative.<ref name=\"RocketInterview\"/> The score was arranged by Kikuta and [[Nick Ingman]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaLiners\"/> To compose the most of the game's tracks, Kikuta used [[Logic Pro|Atari Notator]] sound software. While he found lack of compression an issue, the better sequencing software was useful in creating the score for the CGI cutscenes.<ref name=\"KikutaBlog3\"/> With less music than the average RPG, the score was completed within six months.<ref name=\"GSinterview\"/> Instead of the looping tracks of Kikuta's work with Square, ''Koudelka'' used ambient sounds and short tracks related to cutscenes outside battle themes, and featured influences from [[church music]]. Its opening theme \"Requiem\" was performed by [[Catherine Bott]]. The ending theme \"Ubi Caritas et amor\"\u2014taken from a [[Quatre Motets sur des th\u00e8mes gr\u00e9goriens|larger composition]] by [[Maurice Durufl\u00e9]]\u2014was performed by the [[London Oratory School]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaLiners\"/>\n\nA CD soundtrack album was released in December 1999 by [[Pony Canyon]] and [[Scitron Digital Contents]], with over an hour of music and 34 tracks.<ref name=\"KikutaBlogAlbum\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaAudioB\"/> The album, which included all tracks from the game and live versions of three battle themes (arranged by Naoya Akimoto),<ref name=\"KoudelkaLiners\"/> received generally-positive reviews from music critics.<ref name=\"RPGFKoudelkaOST\"/><ref name=\"VGMOKoudelkaOST\"/> Its music was praised<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/><ref name=\"GSreview\"/> and criticized by reviewers of the game.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGFreview\"/><ref name=\"PowerReview\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Koudelka'' and its publisher, SNK, were first announced in September 1999.<ref name=\"KoudelkaAnnounced\"/> As part of its marketing campaign, a music CD and promotional poster were offered as pre-order bonuses.<ref name=\"KoudelkaInfo\"/> The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1999,<ref name=\"KoudelkaDates\"/> and was scheduled for a Western release by [[Electronic Arts]].<ref name=\"KoudeklaWest1\"/> It was later announced that [[Infogrames]] would publish the title in North America and Europe.<ref name=\"KoudelkaWest2\"/><ref name=\"KoudelkaSteam\"/> It was released overseas in 2000: on June 29 in North America,<ref name=\"KoudelkaDates\"/> and September 27 in Europe.<ref name=\"KoudelkaUKdate\"/> In addition to the PlayStation version, Sacnoth were reportedly developing a version for the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaNeo\"/> Console Classics announced plans in 2015 to port ''Koudelka'' to [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"KoudelkaSteam\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Media adaptations}}Adaptations===\nThe first of a three-volume manga adaptation, written and illustrated by Iwahara, was published in November 1999 by [[Kadokawa Shoten]];
