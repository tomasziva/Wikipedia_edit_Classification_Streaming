In animal anatomy, tentacles usually occur in one or more pairs. Anatomically, the tentacles of animals work mainly like [[muscular hydrostat]]s. Most forms of tentacles are used for grasping and feeding. Many are [[Sensory system|sensory organs]], variously receptive to [[somatosensory system|touch]], [[visual perception|vision]], or to the [[Chemoreceptor|smell or taste]] of particular foods or threats. Examples of such tentacles are the [[eyestalk]]s of various kinds of [[snail]]s. Some kinds of tentacles have both sensory and manipulatory functions.\n\nA tentacle is similar to a [[cirrus (biology)|cirrus]], but a cirrus is an organ that usually lacks the tentacle's strength, size, flexibility, or sensitivity.  A [[nautilus]] has cirri, but a [[squid]] has tentacles.\n\n==Invertebrates==\n\n===Molluscs===\n{{See also|Cephalopod limb}}\n[[Image:Snail-front-0A.jpg|thumb|right|Front view of land snail showing upper and lower sets of tentacles]]\n[[Image:White abalone Haliotis sorenseni.jpg|thumb|350 px|Abalone showing pallial tentacles]]\nMany molluscs have tentacles of one form or another. The most familiar are those of the [[Pulmonata|pulmonate land snails]], which usually have two sets of tentacles on the head: when extended the upper pair have eyes at their tips; the lower pair are [[chemoreceptor]]s. Both pairs are fully retractable [[muscular hydrostat]]s, but they are not used for manipulation or prey capture.\n\nSome marine snails such as [[abalone]] and top snails, [[Trochidae]], have numerous small tentacles around the edge of the [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]]. These are known as ''pallial tentacles''.<ref name=bou/>\n\nAmong [[cephalopod]]s, squid have spectacular tentacles. They take the form of highly mobile muscular hydrostats with various appendages such as suction disks and sometimes thorny hooks.

In [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] form, such as sea anemone and coral, the body is below with the tentacles pointed upwards.\n\nMany species of the jellyfish-like [[ctenophore]]s have two tentacles, while some have none. Their tentacles have adhesive structures called ''[[colloblast]]s'' or ''lasso cells''.
