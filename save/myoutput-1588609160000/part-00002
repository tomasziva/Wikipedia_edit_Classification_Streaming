Weeds of Australia, Queensland Biosecurity Edition</ref> It has been cultivated in Japan for about 1,000 years and presumably the fruits and seeds were brought back from China to Japan by the many Japanese scholars visiting and studying in China during the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThe loquat was often mentioned in medieval Chinese literature, such as the poems of [[Li Bai]]. Its original name is no longer used in most Chinese dialects, and has been replaced by ''pipa'' ({{lang|zh|\u6787\u6777}}), which is a reference to the fruit's visual resemblance to a miniature [[pipa]] lute.\n\nThe first European record of the species might have been in the 16th century by [[Micha\u0142 Boym]] Polish jesuit, orientalist, politician and missionary to China. He described loquat in his [[Flora sinensis]], the first European natural history book about China.<ref>Flora Chin.

Since the first contact of the Portuguese with the Japanese and Chinese dates also from the sixteenth century, it is possible that some were brought back to Europe, as was probably the case with other species like the ''hachiya'' persimmon variety.\n\n''Eriobotrya japonica'' was again described in Europe by [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], as ''Mespilus japonica'' in 1780, and was relocated to the genus ''Eriobotrya'' (from Greek ''\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf'' \"wool\" and ''\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd'' \"cluster\") by [[John Lindley]], who published these changes in 1821. \n\nThe most common variety in Portugal is the late ripening Tanaka, where it is popular in gardens and backyards, but not commercially produced. In northern Portugal it is also popularly called magn\u00f3rio/magn\u00f3lio, probably something to do with the French botanist Pierre Magnol. In Spain, the fruits are similarly called \"n\u00edsperos\" and are commercially explored, Spain being the largest producer worldwide, after China, with  41,487t annually, half of which is destined to export markets.\n\n==Cultivation==\nOver 800 loquat [[cultivar]]s exist in Asia. [[Self-fertile]] variants include the 'Gold Nugget' and 'Mogi' cultivars.<ref name=Staub/> The loquat is easy to grow in subtropical to mild temperate climates where it is often primarily grown as an [[ornamental plant]], especially for its sweet-scented flowers, and secondarily for its delicious fruit. The boldly textured foliage adds a tropical look to gardens, contrasting well with many other plants. It is popular in the [[Eastern United States]], as well as the [[Southern United States|American South]].\n\n[[Image:BlossomingLoquat.jpg|thumb|Loquat in flower.

Weeds of Australia, Queensland Biosecurity Edition</ref> It has been cultivated in Japan for about 1,000 years and presumably the fruits and seeds were brought back from China to Japan by the many Japanese scholars visiting and studying in China during the Tang Dynasty.\n\nThe loquat was often mentioned in medieval Chinese literature, such as the poems of [[Li Bai]]. Its original name is no longer used in most Chinese dialects, and has been replaced by ''pipa'' ({{lang|zh|\u6787\u6777}}), which is a reference to the fruit's visual resemblance to a miniature [[pipa]] lute.\n\nThe first European record of the species might have been in the 16th century by [[Micha\u0142 Boym]] Polish jesuit, orientalist, politician and missionary to China. He described loquat in his [[Flora sinensis]], the first European natural history book about China.<ref>Flora Chin.

Since the first contact of the Portuguese with the Japanese and Chinese dates also from the sixteenth century, it is possible that some were brought back to Europe, as was probably the case with other species like the ''hachiya'' persimmon variety.\n\n''Eriobotrya japonica'' was again described in Europe by [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], as ''Mespilus japonica'' in 1780, and was relocated to the genus ''Eriobotrya'' (from Greek ''\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf'' \"wool\" and ''\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd'' \"cluster\") by [[John Lindley]], who published these changes in 1821. \n\nThe most common variety in Portugal is the late ripening Tanaka, where it is popular in gardens and backyards, but not commercially produced. In northern Portugal it is also popularly called magn\u00f3rio/magn\u00f3lio, probably something to do with the French botanist Pierre Magnol. In Spain, the fruits are similarly called \"n\u00edsperos\" and are commercially explored, Spain being the largest producer worldwide, after China, with  41,487t annually, half of which is destined to export markets.\n\n==Cultivation==\nOver 800 loquat [[cultivar]]s exist in Asia. [[Self-fertile]] variants include the 'Gold Nugget' and 'Mogi' cultivars.<ref name=Staub/> The loquat is easy to grow in subtropical to mild temperate climates where it is often primarily grown as an [[ornamental plant]], especially for its sweet-scented flowers, and secondarily for its delicious fruit. The boldly textured foliage adds a tropical look to gardens, contrasting well with many other plants. It is popular in the [[Eastern United States]], as well as the [[Southern United States|American South]].\n\n[[Image:BlossomingLoquat.jpg|thumb|Loquat in flower.
