The name ''Venetia'', however, derives from the Roman name for the people known as the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]], and called by the Greeks ''Enetoi'' (\u1f18\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af). The meaning of the word is uncertain, although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names, such as the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Celtic Veneti]] and the [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Vistula Veneti]]. Linguists suggest that the name is based on an [[protoindoeuropean|Indo-European]] root *''wen'' (\"love\"), so that *''wenetoi'' would mean \"beloved\", \"lovable\", or \"friendly\". A connection with the Latin word ''venetus'', meaning the color 'sea-blue', is also possible.\nSupposed connections of ''Venetia'' with the Latin verb ''venire'' (to come), such as [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marin Sanudo]]'s ''veni etiam'' (\"Yet, I have come!\"), the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland, or even with ''venia'' (\"forgiveness\") [[folk etymology|are fanciful]].

This part of Roman Italy was again overrun in the early 5th century by the [[Visigoths]] and, some 50&nbsp;years later, by the Huns led by [[Attila]]. The last and most enduring immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula, that of the [[Lombards]] in 568, left the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] only a small strip of coastline in the current Veneto, including Venice. The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], administered from that ancient port and overseen by a viceroy (the [[Exarch]]) appointed by the Emperor in [[Constantinople]]. Ravenna and Venice were connected only by sea routes, and with the Venetians' isolation came increasing autonomy. New ports were built, including those at [[Malamocco]] and [[Torcello]] in the Venetian lagoon. The ''tribuni maiores'' formed the earliest central standing governing committee of the islands in the lagoon, dating from c.&nbsp;568.<ref>Traditional date as given in William J. Langer, ed.

Some modern historians claim Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually the [[Paul (exarch)|Exarch Paul]], and Paul's successor, [[Marcello Tegalliano]], was Paul's ''[[magister militum]]'' (or \"general\"), literally \"master of soldiers\". In 726 the soldiers and citizens of the exarchate rose in a rebellion over the [[iconoclastic controversy]], at the urging of [[Pope Gregory II]]. The exarch, held responsible for the acts of his master, Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], was murdered, and many officials were put to flight in the chaos. At about this time, the people of the lagoon elected their own independent leader for the first time, although the relationship of this to the uprisings is not clear. [[Orso Ipato|Ursus]] was the first of 117 \"[[Doge of Venice|doges]]\" (''doge'' is the [[Venetian language|Venetian dialectal]] equivalent of the Latin ''[[dux]]'' (\"leader\"); the corresponding word in English is [[duke]], in standard Italian ''duca''.  (See also \"[[duce]]\".) Whatever his original views, Ursus supported Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]]'s successful military expedition to recover Ravenna, sending both men and ships. In recognition of this, Venice was \"granted numerous privileges and concessions\" and Ursus, who had personally taken the field, was confirmed by Leo as ''[[dux]]''.<ref>[[John Julius Norwich]].

New York: Barnes & Noble (reprint orig. 1898 London).</ref>\n\nIn 751, the Lombard King [[Aistulf]] conquered most of the Exarchate of Ravenna, leaving Venice a lonely and increasingly autonomous Byzantine outpost. During this period, the seat of the local Byzantine governor (the \"duke/dux\", later \"doge\"), was at [[Malamocco]]. Settlement on the islands in the lagoon probably increased with the Lombard conquest of other Byzantine territories, as refugees sought asylum in the area. In 775/6, the [[bishop|episcopal]] seat of Olivolo ([[San Pietro di Castello]], namely Helipolis{{citation needed |date=August 2015}}) was created. During the reign of duke [[Agnello Particiaco]] (811\u2013827) the ducal seat moved from Malamocco to the more protected Rialto, within present-day Venice. The monastery of St.&nbsp;Zachary and the first [[Doge's Palace, Venice|ducal palace]] and [[basilica of St. Mark]], as well as a walled defense (''civitatis murus'') between Olivolo and Rialto, were subsequently built here.\n\n[[Charlemagne]] sought to subdue the city to his rule. He ordered the pope to expel the Venetians from the [[Pentapolis]] along the Adriatic coast;<ref>Langer</ref> Charlemagne's own son [[Pepin of Italy]], [[king of the Lombards]], under the authority of his father, embarked on a siege of Venice itself. This, however, proved a costly failure. The siege lasted six months, with Pepin's army ravaged by the diseases of the local swamps and eventually forced to withdraw in 810. A few months later, Pepin himself died, apparently as a result of a disease contracted there. In the aftermath, an agreement between [[Charlemagne]] and the Byzantine Emperor [[Nikephoros I Logothetes|Nicephorus]] in 814 recognized Venice as Byzantine territory, and granted the city trading rights along the Adriatic coast.\n\nIn 828 the new city's prestige increased with the acquisition, from [[Alexandria]], of relics claimed to be of [[St Mark the Evangelist]]; these were placed in the new basilica. Winged lions\u2014visible throughout Venice\u2014are the [[Four Evangelists#Symbols|emblem of St Mark]].  The patriarchal seat was also moved to Rialto. As the community continued to develop, and as Byzantine power waned, its own autonomy grew, leading to eventual independence.<ref>Thomas F. Madden. (2013). ''Venice: A New History''.

The doge already possessed the titles of Duke of [[Dalmatia]] and Duke of [[Istria]]. Later mainland possessions, which extended across [[Lake Garda]] as far west as the [[Adda River]], were known as the ''Terraferma''; they were acquired partly as a buffer against belligerent neighbours, partly to guarantee [[Alps|Alpine]] trade routes, and partly to ensure the supply of mainland wheat (on which the city depended).

In the first chrysobull, Venice acknowledged its homage to the empire; but not in the second, reflecting the decline of [[Byzantium]] and the rise of Venice's power.<ref>Herrin, Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire, Penguin, Harmondsworth, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103102-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=fqa |title=History of Venice |publisher=Historyworld.net |accessdate=28 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nVenice became an imperial power following the [[Fourth Crusade]], which, having veered off course, culminated in 1204 by capturing and sacking [[Constantinople]] and establishing the [[Latin Empire]]. As a result of this conquest, considerable Byzantine plunder was brought back to Venice. This plunder included the [[Horses of Saint Mark|gilt bronze horses]] from the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], which were originally placed above the entrance to the cathedral of Venice, [[St Mark's Basilica]] (The originals have been replaced with replicas, and are now stored within the basilica.)  After the fall of Constantinople, the former Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned among the Latin crusaders and the Venetians. Venice subsequently carved out a sphere of influence in the Mediterranean known as the [[Duchy of the Archipelago]], and captured Crete.<ref>Thomas F.

Venice's leading families vied with each other to build the grandest palaces and to support the work of the greatest and most talented artists. The city was governed by the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]], which was made up of members of the noble families of Venice. The Great Council appointed all public officials, and elected a Senate of 200 to 300 individuals. Since this group was too large for efficient administration, a [[Council of Ten]] (also called the Ducal Council, or the Signoria), controlled much of the administration of the city. One member of the great council was elected \"[[doges of Venice|doge]]\", or duke, to be the chief executive; he would usually hold the title until his death, although several Doges were forced, by pressure from their [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] peers, to resign and retire into [[monastery|monastic]] seclusion, when they were felt to have been discredited by political failure.\n\nThe Venetian governmental structure was similar in some ways to the republican system of ancient Rome, with <!-- \n1 -->an elected chief executive (the doge), <!-- \n2 -->a senator-like assembly of nobles, and <!-- \n3 -->the general citizenry with limited political power, who originally had the power to grant or withhold their approval of each newly elected doge. \nChurch and various private properties were tied to military service, although there was no knight tenure within the city itself. \nThe ''Cavalieri di San Marco'' was the only order of [[chivalry]] ever instituted in Venice, and no citizen could accept or join a foreign order without the government's consent. \nVenice remained a republic throughout its independent period, \nand politics and the military were kept separate, \nexcept when on occasion the Doge personally headed the military. \nWar was regarded as a continuation of commerce by other means \n(whence, \nthe city's early employment of large numbers of mercenaries for service elsewhere, and \nlater its reliance on foreign mercenaries when the ruling class was preoccupied with commerce\n).\n\n[[File:Gaspar van Wittel - View of the San Marco Basin.JPG|thumb|View of [[San Marco basin]] in 1697]]\n[[File:Canaletto Grand Canal from Palazzo Flangini - JPGM.jpg|thumb|''[[The Grand Canal in Venice from Palazzo Flangini to Campo San Marcuola]]'', [[Canaletto]], circa 1738, [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]]]\n\nAlthough the people of Venice generally remained orthodox Roman Catholics, \nthe state of Venice was notable for its freedom from religious fanaticism, \nand executed nobody for religious heresy during the [[Counter-Reformation]]. \nThis apparent lack of zeal contributed to Venice's frequent conflicts with the [[papacy]]. \nIn this context, the writings of the Anglican divine [[William Bedell]] are particularly illuminating. \nVenice was threatened with the [[interdict]] on a number of occasions \nand twice suffered its imposition. \nThe second, most noted, occasion was in 1606, by order of [[Pope Paul V]].\n\nThe newly invented German [[printing press]] spread rapidly throughout Europe in the 15th century, and Venice was quick to adopt it. \nBy 1482, Venice was the printing capital of the world; \nthe leading printer was [[Aldus Manutius]], who invented paperback books that could be carried in a saddlebag.\n\nHis ''Aldine Editions'' included translations of nearly all the known Greek manuscripts of the \nera.<ref>James Burke, ''Connections'' (Little, Brown and Co., 1978/1995, {{ISBN|978-0-316-11672-5}}, p.105</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\n[[File:The Grand Canal, Venice c1760 Francesco Guardi.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Guardi]], ''The Grand Canal'', circa 1760 ([[Art Institute of Chicago]])]]\n\nVenice's long decline started in the 15th century, when it first made an unsuccessful [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422\u20131430)|attempt to hold Thessalonica]] against the Ottomans (1423\u20131430). It also sent ships to help defend Constantinople against the besieging Turks (1453). After [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell]] to [[Sultan Mehmed II]], he declared the first of a series of [[Ottoman-Venetian wars]] that cost Venice much of its eastern Mediterranean possessions. Even more decisive than the [[Columbian exchange]] and the beginning of Atlantic trade following Christopher Columbus's voyage of 1492 was [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first voyage of 1497\u201399, which opened a sea route to India around the Cape of Good Hope and destroyed Venice's monopoly. France, England, and the Dutch Republic quickly followed Spain and Portugal, but Venice's oared galleys were at a disadvantage when it came to traversing the great oceans, and therefore Venice was left behind in the race for colonies.\n\nThe [[Black Death]] devastated Venice in 1348, and once again between 1575 and 1577.<ref>William J.

However, the Venetian empire remained a major exporter of agricultural products, and until the mid-18th century, a significant [[manufacturing]] center.\n\n=== Modern age ===\n{{Wide image|Panorama of Venice 1870s.jpg|3000px|align-cap=center|1870s panoramic view of Venice}}\n\nDuring the 18th century, Venice became perhaps the most elegant and refined city in Europe, greatly influencing art, architecture, and literature. But the Republic lost its independence when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] conquered Venice on 12 May 1797 during the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Napoleon was seen as something of a liberator by the city's Jewish population. He removed the gates of the [[Venetian Ghetto|Ghetto]] and ended the restrictions on when and where Jews could live and travel in the city.\n\nVenice became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] on 12 October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. Venice was taken from Austria by the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]. In 1848 a revolt briefly re-established the [[Repubblica di San Marco|Venetian republic]] under [[Daniele Manin]], but this was crushed in 1849. In 1866, after the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], Venice, along with the rest of the Veneto, became part of the newly created [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].\n\n[[File:Morning Impression along a Canal in Venice.JPG|thumb|''Morning Impression along a Canal in Venice, Veneto, Italy'' by [[Rafail Levitsky]] (1896)]]\n[[Image:View from the Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri), Venice Italy.jpg|thumb|View from the Bridge of Sighs]]\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the historic city was largely free from attack, the only aggressive effort of note being [[Operation Bowler]], a successful [[Royal Air Force]] precision strike on the German naval operations in the city in March 1945.

At first, this was to be a temporary tax, but it remained in effect until the fall of the Republic in 1797. Shortly after the introduction of the tax, Spain produced similar paper for general taxation purposes, and the practice spread to other countries.\n\nDuring the 20th century, when many [[artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] were sunk into the periphery of the lagoon to draw water for local industry, Venice began to [[subsidence|subside]]. It was realized that extraction of water from the [[aquifer]] was the cause. The sinking has slowed markedly since artesian wells were banned in the 1960s. However, the city is still threatened by more frequent low-level floods\u2014the ''[[Acqua alta]]'', that rise to a height of several centimetres over its quays\u2014regularly following certain tides.

These parishes predate the ''sestieri'', which were created in about 1170. Each parish exhibited unique characteristics but also belonged to an integrated network. Each community chose its own patron saint, staged its own festivals, congregated around its own market center, constructed its own bell towers, and developed its own customs.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Venice: History Of The Floating City |last=Ferraro |first=Joanne |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |isbn= |location=New York |pages= |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nOther islands of the [[Venetian Lagoon]] do not form part of any of the ''sestieri'', having historically enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy.\n\nEach ''sestiere'' has its own [[house numbering]] system. Each house has a unique number in the district, from one to several thousand, generally numbered from one corner of the area to another, but not usually in a readily understandable manner.\n\n=== Municipality ===\n<gallery>\nFile:MunicipalitaVCE.png|The 6 boroughs of the whole ''comune'' of Venice\nFile:Map of comune of Venice (province of Venice, region Veneto, Italy).svg|The whole ''comune'' (red) in the [[Metropolitan City of Venice]]\nFile:Ca'Loredan Venice.jpg|''Ca' Loredan'', Venice's City Hall\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Venice City Council 2015.svg|thumb|right|250px|Venice City Council composition <br />(2015\u20132020)]]\nThe legislative body of the Comune is the Consiglio Comunale (\"city council\"), which is composed of 45 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually{{clarify|date=August 2015}} to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed of 12 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]] nominated and presided over by a directly elected [[Mayor]].\n\nVenice was governed by center-left parties from the 1990s until the 2010s, when the mayor started to be elected directly. Its region [[Veneto]] has long been a conservative stronghold, with the coalition between the regionalist [[Lega Nord]] and the center-right [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] winning absolute majorities of the electorate in many elections at communal, national, and regional levels.\n\nIn June 2015, after a corruption scandal that forced the center-left mayor [[Giorgio Orsoni]] to resign, Venice voted for the first time for a conservative directly-elected mayor: the center-right businessman [[Luigi Brugnaro]] won the election in the second round of voting, with 53% of the votes against the leftist magistrate, and member of the [[Italian Senate]], [[Felice Casson]], who led in the first round with 38% of the votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/venice-mayoral-poll-cruise-ships-luigi-brugnaro|title=Venice mayoral election result may open way for bigger cruise ships|first=Stephanie|last=Kirchgaessner|date=15 June 2015|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:La villa Bianca (Lido de Venise) (8150126764).jpg|thumb|right|Villa Bianca in the residential district of [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]]]]\n\nThe municipality of Venice is subdivided into six administrative boroughs (''municipalit\u00e0'').

Although there is little specific information about the earliest years, it is likely that an important source of the city's prosperity was the trade in slaves, captured in central Europe and sold to North Africa and the Levant. Venice's location at the head of the Adriatic, and directly south of the terminus of the [[Brenner Pass]] over the Alps, would have given it a distinct advantage as a middleman in this important trade. In the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Venice was a major center for commerce and trade, as it controlled a vast sea-empire, and became an extremely wealthy European city and a leader in political and economic affairs,.<ref name=\"aboutvenice.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutvenice.org/economy-of-venice.html |title=The economy of Venice, Italy |publisher=Aboutvenice.org | accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> From the 11th century until the 15th century, [[pilgrimage]]s to the [[Holy Land]] were offered in Venice.

The adjoining [[Ponte della Libert\u00e0]] road causeway and terminal parking facilities in Tronchetto island and Piazzale Roma were built during the 20th century. Beyond these rail and road terminals on the northern edge of the city, transportation within the city's historic centre remains, as it was in centuries past, entirely on water or on foot. Venice is Europe's largest urban [[Auto-free zones|car-free area]] and is unique in Europe in having remained a sizable functioning city in the 21st century entirely without motorcars or trucks.\n\nThe classic Venetian boat is the ''[[gondola]]'', (plural: ''gondole'') although it is now mostly used for tourists, or for weddings, funerals, or other ceremonies, or as ''traghetti'' (sing.: traghetto) to cross the Grand Canal in lieu of a nearby bridge. The traghetti are operated by two oarsmen. For some years there were seven such boats; but by 2017, only three remained.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/veneto/venice/articles/venice-attractions/|title=Venice attractions|first=Anne|last=Hanley|date=10 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThere are approximately 400 licensed gondoliers in Venice, in their distinctive livery, and a similar number of boats, down from 10,000 two centuries ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/11/the-right-stripes-how-fashion-fell-for-the-gondolier|title=The right stripes: how fashion fell for the gondolier|first=Morwenna|last=Ferrier|date=11 August 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref name=\"ricksteves.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/the-gondolas-of-venice|title=The Gondolas of Venice \u2013 Rick Steves' Europe|website=www.ricksteves.com}}</ref> Many gondolas are lushly appointed with crushed velvet seats and Persian rugs. At the front of each gondola that works in the city, there is a large piece of metal called the ''f\u00e8ro'' (iron). Its shape has evolved through the centuries, as documented in many well-known paintings. Its form, topped by a likeness of the Doge's hat, became gradually standardized, and was then fixed by local law. It consists of six bars pointing forward representing the sestieri of the city, and one that points backwards representing the [[Giudecca]].<ref name=\"ricksteves.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelsantelena.com/blog/visit-venice-through-gondolas-symbolism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 June 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609022508/http://www.hotelsantelena.com/blog/visit-venice-through-gondolas-symbolism/ |archivedate=9 June 2017  }}</ref> A lesser-known boat is the smaller, simpler, but similar, [[sandolo]].\n\n==== Waterways ====\n[[File:Rialto Gondoliers.jpg|thumb|[[Rialto Bridge]]]]\n\nVenice's small islands were enhanced during the Middle Ages by the dredging of soil to raise the marshy ground above the tides. The resulting canals encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city. Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city.\n\nThe maze of canals threading through the city requires more than 400 bridges to permit the flow of foot traffic. In 2011, the city opened the [[Ponte della Costituzione]], the fourth bridge across the Grand Canal, which connects the [[Piazzale Roma]] bus-terminal area with the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station. The other bridges are the original [[Ponte di Rialto]], the [[Ponte dell'Accademia]], and the [[Ponte degli Scalzi]].\n\n=== Public transport ===\n[[Azienda del Consorzio Trasporti Veneziano]] (ACTV) is a public company responsible for public transportation in Venice.\n\n==== Lagoon area ====\n[[File:Vaporetti Venice Lagoon.jpg|thumb|Vaporetti on the Grand Canal]]\n\nThe main means of public transportation consists of motorised [[waterbus]]es (''[[vaporetto|vaporetti]]'') which ply regular routes along the Grand Canal and between the city's islands. Private motorised water taxis are also active. The only gondole still in common use by Venetians are the ''traghetti'', foot passenger [[ferry|ferries]] crossing the Grand Canal at certain points where there are no convenient bridges. Other gondole are rented by tourists on an hourly basis.<ref name=\"ricksteves.com\"/>\n\nThe [[Venice People Mover]] is an elevated shuttle train [[public transit]] system connecting [[Tronchetto island]] with its car parking facility with Piazzale Roma where visitors arrive in the city by bus, taxi, or automobile. The train makes a stop at the Marittima cruise terminal at the [[Port of Venice]].<ref>https://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/venice-people-mover.htm, Venice People Mover (2019)</ref>\n\n==== Lido and Pellestrina islands ====\n[[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Pellestrina]] are two islands forming a barrier between the southern Venetian Lagoon and the Adriatic Sea. On those islands, road traffic, including bus service, is allowed. Vaporetti link them with other islands (Venice, [[Murano]], [[Burano]]) and with the peninsula of [[Cavallino-Treporti]].\n\n==== Mainland ====\nThe mainland of Venice is composed of 5 boroughs: [[Mestre]]-Carpenedo, [[Marghera]], Chirignago-Zelarino, and Favaro Veneto. Mestre is the center and the most populous urban area of the mainland. There are several bus routes and two [[Translohr]] [[Trams in Mestre|tramway lines]]. Several bus routes and one of the tramway lines link the mainland with ''[[Piazzale Roma]]'', the main bus station in Venice, via [[Ponte della Libert\u00e0]], the road bridge connecting the mainland with the group of islands that comprise the historic center of Venice.\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Venice, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 52 min. Only 12.2% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 10 min, while 17.6% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km}}, while 12% travel for over {{convert|12|km}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Italy_Venezia-2083|title=Venezia Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=19 June 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Chiesa di Sant'Andrea Apostolo ou della Zirada - People Mover of Venice.jpg|People Mover in Venice\nFile:Waterbus routes in Venezia map.jpg|A map of the waterbus routes in Venezia\nFile:IRISBUS ACTV.JPG|Bus in Mestre\nFile:Actv tram Venezia leaving Piazzale Roma 2017.jpg|[[Trams in Mestre|Tram in Venice]] leaving [[Piazzale Roma]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Trains ===\n[[File:Venezia Santa Lucia Train Station R02.jpg|thumb|The [[Venezia Santa Lucia railway station|Venice Santa Lucia station]]]]\n\nVenice is serviced by regional and national trains, including trains to Florence (1h53), Milan (2h13), Turin (3h10), Rome (3h33), and Naples (4h50). In addition there are international day trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, Munich, and Vienna, plus overnight sleeper services, to Paris and Dijon on [[Thello]] trains, and to Munich and Vienna via [[Austrian Federal Railways|\u00d6BB]].\n* The [[Venezia Santa Lucia railway station|St Lucia station]] is a few steps away from a vaporetti stop in the historic city next to the ''Piazzale Roma''. As well as for other, local trains, this station is the terminus of the luxury [[Venice Simplon Orient Express]] from London via Paris and other cities.\n* The [[Venezia Mestre railway station|Mestre station]] is on the mainland, on the border between the boroughs of Mestre and Marghera.\n\nBoth stations are managed by [[Grandi Stazioni]]; they are linked by the ''Ponte della Libert\u00e0'' (Liberty Bridge) between the mainland and the city center.\n\nOther stations in the municipality are Venezia Porto Marghera, Venezia Carpenedo, Venezia Mestre Ospedale, and Venezia Mestre Porta Ovest.\n\n=== Ports ===\n[[File:2017 06 Venezia Terminal Passeggeri Terminal Passeggeri 2860.jpg|thumb|[[Cruise ship]]s at the passenger terminal in the [[Port of Venice]] (''Venezia Terminal Passeggeri'')]]\n[[File:Aeroporto di Venezia - vue aerienne.jpg|thumb|[[Marco Polo International Airport]] (''Aeroporto di Venezia [[Marco Polo]]'')]]\n\nThe [[Port of Venice]] ({{lang-it|Porto di Venezia}}) is the eighth-busiest commercial port in Italy and is a major hub for the cruise sector in the [[Mediterranean]].

Polo (1254\u20131324) was a merchant who voyaged to [[the Orient]]. His series of books, co-written with [[Rustichello da Pisa]] and titled ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]'' provided important knowledge of the lands east of Europe, from the Middle East to China, Japan, and Russia. [[Giacomo Casanova]] (1725\u20131798) was a prolific writer and adventurer best remembered for his autobiography, ''Histoire De Ma Vie'' (''Story of My Life''), which links his colourful lifestyle to the city of Venice.\n\n[[File:Venice city scenes - on the Grand Canal - Polizia! (11002248065).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Santa Maria della Salute]]]]\n\nVenetian playwrights followed the old Italian theatre tradition of ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''. [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzante]] (1502\u20131542), [[Carlo Goldoni]] (1707\u20131793), and [[Carlo Gozzi]] (1720\u20131806) used the Venetian dialect extensively in their comedies.\n\nVenice has also inspired writers from abroad. Shakespeare set ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' in the city, as did [[Thomas Mann]] his novel, ''[[Death in Venice]]'' (1912). The French writer [[Philippe Sollers]] spent most of his life in Venice and published '' A Dictionary For Lovers of Venice'' in 2004.\n\nThe city features prominently in [[Henry James]]'s ''[[The Aspern Papers]]'' and ''[[The Wings of the Dove]]''. It is also visited in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' and [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. Perhaps the best-known children's book set in Venice is ''The Thief Lord'', written by the German author [[Cornelia Funke]].\n\nThe poet [[Ugo Foscolo]] (1778\u20131827), born in [[Zakynthos|Zante]], an island that at the time belonged to the Republic of Venice, was also a [[revolutionary]] who wanted to see a free republic established in Venice following its fall to [[Napoleon]].\n\nVenice also inspired the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]], who wrote his first literary work in the city. Pound died in 1972, and his remains are buried in Venice's [[:commons:Category:Cimitero di San Michele (Venice)|cemetery island]] of [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele]].\n\nVenice is also linked to the technological aspects of writing. The city was the location of one of Italy's earliest printing presses called [[Aldine Press]], established by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1494.<ref name=\"Aldus and His Dream Book\">{{cite book|last1=Barolini|first1=Helen|title=Aldus and His Dream Book|date=1992|publisher=Italica Press, Inc.|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-934977-22-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.triposo.com/loc/Venice/culture/background|title=Venice Culture|website=www.triposo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> From this beginning Venice developed as an important typographic center.

Examples of these include:\n* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'' ({{circa|1596\u20131598}}) and ''[[Othello]]'' (1603).\n* [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605\u20136).\n* [[Casanova]]'s autobiographical [[Histoire de ma vie|''History of My Life'']] {{circa|1789\u20131797}}.\n* [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' (1759).\n* [[Italo Calvino]]'s [[Invisible Cities]] (1972).\n* [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Cry to Heaven]]'' (1982).\n* [[Donna Leon]]'s Commissario Guido Brunetti [[crime fiction]] series and cookbook, and the German television series based on the novels (1992\u20132019).\n* [[Philippe Sollers]]' ''[[Watteau in Venice]]'' (1994).\n* [[Michael Dibdin]]'s ''[[Dead Lagoon]]'' (1994), one in a series of novels featuring Venice-born policeman Aurelio Zen.\n* [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s ''[[Kushiel's Chosen]]'' (2002), an [[historical fantasy]] or [[alternate history]] of Venice\u2014complete with masquerades, canals, and a doge\u2014taking place in a city known as La Serenissima.\n\nAdditionally, [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'' (1912), was the basis for Benjamin Britten's [[Death in Venice (opera)|eponymous opera]] (1973).\n\n==== Foreign words of Venetian origin ====\nSome words with a Venetian etymology include [[:wikt:arsenal|arsenal]], [[:wikt:ciao|ciao]], [[:wikt:ghetto|ghetto]], [[:wikt:gondola|gondola]], [[:wikt:imbroglio|imbroglio]], [[:wikt:lagoon|lagoon]], [[:wikt:lazaret|lazaret]], [[:wikt:lido|lido]], [[:wikt:Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[:wikt:regatta|regatta]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign words of Venetian origination|author=Hannah Fielding|date=9 November 2013|website=hannahfielding.net|url=http://hannahfielding.net/foreign-words-of-venetian-origin/}}</ref>\n\n=== Printing ===\nBy the end of the 15th century, Venice had become the European capital of printing, having 417 printers by 1500, and being one of the first cities in Italy (after Subiaco and Rome) to have a printing press, after those established in Germany. The most important printing office was the [[Aldine Press]] of [[Aldus Manutius]]; which in 1497 issued the first printed work of [[Aristotle]]; in 1499 printed the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', considered the most beautiful book of the [[Renaissance]]; and established modern [[punctuation]], page format, and [[italic type]].\n\n=== Painting ===\n{{Main|List of painters and architects of Venice}}\n{{See also|Venetian School (art)}}\n[[File:Canaletto - Bucentaur's return to the pier by the Palazzo Ducale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century view of Venice by Venetian artist [[Canaletto]].]]\n\nVenice, especially during the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], and [[Baroque]] periods, was a major centre of art and developed a unique style known as the [[Venetian School (art)|Venetian School]]. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Venice, along with [[Florence]] and Rome, became one of the most important centres of art in Europe, and numerous wealthy Venetians became patrons of the arts.

It is signified by a warm colour scale and a picturesque use of colour. Early masters were the Bellini and Vivarini families, followed by [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian]], then [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. In the early 16th century, there was rivalry in Venetian painting between the ''disegno'' and ''colorito'' techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/feast/context/venetianart.html |title=Venetian art around 1500 |publisher=Webexhibits.org |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Canvas]]es (the common painting surface) originated in Venice during the early Renaissance. These early canvases were generally rough.\n\nIn the 18th century, Venetian painting had a revival with [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]'s decorative painting and [[Canaletto]]'s and [[Guardi]]'s panoramic views.\n\n=== Venetian architecture ===\n{{main|Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian Renaissance architecture}}\n[[File:Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti WB.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti]] is an example of Venetian Gothic architecture alongside the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].]]\n[[File:Ca' d'Oro facciata.jpg|thumb|The [[Ca' d'Oro]].]]\n\nVenice is built on unstable mud-banks, and had a very crowded city centre by the Middle Ages. On the other hand, the city was largely safe from riot, civil feuds, and invasion much earlier than most European cities. These factors, with the canals and the great wealth of the city, made for unique building styles.\n  \nVenice has a rich and diverse [[architectural style]], the most prominent of which is the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. [[Venetian Gothic architecture]] is a term given to a Venetian building style combining the use of the Gothic [[lancet window|lancet arch]] with the curved [[ogee arch]], due to [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] influences. The style originated in 14th-century Venice, with a confluence of [[Byzantine]] style from [[Constantinople]], Islamic influences from [[Islamic Spain|Spain]] and Venice's eastern trading partners, and early Gothic forms from mainland Italy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Chief examples of the style are the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] and the [[Ca' d'Oro]] in the city. The city also has several [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] buildings, including the [[Ca' Pesaro]] and the [[Ca' Rezzonico]].\n\nVenetian taste was conservative and [[Renaissance architecture]] only really became popular in buildings from about the 1470s.  More than in the rest of Italy, it kept much of the typical form of the Gothic ''palazzi'', which had evolved to suit Venetian conditions. In turn the transition to [[Baroque architecture]] was also fairly gentle. This gives the crowded buildings on the Grand Canal and elsewhere an essential harmony, even where buildings from very different periods sit together. For example, round-topped arches are far more common in Renaissance buildings than elsewhere.\n  \n[[File:Hotel Danieli-dandolo 2012.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Dandolo]].]]\n[[File:Ca' Rezzonico (Venice).jpg|thumb|The [[Baroque]] [[Ca' Rezzonico]].]]\n\n=== Rococo style ===\nIt can be argued that Venice produced the best and most refined [[Rococo]] designs. At the time, the Venitian economy was in decline.  It had lost most of its maritime power, was lagging behind its rivals in political importance, and its society had become decadent, with tourism increasingly the mainstay of the economy. But Venice remained a centre of fashion.<ref name=\"Miller 2005 p.82\">Miller (2005) p.82</ref> Venetian rococo was well known as rich and luxurious, with usually very extravagant designs. Unique Venetian furniture types included the ''divani da portego'', and long rococo couches and ''pozzetti'', objects meant to be placed against the wall. Bedrooms of rich Venetians were usually sumptuous and grand, with rich damask, velvet, and silk drapery and curtains, and beautifully carved rococo beds with statues of [[putti]], flowers, and angels.<ref name=\"Miller 2005 p.82\" /> Venice was especially known for its beautiful [[Girandole|girandole mirrors]], which remained among, if not the, finest in Europe. Chandeliers were usually very colourful, using [[Murano glass]] to make them look more vibrant and stand out from others; and precious stones and materials from abroad were used, since Venice still held a vast trade empire. Lacquer was very common, and many items of furniture were covered with it, the most noted being ''lacca povera'' (poor lacquer), in which allegories and images of social life were painted. Lacquerwork and [[Chinoiserie]] were particularly common in bureau cabinets.<ref>Miller (2005) p.83</ref>\n\n=== Glass ===\n{{Main|Venetian glass}}\n\nVenice is known for its ornate glass-work, known as [[Venetian glass]], which is world-renowned for being colourful, elaborate, and skilfully made.\n\n[[File:Lampadario in vetro di Murano - Ca' Rezzonico, Venice.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Murano glass]] [[chandelier]] [[Ca'&nbsp;Rezzonico]] ]]\n\nMany of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the 13th century. Toward the end of that century, the center of the Venetian glass industry moved to [[Murano]], an offshore island in Venice. The glass made there is known as [[Murano glass]].\n\n[[File:Venetian glass goblet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Venetian glass]] [[goblet]] ]]\n\nByzantine craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass. When [[Constantinople]] was sacked in the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice. This happened again when the [[Ottomans]] took Constantinople in 1453, supplying Venice with still more glassworkers. By the 16th century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the color and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques.\n\nDespite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.\n\nSome of the most important brands of glass in the world today are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. They are: Venini, Barovier & Toso, [[Pauly & C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]], Millevetri, and Seguso.<ref>Carl I. Gable,\n''Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists'' (Schiffer, 2004). {{ISBN|978-0-7643-1946-4}}.</ref> Barovier & Toso is considered one of the 100 [[List of oldest companies|oldest companies]] in the world, formed in 1295.\n\n=== Festivals ===\n{{See also|Carnival of Venice|Venice Film Festival}}\n{{multiple image | align = right | total_width = 420 | direction = horizontal\n| width1 =300 | image1 = Carnevale di Venezia Masks 2010.jpg | alt1 =\n| width2 = 300 | image2 = VeniceShopWindow.jpg| alt2 = Map\n| footer = Typical [[Venetian mask|masks]] worn during the [[Carnival of Venice]].}}\n\nThe [[Carnival of Venice]] is held annually in the city, It lasts for around two weeks and ends on [[Shrove Tuesday]].

The Venetian state \u2013 i.e., the medieval [[Republic of Venice]] \u2013 was often popularly called the \"Republic of Music\", and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that \"In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere.\"<ref>Touring Club p. 79</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century, Venice became one of the most important musical centers of Europe, marked by a characteristic style of composition (the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]]) and the development of the [[Venetian polychoral style]] under composers such as [[Adrian Willaert]], who worked at [[San Marco di Venezia|St Mark's Basilica]]. Venice was the early center of music printing; [[Ottaviano Petrucci]] began publishing music almost as soon as this technology was available, and his publishing enterprise helped to attract composers from all over Europe, especially from France and [[Flanders]]. By the end of the century, Venice was known for the splendor of its music, as exemplified in the \"colossal style\" of [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], which used multiple choruses and instrumental groups. Venice was also the home of many noted composers during the [[baroque music|baroque period]], such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Ippolito Ciera]], [[Giovanni Picchi]], and [[Girolamo Dalla Casa]], to name but a few.\n\n==== Orchestras ====\nVenice is the home of numerous symphony orchestras such as, the [[La Fenice|Orchestra della Fenice]], [[Rond\u00f2 Veneziano]], Interpreti Veneziani, and [[Venice Baroque Orchestra]].\n\n=== Cinema, media, and popular culture ===\n[[File:65th venice film festival.jpg|thumb|The [[Venice Film Festival]] is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the most prestigious and publicized.<ref name=VeniceFilmFest>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-lineup-720770|title=Venice: David Gordon Green's 'Manglehorn,' Abel Ferrara's 'Pasolini' in Competition Lineup|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Anderson|first=Ariston|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218220740/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-lineup-720770|archivedate=18 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3291348/addio-lido-last-postcards-from-the-venice-film-festival/|title=Addio, Lido: Last Postcards from the Venice Film Festival|work=Time |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920162423/http://time.com/3291348/addio-lido-last-postcards-from-the-venice-film-festival/|archivedate=20 September 2014}}</ref>]]\nVenice has been the setting or chosen location of numerous films, games, works of fine art and literature (including essays, fiction, non-fiction, and poems), music videos, television shows, and other cultural references.\n\n==== In films ====\nExamples of films set or at least partially filmed in Venice include:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/galleries/venice-in-the-movies-filming-locations/venicefilm4/|title=Venice in the movies: 10 films that feature the city|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Summertime (1955 film)|Summertime]]'' (1955), starring [[Katharine Hepburn]]\n* Three [[James Bond]] films: ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979), and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006)\n* [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Death in Venice (film)|Death in Venice]]'' (1971)<ref>{{cite web|title=Death in Venice and a cocktail |url=http://www.thevenicelido.com/2011/08/death-in-venice-cocktail.html |website=The Venice Lido|date=August 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Blume in Love]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Fellini's Casanova]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[A Little Romance]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Dangerous Beauty]]'' (1988), the biography of [[Veronica Franco]]\n* ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[The Comfort of Strangers (film)|The Comfort of Strangers]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Blame It on the Bellboy]]'' (1992)\n* [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[The Wings of the Dove (1997 film)|The Wings of the Dove]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Heroes]]'' (2002), is set inside a city based on Venice, although it is titled differently and features sights not present within its real-world equivalent.

The name ''Venetia'', however, derives from the Roman name for the people known as the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]], and called by the Greeks ''Enetoi'' (\u1f18\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af). The meaning of the word is uncertain, although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names, such as the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Celtic Veneti]] and the [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Vistula Veneti]]. Linguists suggest that the name is based on an [[protoindoeuropean|Indo-European]] root *''wen'' (\"love\"), so that *''wenetoi'' would mean \"beloved\", \"lovable\", or \"friendly\". A connection with the Latin word ''venetus'', meaning the color 'sea-blue', is also possible.\nSupposed connections of ''Venetia'' with the Latin verb ''venire'' (to come), such as [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marin Sanudo]]'s ''veni etiam'' (\"Yet, I have come!\"), the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland, or even with ''venia'' (\"forgiveness\") [[folk etymology|are fanciful]].

This part of Roman Italy was again overrun in the early 5th century by the [[Visigoths]] and, some 50&nbsp;years later, by the Huns led by [[Attila]]. The last and most enduring immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula, that of the [[Lombards]] in 568, left the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] only a small strip of coastline in the current Veneto, including Venice. The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], administered from that ancient port and overseen by a viceroy (the [[Exarch]]) appointed by the Emperor in [[Constantinople]]. Ravenna and Venice were connected only by sea routes, and with the Venetians' isolation came increasing autonomy. New ports were built, including those at [[Malamocco]] and [[Torcello]] in the Venetian lagoon. The ''tribuni maiores'' formed the earliest central standing governing committee of the islands in the lagoon, dating from c.&nbsp;568.<ref>Traditional date as given in William J. Langer, ed.

Some modern historians claim Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually the [[Paul (exarch)|Exarch Paul]], and Paul's successor, [[Marcello Tegalliano]], was Paul's ''[[magister militum]]'' (or \"general\"), literally \"master of soldiers\". In 726 the soldiers and citizens of the exarchate rose in a rebellion over the [[iconoclastic controversy]], at the urging of [[Pope Gregory II]]. The exarch, held responsible for the acts of his master, Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], was murdered, and many officials were put to flight in the chaos. At about this time, the people of the lagoon elected their own independent leader for the first time, although the relationship of this to the uprisings is not clear. [[Orso Ipato|Ursus]] was the first of 117 \"[[Doge of Venice|doges]]\" (''doge'' is the [[Venetian language|Venetian dialectal]] equivalent of the Latin ''[[dux]]'' (\"leader\"); the corresponding word in English is [[duke]], in standard Italian ''duca''.  (See also \"[[duce]]\".) Whatever his original views, Ursus supported Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]]'s successful military expedition to recover Ravenna, sending both men and ships. In recognition of this, Venice was \"granted numerous privileges and concessions\" and Ursus, who had personally taken the field, was confirmed by Leo as ''[[dux]]''.<ref>[[John Julius Norwich]].

During this period, the seat of the local Byzantine governor (the \"duke/dux\", later \"doge\"), was at [[Malamocco]]. Settlement on the islands in the lagoon probably increased with the Lombard conquest of other Byzantine territories, as refugees sought asylum in the area. In 775/6, the [[bishop|episcopal]] seat of Olivolo ([[San Pietro di Castello]], namely Helipolis{{citation needed |date=August 2015}}) was created. During the reign of duke [[Agnello Particiaco]] (811\u2013827) the ducal seat moved from Malamocco to the more protected Rialto, within present-day Venice. The monastery of St.&nbsp;Zachary and the first [[Doge's Palace, Venice|ducal palace]] and [[basilica of St. Mark]], as well as a walled defense (''civitatis murus'') between Olivolo and Rialto, were subsequently built here.\n\n[[Charlemagne]] sought to subdue the city to his rule. He ordered the pope to expel the Venetians from the [[Pentapolis]] along the Adriatic coast;<ref>Langer</ref> Charlemagne's own son [[Pepin of Italy]], [[king of the Lombards]], under the authority of his father, embarked on a siege of Venice itself. This, however, proved a costly failure. The siege lasted six months, with Pepin's army ravaged by the diseases of the local swamps and eventually forced to withdraw in 810. A few months later, Pepin himself died, apparently as a result of a disease contracted there. In the aftermath, an agreement between [[Charlemagne]] and the Byzantine Emperor [[Nikephoros I Logothetes|Nicephorus]] in 814 recognized Venice as Byzantine territory, and granted the city trading rights along the Adriatic coast.\n\nIn 828 the new city's prestige increased with the acquisition, from [[Alexandria]], of relics claimed to be of [[St Mark the Evangelist]]; these were placed in the new basilica. Winged lions\u2014visible throughout Venice\u2014are the [[Four Evangelists#Symbols|emblem of St Mark]].  The patriarchal seat was also moved to Rialto.

The doge already possessed the titles of Duke of [[Dalmatia]] and Duke of [[Istria]]. Later mainland possessions, which extended across [[Lake Garda]] as far west as the [[Adda River]], were known as the ''Terraferma''; they were acquired partly as a buffer against belligerent neighbours, partly to guarantee [[Alps|Alpine]] trade routes, and partly to ensure the supply of mainland wheat (on which the city depended).

In the first chrysobull, Venice acknowledged its homage to the empire; but not in the second, reflecting the decline of [[Byzantium]] and the rise of Venice's power.<ref>Herrin, Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire, Penguin, Harmondsworth, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103102-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=fqa |title=History of Venice |publisher=Historyworld.net |accessdate=28 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nVenice became an imperial power following the [[Fourth Crusade]], which, having veered off course, culminated in 1204 by capturing and sacking [[Constantinople]] and establishing the [[Latin Empire]]. As a result of this conquest, considerable Byzantine plunder was brought back to Venice. This plunder included the [[Horses of Saint Mark|gilt bronze horses]] from the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], which were originally placed above the entrance to the cathedral of Venice, [[St Mark's Basilica]] (The originals have been replaced with replicas, and are now stored within the basilica.)  After the fall of Constantinople, the former Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned among the Latin crusaders and the Venetians. Venice subsequently carved out a sphere of influence in the Mediterranean known as the [[Duchy of the Archipelago]], and captured Crete.<ref>Thomas F.

By the late 13th century, Venice was the most prosperous city in all of Europe. At the peak of its power and wealth, it had 36,000 sailors operating 3,300 ships, dominating Mediterranean commerce. Venice's leading families vied with each other to build the grandest palaces and to support the work of the greatest and most talented artists. The city was governed by the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]], which was made up of members of the noble families of Venice. The Great Council appointed all public officials, and elected a Senate of 200 to 300 individuals. Since this group was too large for efficient administration, a [[Council of Ten]] (also called the Ducal Council, or the Signoria), controlled much of the administration of the city. One member of the great council was elected \"[[doges of Venice|doge]]\", or duke, to be the chief executive; he would usually hold the title until his death, although several Doges were forced, by pressure from their [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] peers, to resign and retire into [[monastery|monastic]] seclusion, when they were felt to have been discredited by political failure.\n\nThe Venetian governmental structure was similar in some ways to the republican system of ancient Rome, with <!-- \n1 -->an elected chief executive (the doge), <!-- \n2 -->a senator-like assembly of nobles, and <!-- \n3 -->the general citizenry with limited political power, who originally had the power to grant or withhold their approval of each newly elected doge. \nChurch and various private properties were tied to military service, although there was no knight tenure within the city itself. \nThe ''Cavalieri di San Marco'' was the only order of [[chivalry]] ever instituted in Venice, and no citizen could accept or join a foreign order without the government's consent. \nVenice remained a republic throughout its independent period, \nand politics and the military were kept separate, \nexcept when on occasion the Doge personally headed the military. \nWar was regarded as a continuation of commerce by other means \n(whence, \nthe city's early employment of large numbers of mercenaries for service elsewhere, and \nlater its reliance on foreign mercenaries when the ruling class was preoccupied with commerce\n).\n\n[[File:Gaspar van Wittel - View of the San Marco Basin.JPG|thumb|View of [[San Marco basin]] in 1697]]\n[[File:Canaletto Grand Canal from Palazzo Flangini - JPGM.jpg|thumb|''[[The Grand Canal in Venice from Palazzo Flangini to Campo San Marcuola]]'', [[Canaletto]], circa 1738, [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]]]\n\nAlthough the people of Venice generally remained orthodox Roman Catholics, \nthe state of Venice was notable for its freedom from religious fanaticism, \nand executed nobody for religious heresy during the [[Counter-Reformation]]. \nThis apparent lack of zeal contributed to Venice's frequent conflicts with the [[papacy]]. \nIn this context, the writings of the Anglican divine [[William Bedell]] are particularly illuminating. \nVenice was threatened with the [[interdict]] on a number of occasions \nand twice suffered its imposition. \nThe second, most noted, occasion was in 1606, by order of [[Pope Paul V]].\n\nThe newly invented German [[printing press]] spread rapidly throughout Europe in the 15th century, and Venice was quick to adopt it. \nBy 1482, Venice was the printing capital of the world; \nthe leading printer was [[Aldus Manutius]], who invented paperback books that could be carried in a saddlebag.\n\nHis ''Aldine Editions'' included translations of nearly all the known Greek manuscripts of the \nera.<ref>James Burke, ''Connections'' (Little, Brown and Co., 1978/1995, {{ISBN|978-0-316-11672-5}}, p.105</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\n[[File:The Grand Canal, Venice c1760 Francesco Guardi.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Guardi]], ''The Grand Canal'', circa 1760 ([[Art Institute of Chicago]])]]\n\nVenice's long decline started in the 15th century, when it first made an unsuccessful [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422\u20131430)|attempt to hold Thessalonica]] against the Ottomans (1423\u20131430). It also sent ships to help defend Constantinople against the besieging Turks (1453). After [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell]] to [[Sultan Mehmed II]], he declared the first of a series of [[Ottoman-Venetian wars]] that cost Venice much of its eastern Mediterranean possessions. Even more decisive than the [[Columbian exchange]] and the beginning of Atlantic trade following Christopher Columbus's voyage of 1492 was [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first voyage of 1497\u201399, which opened a sea route to India around the Cape of Good Hope and destroyed Venice's monopoly. France, England, and the Dutch Republic quickly followed Spain and Portugal, but Venice's oared galleys were at a disadvantage when it came to traversing the great oceans, and therefore Venice was left behind in the race for colonies.\n\nThe [[Black Death]] devastated Venice in 1348, and once again between 1575 and 1577.<ref>William J.

But the Republic lost its independence when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] conquered Venice on 12 May 1797 during the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Napoleon was seen as something of a liberator by the city's Jewish population. He removed the gates of the [[Venetian Ghetto|Ghetto]] and ended the restrictions on when and where Jews could live and travel in the city.\n\nVenice became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] on 12 October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. Venice was taken from Austria by the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]. In 1848 a revolt briefly re-established the [[Repubblica di San Marco|Venetian republic]] under [[Daniele Manin]], but this was crushed in 1849. In 1866, after the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], Venice, along with the rest of the Veneto, became part of the newly created [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].\n\n[[File:Morning Impression along a Canal in Venice.JPG|thumb|''Morning Impression along a Canal in Venice, Veneto, Italy'' by [[Rafail Levitsky]] (1896)]]\n[[Image:View from the Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri), Venice Italy.jpg|thumb|View from the Bridge of Sighs]]\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the historic city was largely free from attack, the only aggressive effort of note being [[Operation Bowler]], a successful [[Royal Air Force]] precision strike on the German naval operations in the city in March 1945.

Six hundred years ago, Venetians protected themselves from land-based attacks by diverting all the major rivers flowing into the lagoon and thus preventing sediment from filling the area around the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/venice/sieg_nf.html|title=NOVA &#124; Sinking City of Venice &#124; Venice Under Siege (non-Flash) &#124; PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> This created an ever-deeper lagoon environment.\n\nIn 1604, to defray the cost of flood relief, Venice introduced what could be considered the first example of a \"[[stamp tax]]\".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} When the revenue fell short of expectations in 1608, Venice introduced paper, with the superscription \"AQ\" and imprinted instructions, which was to be used for \"letters to officials\". At first, this was to be a temporary tax, but it remained in effect until the fall of the Republic in 1797. Shortly after the introduction of the tax, Spain produced similar paper for general taxation purposes, and the practice spread to other countries.\n\nDuring the 20th century, when many [[artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] were sunk into the periphery of the lagoon to draw water for local industry, Venice began to [[subsidence|subside]]. It was realized that extraction of water from the [[aquifer]] was the cause. The sinking has slowed markedly since artesian wells were banned in the 1960s. However, the city is still threatened by more frequent low-level floods\u2014the ''[[Acqua alta]]'', that rise to a height of several centimetres over its quays\u2014regularly following certain tides. In many old houses, staircases once used to unload goods are now flooded, rendering the former ground floor uninhabitable.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nStudies indicate that the city continues sinking at a relatively slow rate of 1\u20132{{nbsp}}mm per annum;<ref>{{cite report |last1=Bock |first1=Y. |display-authors=etal |title=Recent Subsidence of the Venice Lagoon from Continuous GPS and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar |url=http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/files/venise-senfonce.pdf |date=2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124453/http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/files/venise-senfonce.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |access-date=23 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.venezia.it/archivio/EN/1844 |title=City of Venice \u2013 Subsidence and eustatism |work=comune.venezia.it|date=3 April 2017 }}</ref> therefore, the state of alert has not been revoked. \n\nIn May 2003, Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] inaugurated the [[MOSE Project]] (''Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico''), an experimental model for evaluating the performance of hollow floatable gates; the idea is to fix a series of 78 hollow [[pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] to the sea bed across the three entrances to the lagoon.

Although there is little specific information about the earliest years, it is likely that an important source of the city's prosperity was the trade in slaves, captured in central Europe and sold to North Africa and the Levant. Venice's location at the head of the Adriatic, and directly south of the terminus of the [[Brenner Pass]] over the Alps, would have given it a distinct advantage as a middleman in this important trade. In the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Venice was a major center for commerce and trade, as it controlled a vast sea-empire, and became an extremely wealthy European city and a leader in political and economic affairs,.<ref name=\"aboutvenice.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutvenice.org/economy-of-venice.html |title=The economy of Venice, Italy |publisher=Aboutvenice.org | accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> From the 11th century until the 15th century, [[pilgrimage]]s to the [[Holy Land]] were offered in Venice.

Beyond these rail and road terminals on the northern edge of the city, transportation within the city's historic centre remains, as it was in centuries past, entirely on water or on foot. Venice is Europe's largest urban [[Auto-free zones|car-free area]] and is unique in Europe in having remained a sizable functioning city in the 21st century entirely without motorcars or trucks.\n\nThe classic Venetian boat is the ''[[gondola]]'', (plural: ''gondole'') although it is now mostly used for tourists, or for weddings, funerals, or other ceremonies, or as ''traghetti'' (sing.: traghetto) to cross the Grand Canal in lieu of a nearby bridge. The traghetti are operated by two oarsmen. For some years there were seven such boats; but by 2017, only three remained.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/veneto/venice/articles/venice-attractions/|title=Venice attractions|first=Anne|last=Hanley|date=10 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThere are approximately 400 licensed gondoliers in Venice, in their distinctive livery, and a similar number of boats, down from 10,000 two centuries ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/11/the-right-stripes-how-fashion-fell-for-the-gondolier|title=The right stripes: how fashion fell for the gondolier|first=Morwenna|last=Ferrier|date=11 August 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref name=\"ricksteves.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/the-gondolas-of-venice|title=The Gondolas of Venice \u2013 Rick Steves' Europe|website=www.ricksteves.com}}</ref> Many gondolas are lushly appointed with crushed velvet seats and Persian rugs. At the front of each gondola that works in the city, there is a large piece of metal called the ''f\u00e8ro'' (iron). Its shape has evolved through the centuries, as documented in many well-known paintings. Its form, topped by a likeness of the Doge's hat, became gradually standardized, and was then fixed by local law. It consists of six bars pointing forward representing the sestieri of the city, and one that points backwards representing the [[Giudecca]].<ref name=\"ricksteves.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelsantelena.com/blog/visit-venice-through-gondolas-symbolism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 June 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609022508/http://www.hotelsantelena.com/blog/visit-venice-through-gondolas-symbolism/ |archivedate=9 June 2017  }}</ref> A lesser-known boat is the smaller, simpler, but similar, [[sandolo]].\n\n==== Waterways ====\n[[File:Rialto Gondoliers.jpg|thumb|[[Rialto Bridge]]]]\n\nVenice's small islands were enhanced during the Middle Ages by the dredging of soil to raise the marshy ground above the tides. The resulting canals encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city. Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city.\n\nThe maze of canals threading through the city requires more than 400 bridges to permit the flow of foot traffic. In 2011, the city opened the [[Ponte della Costituzione]], the fourth bridge across the Grand Canal, which connects the [[Piazzale Roma]] bus-terminal area with the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station. The other bridges are the original [[Ponte di Rialto]], the [[Ponte dell'Accademia]], and the [[Ponte degli Scalzi]].\n\n=== Public transport ===\n[[Azienda del Consorzio Trasporti Veneziano]] (ACTV) is a public company responsible for public transportation in Venice.\n\n==== Lagoon area ====\n[[File:Vaporetti Venice Lagoon.jpg|thumb|Vaporetti on the Grand Canal]]\n\nThe main means of public transportation consists of motorised [[waterbus]]es (''[[vaporetto|vaporetti]]'') which ply regular routes along the Grand Canal and between the city's islands. Private motorised water taxis are also active. The only gondole still in common use by Venetians are the ''traghetti'', foot passenger [[ferry|ferries]] crossing the Grand Canal at certain points where there are no convenient bridges. Other gondole are rented by tourists on an hourly basis.<ref name=\"ricksteves.com\"/>\n\nThe [[Venice People Mover]] is an elevated shuttle train [[public transit]] system connecting [[Tronchetto island]] with its car parking facility with Piazzale Roma where visitors arrive in the city by bus, taxi, or automobile. The train makes a stop at the Marittima cruise terminal at the [[Port of Venice]].<ref>https://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/venice-people-mover.htm, Venice People Mover (2019)</ref>\n\n==== Lido and Pellestrina islands ====\n[[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Pellestrina]] are two islands forming a barrier between the southern Venetian Lagoon and the Adriatic Sea. On those islands, road traffic, including bus service, is allowed. Vaporetti link them with other islands (Venice, [[Murano]], [[Burano]]) and with the peninsula of [[Cavallino-Treporti]].\n\n==== Mainland ====\nThe mainland of Venice is composed of 5 boroughs: [[Mestre]]-Carpenedo, [[Marghera]], Chirignago-Zelarino, and Favaro Veneto. Mestre is the center and the most populous urban area of the mainland. There are several bus routes and two [[Translohr]] [[Trams in Mestre|tramway lines]]. Several bus routes and one of the tramway lines link the mainland with ''[[Piazzale Roma]]'', the main bus station in Venice, via [[Ponte della Libert\u00e0]], the road bridge connecting the mainland with the group of islands that comprise the historic center of Venice.\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Venice, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 52 min. Only 12.2% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 10 min, while 17.6% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.

Polo (1254\u20131324) was a merchant who voyaged to [[the Orient]]. His series of books, co-written with [[Rustichello da Pisa]] and titled ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]'' provided important knowledge of the lands east of Europe, from the Middle East to China, Japan, and Russia. [[Giacomo Casanova]] (1725\u20131798) was a prolific writer and adventurer best remembered for his autobiography, ''Histoire De Ma Vie'' (''Story of My Life''), which links his colourful lifestyle to the city of Venice.\n\n[[File:Venice city scenes - on the Grand Canal - Polizia! (11002248065).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Santa Maria della Salute]]]]\n\nVenetian playwrights followed the old Italian theatre tradition of ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''. [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzante]] (1502\u20131542), [[Carlo Goldoni]] (1707\u20131793), and [[Carlo Gozzi]] (1720\u20131806) used the Venetian dialect extensively in their comedies.\n\nVenice has also inspired writers from abroad. Shakespeare set ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' in the city, as did [[Thomas Mann]] his novel, ''[[Death in Venice]]'' (1912). The French writer [[Philippe Sollers]] spent most of his life in Venice and published '' A Dictionary For Lovers of Venice'' in 2004.\n\nThe city features prominently in [[Henry James]]'s ''[[The Aspern Papers]]'' and ''[[The Wings of the Dove]]''. It is also visited in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' and [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. Perhaps the best-known children's book set in Venice is ''The Thief Lord'', written by the German author [[Cornelia Funke]].\n\nThe poet [[Ugo Foscolo]] (1778\u20131827), born in [[Zakynthos|Zante]], an island that at the time belonged to the Republic of Venice, was also a [[revolutionary]] who wanted to see a free republic established in Venice following its fall to [[Napoleon]].\n\nVenice also inspired the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]], who wrote his first literary work in the city. Pound died in 1972, and his remains are buried in Venice's [[:commons:Category:Cimitero di San Michele (Venice)|cemetery island]] of [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele]].\n\nVenice is also linked to the technological aspects of writing. The city was the location of one of Italy's earliest printing presses called [[Aldine Press]], established by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1494.<ref name=\"Aldus and His Dream Book\">{{cite book|last1=Barolini|first1=Helen|title=Aldus and His Dream Book|date=1992|publisher=Italica Press, Inc.|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-934977-22-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.triposo.com/loc/Venice/culture/background|title=Venice Culture|website=www.triposo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> From this beginning Venice developed as an important typographic center. Around fifteen percent of all printing of the fifteenth century came from Venice,<ref>John Rylands University library Machester, ''The introduction of printing in Italy: Rome, Naples and Venice''</ref> and even as late as the 18th century was responsible for printing half of Italy's published books.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n==== In literature and adapted works ====\nThe city is a particularly popular setting for essays, novels, and other works of fictional or non-fictional literature. Examples of these include:\n* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'' ({{circa|1596\u20131598}}) and ''[[Othello]]'' (1603).\n* [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605\u20136).\n* [[Casanova]]'s autobiographical [[Histoire de ma vie|''History of My Life'']] {{circa|1789\u20131797}}.\n* [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' (1759).\n* [[Italo Calvino]]'s [[Invisible Cities]] (1972).\n* [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Cry to Heaven]]'' (1982).\n* [[Donna Leon]]'s Commissario Guido Brunetti [[crime fiction]] series and cookbook, and the German television series based on the novels (1992\u20132019).\n* [[Philippe Sollers]]' ''[[Watteau in Venice]]'' (1994).\n* [[Michael Dibdin]]'s ''[[Dead Lagoon]]'' (1994), one in a series of novels featuring Venice-born policeman Aurelio Zen.\n* [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s ''[[Kushiel's Chosen]]'' (2002), an [[historical fantasy]] or [[alternate history]] of Venice\u2014complete with masquerades, canals, and a doge\u2014taking place in a city known as La Serenissima.\n\nAdditionally, [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'' (1912), was the basis for Benjamin Britten's [[Death in Venice (opera)|eponymous opera]] (1973).\n\n==== Foreign words of Venetian origin ====\nSome words with a Venetian etymology include [[:wikt:arsenal|arsenal]], [[:wikt:ciao|ciao]], [[:wikt:ghetto|ghetto]], [[:wikt:gondola|gondola]], [[:wikt:imbroglio|imbroglio]], [[:wikt:lagoon|lagoon]], [[:wikt:lazaret|lazaret]], [[:wikt:lido|lido]], [[:wikt:Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[:wikt:regatta|regatta]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign words of Venetian origination|author=Hannah Fielding|date=9 November 2013|website=hannahfielding.net|url=http://hannahfielding.net/foreign-words-of-venetian-origin/}}</ref>\n\n=== Printing ===\nBy the end of the 15th century, Venice had become the European capital of printing, having 417 printers by 1500, and being one of the first cities in Italy (after Subiaco and Rome) to have a printing press, after those established in Germany. The most important printing office was the [[Aldine Press]] of [[Aldus Manutius]]; which in 1497 issued the first printed work of [[Aristotle]]; in 1499 printed the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', considered the most beautiful book of the [[Renaissance]]; and established modern [[punctuation]], page format, and [[italic type]].\n\n=== Painting ===\n{{Main|List of painters and architects of Venice}}\n{{See also|Venetian School (art)}}\n[[File:Canaletto - Bucentaur's return to the pier by the Palazzo Ducale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century view of Venice by Venetian artist [[Canaletto]].]]\n\nVenice, especially during the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], and [[Baroque]] periods, was a major centre of art and developed a unique style known as the [[Venetian School (art)|Venetian School]]. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Venice, along with [[Florence]] and Rome, became one of the most important centres of art in Europe, and numerous wealthy Venetians became patrons of the arts. Venice at the time was a rich and prosperous [[Maritime Republics|Maritime Republic]], which controlled a vast sea and trade empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/arthistory10one/a/ven_ren.htm |title=The Renaissance in Venice \u2013 Art History Basics on the Venetian School \u2013 ca 1450\u20131600 |publisher=Arthistory.about.com |date=29 October 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, Venetian painting was developed through influences from the Paduan School and [[Antonello da Messina]], who introduced the oil painting technique of the [[Van Eyck]] brothers. It is signified by a warm colour scale and a picturesque use of colour. Early masters were the Bellini and Vivarini families, followed by [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian]], then [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. In the early 16th century, there was rivalry in Venetian painting between the ''disegno'' and ''colorito'' techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/feast/context/venetianart.html |title=Venetian art around 1500 |publisher=Webexhibits.org |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Canvas]]es (the common painting surface) originated in Venice during the early Renaissance. These early canvases were generally rough.\n\nIn the 18th century, Venetian painting had a revival with [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]'s decorative painting and [[Canaletto]]'s and [[Guardi]]'s panoramic views.\n\n=== Venetian architecture ===\n{{main|Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian Renaissance architecture}}\n[[File:Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti WB.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti]] is an example of Venetian Gothic architecture alongside the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].]]\n[[File:Ca' d'Oro facciata.jpg|thumb|The [[Ca' d'Oro]].]]\n\nVenice is built on unstable mud-banks, and had a very crowded city centre by the Middle Ages. On the other hand, the city was largely safe from riot, civil feuds, and invasion much earlier than most European cities. These factors, with the canals and the great wealth of the city, made for unique building styles.\n  \nVenice has a rich and diverse [[architectural style]], the most prominent of which is the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. [[Venetian Gothic architecture]] is a term given to a Venetian building style combining the use of the Gothic [[lancet window|lancet arch]] with the curved [[ogee arch]], due to [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] influences. The style originated in 14th-century Venice, with a confluence of [[Byzantine]] style from [[Constantinople]], Islamic influences from [[Islamic Spain|Spain]] and Venice's eastern trading partners, and early Gothic forms from mainland Italy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Chief examples of the style are the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] and the [[Ca' d'Oro]] in the city. The city also has several [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] buildings, including the [[Ca' Pesaro]] and the [[Ca' Rezzonico]].\n\nVenetian taste was conservative and [[Renaissance architecture]] only really became popular in buildings from about the 1470s.  More than in the rest of Italy, it kept much of the typical form of the Gothic ''palazzi'', which had evolved to suit Venetian conditions. In turn the transition to [[Baroque architecture]] was also fairly gentle. This gives the crowded buildings on the Grand Canal and elsewhere an essential harmony, even where buildings from very different periods sit together. For example, round-topped arches are far more common in Renaissance buildings than elsewhere.\n  \n[[File:Hotel Danieli-dandolo 2012.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Dandolo]].]]\n[[File:Ca' Rezzonico (Venice).jpg|thumb|The [[Baroque]] [[Ca' Rezzonico]].]]\n\n=== Rococo style ===\nIt can be argued that Venice produced the best and most refined [[Rococo]] designs. At the time, the Venitian economy was in decline.  It had lost most of its maritime power, was lagging behind its rivals in political importance, and its society had become decadent, with tourism increasingly the mainstay of the economy. But Venice remained a centre of fashion.<ref name=\"Miller 2005 p.82\">Miller (2005) p.82</ref> Venetian rococo was well known as rich and luxurious, with usually very extravagant designs. Unique Venetian furniture types included the ''divani da portego'', and long rococo couches and ''pozzetti'', objects meant to be placed against the wall. Bedrooms of rich Venetians were usually sumptuous and grand, with rich damask, velvet, and silk drapery and curtains, and beautifully carved rococo beds with statues of [[putti]], flowers, and angels.<ref name=\"Miller 2005 p.82\" /> Venice was especially known for its beautiful [[Girandole|girandole mirrors]], which remained among, if not the, finest in Europe. Chandeliers were usually very colourful, using [[Murano glass]] to make them look more vibrant and stand out from others; and precious stones and materials from abroad were used, since Venice still held a vast trade empire. Lacquer was very common, and many items of furniture were covered with it, the most noted being ''lacca povera'' (poor lacquer), in which allegories and images of social life were painted. Lacquerwork and [[Chinoiserie]] were particularly common in bureau cabinets.<ref>Miller (2005) p.83</ref>\n\n=== Glass ===\n{{Main|Venetian glass}}\n\nVenice is known for its ornate glass-work, known as [[Venetian glass]], which is world-renowned for being colourful, elaborate, and skilfully made.\n\n[[File:Lampadario in vetro di Murano - Ca' Rezzonico, Venice.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Murano glass]] [[chandelier]] [[Ca'&nbsp;Rezzonico]] ]]\n\nMany of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the 13th century. Toward the end of that century, the center of the Venetian glass industry moved to [[Murano]], an offshore island in Venice. The glass made there is known as [[Murano glass]].\n\n[[File:Venetian glass goblet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Venetian glass]] [[goblet]] ]]\n\nByzantine craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass. When [[Constantinople]] was sacked in the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice. This happened again when the [[Ottomans]] took Constantinople in 1453, supplying Venice with still more glassworkers. By the 16th century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the color and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques.\n\nDespite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.\n\nSome of the most important brands of glass in the world today are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. They are: Venini, Barovier & Toso, [[Pauly & C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]], Millevetri, and Seguso.<ref>Carl I. Gable,\n''Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists'' (Schiffer, 2004). {{ISBN|978-0-7643-1946-4}}.</ref> Barovier & Toso is considered one of the 100 [[List of oldest companies|oldest companies]] in the world, formed in 1295.\n\n=== Festivals ===\n{{See also|Carnival of Venice|Venice Film Festival}}\n{{multiple image | align = right | total_width = 420 | direction = horizontal\n| width1 =300 | image1 = Carnevale di Venezia Masks 2010.jpg | alt1 =\n| width2 = 300 | image2 = VeniceShopWindow.jpg| alt2 = Map\n| footer = Typical [[Venetian mask|masks]] worn during the [[Carnival of Venice]].}}\n\nThe [[Carnival of Venice]] is held annually in the city, It lasts for around two weeks and ends on [[Shrove Tuesday]].

The Venetian state \u2013 i.e., the medieval [[Republic of Venice]] \u2013 was often popularly called the \"Republic of Music\", and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that \"In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere.\"<ref>Touring Club p. 79</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century, Venice became one of the most important musical centers of Europe, marked by a characteristic style of composition (the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]]) and the development of the [[Venetian polychoral style]] under composers such as [[Adrian Willaert]], who worked at [[San Marco di Venezia|St Mark's Basilica]]. Venice was the early center of music printing; [[Ottaviano Petrucci]] began publishing music almost as soon as this technology was available, and his publishing enterprise helped to attract composers from all over Europe, especially from France and [[Flanders]]. By the end of the century, Venice was known for the splendor of its music, as exemplified in the \"colossal style\" of [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], which used multiple choruses and instrumental groups. Venice was also the home of many noted composers during the [[baroque music|baroque period]], such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Ippolito Ciera]], [[Giovanni Picchi]], and [[Girolamo Dalla Casa]], to name but a few.\n\n==== Orchestras ====\nVenice is the home of numerous symphony orchestras such as, the [[La Fenice|Orchestra della Fenice]], [[Rond\u00f2 Veneziano]], Interpreti Veneziani, and [[Venice Baroque Orchestra]].\n\n=== Cinema, media, and popular culture ===\n[[File:65th venice film festival.jpg|thumb|The [[Venice Film Festival]] is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the most prestigious and publicized.<ref name=VeniceFilmFest>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-lineup-720770|title=Venice: David Gordon Green's 'Manglehorn,' Abel Ferrara's 'Pasolini' in Competition Lineup|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Anderson|first=Ariston|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218220740/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-lineup-720770|archivedate=18 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3291348/addio-lido-last-postcards-from-the-venice-film-festival/|title=Addio, Lido: Last Postcards from the Venice Film Festival|work=Time |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920162423/http://time.com/3291348/addio-lido-last-postcards-from-the-venice-film-festival/|archivedate=20 September 2014}}</ref>]]\nVenice has been the setting or chosen location of numerous films, games, works of fine art and literature (including essays, fiction, non-fiction, and poems), music videos, television shows, and other cultural references.\n\n==== In films ====\nExamples of films set or at least partially filmed in Venice include:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/galleries/venice-in-the-movies-filming-locations/venicefilm4/|title=Venice in the movies: 10 films that feature the city|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Summertime (1955 film)|Summertime]]'' (1955), starring [[Katharine Hepburn]]\n* Three [[James Bond]] films: ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979), and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006)\n* [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Death in Venice (film)|Death in Venice]]'' (1971)<ref>{{cite web|title=Death in Venice and a cocktail |url=http://www.thevenicelido.com/2011/08/death-in-venice-cocktail.html |website=The Venice Lido|date=August 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Blume in Love]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[Fellini's Casanova]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[A Little Romance]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Dangerous Beauty]]'' (1988), the biography of [[Veronica Franco]]\n* ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[The Comfort of Strangers (film)|The Comfort of Strangers]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Blame It on the Bellboy]]'' (1992)\n* [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[The Wings of the Dove (1997 film)|The Wings of the Dove]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Heroes]]'' (2002), is set inside a city based on Venice, although it is titled differently and features sights not present within its real-world equivalent.

One of the nine playable characters, [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters#Silver the Hedgehog|Silver the Hedgehog]], was once a [[mink]] named \"Venice\" during development.

[[Fulvio Roiter]] has probably been the pioneer in artistic photography in Venice,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|last1=Stefano Biolchini|title=Addio a Fulvio Roiter.

Venice is not known for a peculiar cuisine of its own: it combines local traditions with influences stemming from age-old contacts with distant countries.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} These include ''sarde in sa\u00f3r'' (sardines marinated to preserve them for long voyages); ''bacal\u00e0 mantecato'' (a recipe based on Norwegian [[stockfish]] and extra-virgin olive oil); ''bis\u00e0to'' (marinated eel); ''risi e bisi'' \u2013 rice, peas and (unsmoked) bacon;<ref>Ranieri da Mosto, ''Il Veneto in cucina'', Firenze, Aldo Martello-Giunti, 1974, p. 57; Mari\u00f9 Salvatori de Zuliani, ''A tola co i nostri veci.

The Venetian Senate passed [[sumptuary law]]s, but these merely resulted in changes in fashion in order to circumvent the law. Dull garments were worn over colourful ones, which then were cut to show the hidden colours resulting in the spread of men's \"slashed\" fashions in the 15th century.\n\nToday, Venice is a major fashion and shopping centre; not as important as [[Milan]], [[Florence]], and Rome, but on a par with [[Verona]], [[Turin]], [[Vicenza]], [[Naples]], and [[Genoa]].
