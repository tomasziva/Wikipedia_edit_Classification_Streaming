He later became the [[Governor of Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]) where he is credited with the opening of several educational institutions accessible to the Indian population. Besides being a noted administrator, he wrote books on India and [[Afghanistan]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Dumbarton]], [[Dunbartonshire|Dumbartonshire]] (now [[Dunbartonshire]]) in 1779, and educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, he was the fourth son of the 11th [[Baron Elphinstone]] in the peerage of [[Scotland]]. Having been appointed to the civil service of the [[British East India Company]], of which one of his uncles was a director, he arrived at Calcutta (now Kolkata) early in 1796 where he filled several subordinate posts. In 1799, he escaped massacre in Benares (now [[Varanasi]]) by the followers of the deposed [[Nawab of Awadh]] [[Wazir Ali Khan]]. In 1801 he was transferred to the Diplomatic Service where he was posted as the assistant to the British resident at the court of the [[Peshwa]] ruler [[Baji Rao II]].\n\n==Envoy==\nIn the Peshwa court he obtained his first opportunity of distinction, being attached in the capacity of diplomatist to the mission of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]] to the [[Marathas]]. When, on the failure of negotiations, war broke out, Elphinstone, though a civilian, acted as virtual ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to Wellesley. At the [[Battle of Assaye]], and throughout the campaign, he displayed rare courage and knowledge of tactics such that Wellesley told him he ought to have been a soldier. In 1804, when the war ended, Elphinstone was appointed British resident at [[Nagpur]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Elphinstone, Mountstuart |volume=9 |pages=298\u2013299 |inline=1}}</ref> This gave him plenty of leisure time, which he spent in reading and study. Later, in 1807, he completed a short stint at [[Gwalior]].\n\nIn 1808 he was appointed the first British [[envoy (title)|envoy]] to the court of [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, with the object of securing a friendly alliance with the [[Afghan people|Afghans]] against [[Napoleon]]'s planned advance on [[India]].  However this proved of little value, because [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]] was driven from the throne by his brother before it could be ratified. The most valuable permanent result of the embassy was in Elphinstone's work titled ''Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its Dependencies in Persia and India'' (1815).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAfter spending about a year in Calcutta arranging the report of his mission, Elphinstone was appointed in 1811 to the important and difficult post of resident at [[Pune]] (formerly known as Poona). The difficulty arose from the general complication of Maratha politics, and especially from the weakness of the Peshwas, which Elphinstone rightly read from the first. The tenuous peace between the Peshwas was broken in 1817 with the Marathas declaring war on the British. Elphinstone assumed command of the military during an important crisis during the [[Battle of Khadki]] also called [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] and managed to secure a victory<ref name=EB1911/> despite his non-military background. As reparations, Peshwa territories were annexed by the British.
