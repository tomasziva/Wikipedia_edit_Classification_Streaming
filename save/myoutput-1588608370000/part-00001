name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> A [[Fante people|Fante]] native, Sey was a member of the Akona Ebiradze family of [[Anomabu]]-Biriwa-Moree and [[Cape Coast]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He had a humble background and was a [[Child neglect|neglected child]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> His father, Paapa Saah worked as a [[Carpentry|carpenter]] while his mother, Maame Abadua, was a farmer.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Jacob Sey had two brothers, Joseph Ewusi and Kwabena Wilson-Sey.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> As a child, Wilson-Sey, noted for his sense of humour, was nicknamed ''\"Kwaa Aboan\u2019nyi\"'', later shortened to ''\"Kwaa Bonyi\"'' the de facto village [[jester]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> From her meagre resources, Sey's mother gave him \u00a37 with which he bought a piece of land for farming at Asafura village on the outskirts of Biriwa. Due to extreme poverty, his illiterate parents were unable to afford [[Formal learning|formal education]], forcing Sey to join his father's carpentry workshop as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> To supplement his income, Jacob Sey went into palm wine tapping and [[palm oil]] manufacturing trade.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Later, Jacob Sey also mastered joinery to become a [[coffin]] vendor. Sey's coffin business flourished due to his acclaimed wit.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Acquisition of wealth ==\nPer historical narratives, Jacob Sey acquired his wealth in a ''\"manner that looked like a fairy tale, an African \u2018Aladdin Cave tale\u2019 and became one of the very, very few multi-millionaires in the whole of Africa.\"''<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn search of high quality palm fruits, Sey went to a farm between Asafura and Egyirfa, one moonlit night at a quarter to one in the morning when the entire village had retired to bed.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> A staunch [[Methodism|Methodist]], he usually sang [[hymn]]s on the way to his farm but he only murmured a short prayer this time around.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> At the farm he started climbing a palm tree atop a hill when he saw a snake coiled around the tree trunk and advancing in his direction.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He panicked and slipped, losing consciousness on impact to the ground.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> According to popular history, while he was in a comatose state, the voice of an apparition commanded him, \"''to wake up and go in peace and therefore show love and kindness to the needy.\"''<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> When he woke up, he chanced upon a shiny item in the dark and approached it apprehensively, only to discover a gold nugget.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nearby, there were several pots of gold dust as well.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nElated, he cordoned the place and smuggled the treasure to his house before sunrise.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is estimated that the large quantity of gold is equivalent to \u00a3200&nbsp;billion today.<ref name=\":0\" /> His newfound wealth literally made Sey a celebrity overnight.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> His sartorial taste changed from wearing a traditional [[African clothing|African cloth]] to Victorian [[Tailcoat|tail coats]], silk shirts, trousers and a [[fedora]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> His people now addressed him as Jacob Wilson-Sey, Esq.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Role in the Aboringes' Rights Protection Society ==\nJacob Sey cofounded and then became the first president of [[Gold Coast Aborigines' Rights Protection Society|Aborigines' Rights Protection Society]] (ARPS), formed to campaign and voice local opposition to the ''1897 Lands Bill'' being considered by the British colonial government.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Prominent members of the group were the [[upper-class]], Western-educated, wealthy elites who were comfortable with their indigenous roots, such as J. W. de Graft-Johnson, J. P. Brown, [[J. E. Casely Hayford]], and [[John Mensah Sarbah]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> On behalf of chiefs and people of the country, he led a delegation of the Society, consisting of Thomas Freeman together with Cape Coast merchants Edward Jones and George Hughes, to petition [[Queen Victoria]] to abrogate the Bill.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Sey fully funded the entire cost of the trip to London, including the hiring of a ship, the ''Alba''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The legislation was already listed in the ''Government's Gazette extra-ordinary'' No. 8, dated 10 March 1897.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The petition was necessitated by the fact that only two native members of the [[Parliament of Ghana|Gold Coast Legislative Council]] were unable to block the passage of the Bill due to lack of legislative powers and numerical advantage.<ref name=\":0\" /> Fifteen [[paramount chief]]<nowiki/>s and traditional regents on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] were signatories to the petition: Amonoo IV, King of Anomabu; Otu IV, King of Abura; Kwame Essandoh IV, King of Nkusukum; Badu Bonsa, King of Ahanta; Hima Denkyi, King Atta, King of Behin \u2013 Western Appolonia; Wiraku Atobura, King of Western Wassaw; Kwesi Ble, King of Atoabu, Eastern Appolonia; Nkwantabisa, King of Denkyira; Akyin II, King of Ekumfi; Kobina Kondua, King of Elmina; Kobina Hamah, King of Adjumaku and more than 64 Chiefs from the [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western]] and [[Central Region (Ghana)|Central]] provinces.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> This petition was received by the then [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph Chamberlin]] at [[10 Downing Street]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe ARPS had legal aid from a Sierra Leonean solicitor, Edward F. Hunt, with assistance from a team of barristers from a London-based law firm, Messrs. Ashurst, Crips Co., and a certain Mr. Corrie.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The ARPS deputation was successful in its appeal and returned to West Africa with a letter signed by Queen Victoria, effectively repealing the ''Lands Bill''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The team also returned with a gift of the Queen's bust that was later inaugurated at [[Cape Coast]]\u2019s Victoria Park by Princess Anne, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria during an official visit in 1925.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Sey encouraged the chiefs who had signed the petition to donate land for the establishment of other \"Victoria Parks\" in other Gold Coast cities and towns, including [[Saltpond]], [[Winneba]], [[Elmina]], [[Axim]], [[Accra]], [[Koforidua]] and [[Kibi, Ghana|Kyebi]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nAfter the successful mission, Jacob Wilson Sey dedicated the rest of his life to philanthropy to help improve the lives of his compatriots in [[Cape Coast]] and the Central Province.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> With the help of colonial civil servant and fellow ARPS member, [[John Mensah Sarbah]], Sey lobbied and negotiated with the colonial administration for a railway project at [[Cape Coast]] to enhance trade and commerce Sarbah was on good terms with several successive Governors: White, Griffith, Hodgson and Maxwell.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />  The government imposed certain conditionalities: \"If the native farmers from Cape Coast and the Central Province could produce an annual cocoa output of two tonnes within a certain time frame, the project will be initiated.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />  Sey and Sarbah injected personal cash to stimulate the growth of cocoa and palm oil farming but were ultimately unsuccessful in meeting the set conditions which would have required each farmer to increase production output by 5600 percent.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe British government built a wharf at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Sekondi]] that essentially altered the commercial dynamics on the coast as [[Cape Coast]] became a less thriving city.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prominent barristers such as [[J. E. Casely Hayford|Casely-Hayford]], Ribeiro, Charles Bannerman, [[Thomas Hutton-Mills Sr.|Hutton-Mills]], Renner and Sapara-Williams, of that era moved their law practices to other cities like [[Accra]], [[Axim]] and [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> To entice the return of these urban professionals, Sey acquired many old empty buildings in Cape Coast to be used on a rent-free basis, including Candle House, Commissariat House, de-Graft House, Palm House, Fordgate House No.2, PWD Building, Rose Pillars, Colonial School, Russel House, Standard Bank Building, and of the Court building, among others.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHe funded the efforts to bring back native chiefs in exile, [[Elmina]]\u2019s Kobena Gyan and the [[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]], [[Prempeh I]] from distant lands such as [[Seychelles]]. Sey also built a model of a palm wine pot at the city centre, a homage to his early beginnings and the connection to the acquisition of wealth.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHe financially supported the [[Methodist Church Ghana|Methodist Church]] in [[Cape Coast]] through the renovation of church buildings, funding of chorister robes, purchase of hymn books and church organs.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He opted to pay the remuneration of the church's missionaries and ministers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, he performed similar acts of benevolence to other [[Christian denomination]]s in [[Cape Coast]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Speaking style ==\nJacob Sey's speech style was that of a comedian and he habitually combined English and [[Fante dialect|Fanti]] words in his sentences.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> An example of this \"''Fantenglish''\" is ''\"The Epo Prams of the sea has nothing to do with Akesaw's Podise\" \u2013'' meaning ''\u2013 the high tides of the sea have nothing to do with a crablet.\"''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe was married to Agnes Charlotte Amba Kosimah Morgue.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Sey was a lifelong [[Methodism|Methodist]] and a regular churchgoer.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He was also known to have held prayer meetings in his home.<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Coastal_Elite_Architecture.html?id=Yi2snQEACAAJ|title=African Coastal Elite Architecture: Cultural Authentication During the Colonial Period in Anomabo, Ghana|last=Micots|first=Courtnay|date=2010|publisher=University of Florida|pages=413, 414|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011012740/https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Coastal_Elite_Architecture.html?id=Yi2snQEACAAJ|archive-date=2018-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n''<nowiki/>''\nJacob Wilson Sey died in his seventieth year in his home at [[Cape Coast]], on 22 May 1902.

name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> A [[Fante people|Fante]] native, Sey was a member of the Akona Ebiradze family of [[Anomabu]]-Biriwa-Moree and [[Cape Coast]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He had a humble background and was a [[Child neglect|neglected child]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> His father, Paapa Saah worked as a [[Carpentry|carpenter]] while his mother, Maame Abadua, was a farmer.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Jacob Sey had two brothers, Joseph Ewusi and Kwabena Wilson-Sey.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> As a child, Wilson-Sey, noted for his sense of humour, was nicknamed ''\"Kwaa Aboan\u2019nyi\"'', later shortened to ''\"Kwaa Bonyi\"'' the de facto village [[jester]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> From her meagre resources, Sey's mother gave him \u00a37 with which he bought a piece of land for farming at Asafura village on the outskirts of Biriwa. Due to extreme poverty, his illiterate parents were unable to afford [[Formal learning|formal education]], forcing Sey to join his father's carpentry workshop as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> To supplement his income, Jacob Sey went into palm wine tapping and [[palm oil]] manufacturing trade.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Later, Jacob Sey also mastered joinery to become a [[coffin]] vendor. Sey's coffin business flourished due to his acclaimed wit.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Acquisition of wealth ==\nPer historical narratives, Jacob Sey acquired his wealth in a ''\"manner that looked like a fairy tale, an African \u2018Aladdin Cave tale\u2019 and became one of the very, very few multi-millionaires in the whole of Africa.\"''<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn search of high quality palm fruits, Sey went to a farm between Asafura and Egyirfa, one moonlit night at a quarter to one in the morning when the entire village had retired to bed.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> A staunch [[Methodism|Methodist]], he usually sang [[hymn]]s on the way to his farm but he only murmured a short prayer this time around.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> At the farm he started climbing a palm tree atop a hill when he saw a snake coiled around the tree trunk and advancing in his direction.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He panicked and slipped, losing consciousness on impact to the ground.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> According to popular history, while he was in a comatose state, the voice of an apparition commanded him, \"''to wake up and go in peace and therefore show love and kindness to the needy.\"''<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> When he woke up, he chanced upon a shiny item in the dark and approached it apprehensively, only to discover a gold nugget.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nearby, there were several pots of gold dust as well.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nElated, he cordoned the place and smuggled the treasure to his house before sunrise.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is estimated that the large quantity of gold is equivalent to \u00a3200&nbsp;billion today.<ref name=\":0\" /> His newfound wealth literally made Sey a celebrity overnight.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> His sartorial taste changed from wearing a traditional [[African clothing|African cloth]] to Victorian [[Tailcoat|tail coats]], silk shirts, trousers and a [[fedora]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> His people now addressed him as Jacob Wilson-Sey, Esq.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Role in the Aboringes' Rights Protection Society ==\nJacob Sey cofounded and then became the first president of [[Gold Coast Aborigines' Rights Protection Society|Aborigines' Rights Protection Society]] (ARPS), formed to campaign and voice local opposition to the ''1897 Lands Bill'' being considered by the British colonial government.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Prominent members of the group were the [[upper-class]], Western-educated, wealthy elites who were comfortable with their indigenous roots, such as J. W. de Graft-Johnson, J. P. Brown, [[J. E. Casely Hayford]], and [[John Mensah Sarbah]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> On behalf of chiefs and people of the country, he led a delegation of the Society, consisting of Thomas Freeman together with Cape Coast merchants Edward Jones and George Hughes, to petition [[Queen Victoria]] to abrogate the Bill.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Sey fully funded the entire cost of the trip to London, including the hiring of a ship, the ''Alba''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The legislation was already listed in the ''Government's Gazette extra-ordinary'' No. 8, dated 10 March 1897.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The petition was necessitated by the fact that only two native members of the [[Parliament of Ghana|Gold Coast Legislative Council]] were unable to block the passage of the Bill due to lack of legislative powers and numerical advantage.<ref name=\":0\" /> Fifteen [[paramount chief]]<nowiki/>s and traditional regents on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] were signatories to the petition: Amonoo IV, King of Anomabu; Otu IV, King of Abura; Kwame Essandoh IV, King of Nkusukum; Badu Bonsa, King of Ahanta; Hima Denkyi, King Atta, King of Behin \u2013 Western Appolonia; Wiraku Atobura, King of Western Wassaw; Kwesi Ble, King of Atoabu, Eastern Appolonia; Nkwantabisa, King of Denkyira; Akyin II, King of Ekumfi; Kobina Kondua, King of Elmina; Kobina Hamah, King of Adjumaku and more than 64 Chiefs from the [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western]] and [[Central Region (Ghana)|Central]] provinces.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> This petition was received by the then [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph Chamberlin]] at [[10 Downing Street]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe ARPS had legal aid from a Sierra Leonean solicitor, Edward F. Hunt, with assistance from a team of barristers from a London-based law firm, Messrs. Ashurst, Crips Co., and a certain Mr. Corrie.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The ARPS deputation was successful in its appeal and returned to West Africa with a letter signed by Queen Victoria, effectively repealing the ''Lands Bill''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The team also returned with a gift of the Queen's bust that was later inaugurated at [[Cape Coast]]\u2019s Victoria Park by Princess Anne, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria during an official visit in 1925.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Sey encouraged the chiefs who had signed the petition to donate land for the establishment of other \"Victoria Parks\" in other Gold Coast cities and towns, including [[Saltpond]], [[Winneba]], [[Elmina]], [[Axim]], [[Accra]], [[Koforidua]] and [[Kibi, Ghana|Kyebi]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nAfter the successful mission, Jacob Wilson Sey dedicated the rest of his life to philanthropy to help improve the lives of his compatriots in [[Cape Coast]] and the Central Province.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> With the help of colonial civil servant and fellow ARPS member, [[John Mensah Sarbah]], Sey lobbied and negotiated with the colonial administration for a railway project at [[Cape Coast]] to enhance trade and commerce Sarbah was on good terms with several successive Governors: White, Griffith, Hodgson and Maxwell.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />  The government imposed certain conditionalities: \"If the native farmers from Cape Coast and the Central Province could produce an annual cocoa output of two tonnes within a certain time frame, the project will be initiated.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />  Sey and Sarbah injected personal cash to stimulate the growth of cocoa and palm oil farming but were ultimately unsuccessful in meeting the set conditions which would have required each farmer to increase production output by 5600 percent.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe British government built a wharf at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Sekondi]] that essentially altered the commercial dynamics on the coast as [[Cape Coast]] became a less thriving city.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prominent barristers such as [[J. E. Casely Hayford|Casely-Hayford]], Ribeiro, Charles Bannerman, [[Thomas Hutton-Mills Sr.|Hutton-Mills]], Renner and Sapara-Williams, of that era moved their law practices to other cities like [[Accra]], [[Axim]] and [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> To entice the return of these urban professionals, Sey acquired many old empty buildings in Cape Coast to be used on a rent-free basis, including Candle House, Commissariat House, de-Graft House, Palm House, Fordgate House No.2, PWD Building, Rose Pillars, Colonial School, Russel House, Standard Bank Building, and of the Court building, among others.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHe funded the efforts to bring back native chiefs in exile, [[Elmina]]\u2019s Kobena Gyan and the [[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]], [[Prempeh I]] from distant lands such as [[Seychelles]]. Sey also built a model of a palm wine pot at the city centre, a homage to his early beginnings and the connection to the acquisition of wealth.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHe financially supported the [[Methodist Church Ghana|Methodist Church]] in [[Cape Coast]] through the renovation of church buildings, funding of chorister robes, purchase of hymn books and church organs.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He opted to pay the remuneration of the church's missionaries and ministers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, he performed similar acts of benevolence to other [[Christian denomination]]s in [[Cape Coast]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Speaking style ==\nJacob Sey's speech style was that of a comedian and he habitually combined English and [[Fante dialect|Fanti]] words in his sentences.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> An example of this \"''Fantenglish''\" is ''\"The Epo Prams of the sea has nothing to do with Akesaw's Podise\" \u2013'' meaning ''\u2013 the high tides of the sea have nothing to do with a crablet.\"''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe was married to Agnes Charlotte Amba Kosimah Morgue.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Sey was a lifelong [[Methodism|Methodist]] and a regular churchgoer.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He was also known to have held prayer meetings in his home.<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Coastal_Elite_Architecture.html?id=Yi2snQEACAAJ|title=African Coastal Elite Architecture: Cultural Authentication During the Colonial Period in Anomabo, Ghana|last=Micots|first=Courtnay|date=2010|publisher=University of Florida|pages=413, 414|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011012740/https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Coastal_Elite_Architecture.html?id=Yi2snQEACAAJ|archive-date=2018-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n''<nowiki/>''\nJacob Wilson Sey died in his seventieth year in his home at [[Cape Coast]], on 22 May 1902.
