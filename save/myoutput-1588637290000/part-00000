In addition, he had been conducting an email campaign against numerous members of the university. He claimed fears of being killed in jail.\n\nOn 24 August 1992, Fabrikant took concealed weapons and ammunition with him to the Engineering Department of the university, where he went on a shooting spree on the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building. He killed Department Chair Phoivos Ziogas and [[professor]]s Matthew Douglass, Michael Hogben and Jaan Saber. He wounded Elizabeth Horwood, a departmental staff secretary.\n\nPhoivos Ziogas lived for a month in a coma before he died of massive internal injuries from the bullet ricocheting within his body.\n\n==Trial and psychiatric assessment==\nFabrikant represented himself at his five-month-long trial, after firing ten lawyers in the process. His claim was that the murders were done in \"self-defence\" because members of the faculty were \"trying to give [him] a heart attack\". During the trial, he compared himself to the abused orphans in the [[Mount Cashel Orphanage]].\n\nAfter several weeks of observing his [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric behaviour]], the judge suspended the proceedings to conduct a hearing into Fabrikant's mental fitness to stand trial. After a month's review, the two court-appointed psychiatrists found him fit to stand trial, although \"severely paranoid and hostile\".<ref>Michael D. Kelleher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JiQUkwBnzgYC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=Vlery+Fabrikant&source=bl&ots=PpxymBvGkG&sig=pWZ524xJMSqr1glkBqgT6UoTyUk&hl=en&ei=mrmSSqWyLZWwNuvA8BY&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Profiling the lethal employee: case studies of violence in the workplace''], p. 70, Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 1997, accessed 24 August 2009.</ref> The judge ended Fabrikant's performances in the courtroom and sent the case to the jury. With the essential facts not in doubt, they found Fabrikant guilty of [[first-degree murder]], and the court sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]].\n\nDespite two psychiatrists ruling in his favour, Fabrikant thought that he was insulted by them. According to Louis Morissette, Fabrikant asked to meet with him.<ref>Louis Morissette, M.D., FRCPC \u2013 Psychiatry doctor, responsible for the teen unit, Philippe-Pinel Institute of Montreal{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}.</ref> Morissette worked at the [[Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr\u00e9al]], an institution for the mentally disturbed, and specialized in legal psychiatry. Fabrikant spent several days there during his trial. Morissette spent several hours over a few days with Fabrikant. \"Fabrikant wanted my help to counter-argue the two psychiatrists' opinion on him in court, and to help him argue that psychology has no scientific basis and proves nothing.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Christainne Charette, \"Dr. Louis Morissette, interview\", ''SRC'', 14 November 2007 (quote translated from French by author).</ref>\n\nMorissette disagreed with the conclusions of the two psychiatrists appointed by the court. \"Mr. Fabrikant suffers, in my opinion, from more than a simple personality disorder, [\u2026] he could be treated by pharmaceutical products, a treatment he always refused.\" \"We often push the trial dates of people who suffer from complications because of heart attacks. In my opinion, Fabrikant is not fit to stand trial.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n* Concordia's Board of Governors had earlier adopted a policy banning firearms on the university campus. After the murders, the university joined the Coalition for Gun Control and gathered signatures for a petition calling for tougher national gun laws. In March 1994, Concordia representatives presented members of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] with a 200,000-signature petition to ban the private ownership of handguns in Canada.<ref name=\"The Fabrikant Affair\">\n[http://archives.concordia.ca/fabrikant \"The Fabrikant Affair\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606024241/http://archives.concordia.ca/fabrikant |date=2014-06-06 }}. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606024241/http://archives.concordia.ca/fabrikant |date=2014-06-06 }}, 24 August 1992, Concordia University Records Management and Archives, accessed 3 April 2012.\n</ref>\n* Concordia University commissioned two independent inquiries into events surrounding the murders. This followed a university review of scholarship guidelines. The university improved its administrative procedures and [[research ethics]] guidelines, as did Canada's research funding agencies. An investigation of faculty research in Fabrikant's department revealed that some of Fabrikant's claims about mismanagement of grants funds were factually correct. But, he did not challenge colleagues' work until he was well into his attacks against the university.\n* The Cowan report, which studied the interactions between university officials and Fabrikant from a personnel management perspective, found that \"The warnings and strictures placed upon him [Fabrikant] which directly related to his behaviour, (when they existed at all), were too mild, too vague, or (finally) too slow and ponderous.\"\n* The [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]] froze the research accounts of the three academics whom Fabrikant had accused of mismanaging funds. Two were temporarily suspended and one took an early retirement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} One was re-hired as a research professor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n* The university adopted new rules governing financial accountability and scientific integrity, improvements already in process at the time of the August 1992 events.

It set out standards of conduct for all members of the university. Further work was done on a new code of ethics, resulting in adoption in 1995 of a partial version of \"The Code of Ethics: Guidelines for Ethical Actions\". In 1997, the full version was adopted.<ref name=\"The Fabrikant Affair\"/>\n* The university created initiatives related to civil behaviour and conflict resolution, including the ''Peace and Conflict Resolution Series'' that began in 2003.<ref name=\"The Fabrikant Affair\"/>\n\nFabrikant is serving his sentence at [[Archambault Institution]] in [[Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nFabrikant is a [[usenet]] user known for posting in [[newsgroup]]s, particularly can.general and can.politics, as well as on his website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fabrikant.webs.com |title=V.

In addition, he had been conducting an email campaign against numerous members of the university. He claimed fears of being killed in jail.\n\nOn 24 August 1992, Fabrikant took concealed weapons and ammunition with him to the Engineering Department of the university, where he went on a shooting spree on the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building. He killed Department Chair Phoivos Ziogas and [[professor]]s Matthew Douglass, Michael Hogben and Jaan Saber. He wounded Elizabeth Horwood, a departmental staff secretary.\n\nPhoivos Ziogas lived for a month in a coma before he died of massive internal injuries from the bullet ricocheting within his body.\n\n==Trial and psychiatric assessment==\nFabrikant represented himself at his five-month-long trial, after firing ten lawyers in the process. His claim was that the murders were done in \"self-defence\" because members of the faculty were \"trying to give [him] a heart attack\". During the trial, he compared himself to the abused orphans in the [[Mount Cashel Orphanage]].\n\nAfter several weeks of observing his [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric behaviour]], the judge suspended the proceedings to conduct a hearing into Fabrikant's mental fitness to stand trial. After a month's review, the two court-appointed psychiatrists found him fit to stand trial, although \"severely paranoid and hostile\".<ref>Michael D. Kelleher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JiQUkwBnzgYC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=Vlery+Fabrikant&source=bl&ots=PpxymBvGkG&sig=pWZ524xJMSqr1glkBqgT6UoTyUk&hl=en&ei=mrmSSqWyLZWwNuvA8BY&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Profiling the lethal employee: case studies of violence in the workplace''], p. 70, Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 1997, accessed 24 August 2009.</ref> The judge ended Fabrikant's performances in the courtroom and sent the case to the jury. With the essential facts not in doubt, they found Fabrikant guilty of [[first-degree murder]], and the court sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]].\n\nDespite two psychiatrists ruling in his favour, Fabrikant thought that he was insulted by them. According to Louis Morissette, Fabrikant asked to meet with him.<ref>Louis Morissette, M.D., FRCPC \u2013 Psychiatry doctor, responsible for the teen unit, Philippe-Pinel Institute of Montreal{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}.</ref> Morissette worked at the [[Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr\u00e9al]], an institution for the mentally disturbed, and specialized in legal psychiatry. Fabrikant spent several days there during his trial. Morissette spent several hours over a few days with Fabrikant. \"Fabrikant wanted my help to counter-argue the two psychiatrists' opinion on him in court, and to help him argue that psychology has no scientific basis and proves nothing.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Christainne Charette, \"Dr. Louis Morissette, interview\", ''SRC'', 14 November 2007 (quote translated from French by author).</ref>\n\nMorissette disagreed with the conclusions of the two psychiatrists appointed by the court. \"Mr. Fabrikant suffers, in my opinion, from more than a simple personality disorder, [\u2026] he could be treated by pharmaceutical products, a treatment he always refused.\" \"We often push the trial dates of people who suffer from complications because of heart attacks. In my opinion, Fabrikant is not fit to stand trial.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n* Concordia's Board of Governors had earlier adopted a policy banning firearms on the university campus. After the murders, the university joined the Coalition for Gun Control and gathered signatures for a petition calling for tougher national gun laws. In March 1994, Concordia representatives presented members of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] with a 200,000-signature petition to ban the private ownership of handguns in Canada.<ref name=\"The Fabrikant Affair\">\n[http://archives.concordia.ca/fabrikant \"The Fabrikant Affair\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606024241/http://archives.concordia.ca/fabrikant |date=2014-06-06 }}. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606024241/http://archives.concordia.ca/fabrikant |date=2014-06-06 }}, 24 August 1992, Concordia University Records Management and Archives, accessed 3 April 2012.\n</ref>\n* Concordia University commissioned two independent inquiries into events surrounding the murders. This followed a university review of scholarship guidelines. The university improved its administrative procedures and [[research ethics]] guidelines, as did Canada's research funding agencies. An investigation of faculty research in Fabrikant's department revealed that some of Fabrikant's claims about mismanagement of grants funds were factually correct. But, he did not challenge colleagues' work until he was well into his attacks against the university.\n* The Cowan report, which studied the interactions between university officials and Fabrikant from a personnel management perspective, found that \"The warnings and strictures placed upon him [Fabrikant] which directly related to his behaviour, (when they existed at all), were too mild, too vague, or (finally) too slow and ponderous.\"\n* The [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]] froze the research accounts of the three academics whom Fabrikant had accused of mismanaging funds. Two were temporarily suspended and one took an early retirement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} One was re-hired as a research professor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n* The university adopted new rules governing financial accountability and scientific integrity, improvements already in process at the time of the August 1992 events.

It set out standards of conduct for all members of the university. Further work was done on a new code of ethics, resulting in adoption in 1995 of a partial version of \"The Code of Ethics: Guidelines for Ethical Actions\". In 1997, the full version was adopted.<ref name=\"The Fabrikant Affair\"/>\n* The university created initiatives related to civil behaviour and conflict resolution, including the ''Peace and Conflict Resolution Series'' that began in 2003.<ref name=\"The Fabrikant Affair\"/>\n\nFabrikant is serving his sentence at [[Archambault Institution]] in [[Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nFabrikant is a [[usenet]] user known for posting in [[newsgroup]]s, particularly can.general and can.politics, as well as on his website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fabrikant.webs.com |title=V.\u00a0I.
