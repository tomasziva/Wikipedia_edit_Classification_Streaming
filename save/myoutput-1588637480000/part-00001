Opposition to this proposal helped to galvanize the creation of national political organizations among Aboriginal peoples, bringing the concept of Indigenous self-government to the national political consciousness for the first time.<ref name=Wherrett-B/>\n\nThe constitutional amendments of 1982 included [[Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act'' which recognized [[Aboriginal rights]] and [[treaty rights]] but did not define these.<ref name=Hurley/> In 1983, the [[Special Committee]] of the House of Commons on Indian Self-Government, released its report (also called the Penner Report after committee chair [[Keith Penner]]).  It recommended that the federal government recognize First Nations as a distinct order of government within the Canadian federation and begin to negotiate self-government agreements with Indian bands.<ref name=Wherrett-B/>\n\nAn attempt was made by Indigenous leaders to have the concept of Indigenous self-government enshrined via the [[Meech Lake Accord|1987 Meech Lake package of constitutional amendments]], but they failed to convince the [[first ministers]] to include such provisions<ref name=Hurley/>  This led to Aboriginal hostility to the agreement and saw Manitoban MLA [[Elija Harper]], a Registered Cree Indian, help to defeat the accord.  The follow-up [[Charlottetown Accord]] (1992) included recognition of an inherent Aboriginal right of self-government, but this package also failed<ref name=Hurley/> though not because of Aboriginal resistance: in fact self-government was unpopular with many non-Aboriginal voters and may have been a factor in its defeat in the national referendum which followed.\n\nThe [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] issued its final report in 1996, which recommended that Indigenous governments become recognized as the third order of government in Canada (alongside the federal government and the provinces) and that Indigenous peoples receive special representation in Parliament.<ref name=Hurley/>\n\nAfter this time, however, the emphasis shifted away from constitutional entrenchment towards negotiations with individual communities.  The Conservative government announced its ''Community-Based Self-Government'' (SBSG) policy in 1986, to \"enable negotiation of new Crown - Aboriginal relationships outside of the Indian Act\" on a community-by-community basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1325102789963/1325102827484 |title=ARCHIVED - Evaluation of the Federal Government's Implementation of Self-Government and Self-Government Agreements |website=Aadnc-aandc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 the Liberal government issued the '''Inherent Right of Self-Government Policy'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atns.net.au/agreement.asp?EntityID=2277 |title=Agreements, Treaties and Negotiated Settlements project |publisher=ATNS |date= |accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> which recognized that self-government was an inherent right, but limited its implementation to a model which resembles delegation of authority from the Crown to the communities.

A new federal territory, [[Nunavut]] was created in 1999 where the Inuit were the majority, separate from the [[North West Territories]] where more First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and non-Aboriginal people lived.

Instead they are represented by the [[Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee)]] or GCCEI and governed by the closely linked [[Cree Regional Authority]].  The GCCEI signed an agreement in 2012 with the province of Quebec that would abolish the municipalities in the region and merge them with the Cree Regional Authority in a new regional government called the [[Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory]].  {{As of|2014}} the GCCEI are in talks with the federal government on a [[Cree Nation Governance Agreement]] to refine the new structure's relationship to the federal authorities.<ref name=\"aadnc-aandc1\"/>\n\nThe [https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1502376429223/1542741448397 Anishinabek Education Agreement] is another self-governance model.

These were ignored or suppressed by the [[Government of Canada]] (federal government).<ref>Wherrett, Section A</ref> For the M\u00e9tis and Inuit, self-government was replaced by integration into the Canadian polity: these people could vote in the standard municipal, provincial, and federal elections as citizens of Canada. For the First Nations, the Government of Canada created the [[First Nations government (Canada)|band system]] under the ''[[Indian Act]]'', which allowed First Nations people to vote in band elections but they could not vote in federal elections before 1960 unless they renounced their status as [[Registered Indians]] (a process referred to as [[enfranchisement (Canada)|enfranchisement]]).
