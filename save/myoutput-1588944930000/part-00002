For example, [[manual transmission]]s became less common as technology relating to [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] and [[automatic transmission]]s advanced.\n\nEarlier versions of headlights and signal lights were fueled by [[acetylene]] or oil. Acetylene was preferred to oil, because its flame is resistant to both wind and rain. Acetylene headlights, which gave a strong green-tinted light, were popular until after World War I; even though the first electric headlights were introduced in 1898 (and those were battery-powered), it wasn't until high-wattage bulbs and more powerful car electrical generating systems were developed in the late 1910s that electric lighting systems entirely superseded acetylene.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Steering==\n[[File:1904-oldsmobile-archives.jpg|thumb|1904 [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash]] with a tiller steering]]\nThe first automobiles were steered with a [[tiller]] sometimes on the left or right, sometimes in the centre.

There is usually also a [[parking brake]] which operates the rear brakes only. On manual cars this is a lever between the front seats, but can be a pedal on some automatic transmission vehicles. In [[rallying]] the handbrake lever is long and vertical, extending to near the steering wheel, to facilitate [[handbrake turn]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=WRC Braking technology |url=http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/wrc_braking_tech.html |accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Throttle control==\nThe [[throttle]], which controls fuel and air supply to the engine and is also known as the \"accelerator\" or \"gas pedal\", is normally the right-most floor pedal.

This does not usually apply to [[electric vehicle]]s because their [[electric motor|motors]] can drive the vehicle both forward and backward from zero speed. In some [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles there is a gear lever that engages a low-ratio gearbox. Other levers may switch between two- and four-wheel drive and [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] locks.\n\nSome cars have a [[freewheel]] that disengages the [[driveshaft]] from the driven shaft. This happens when the driven shaft rotates faster than the driveshaft. For example, Saab used a freewheel system in their earlier vehicles, to let the engine disconnect from the transmission while coasting. (This was NOT for fuel economy as a previous editor wrote.) This was a feature added because of the limited lubrication in the two-stroke engine. A petroil-lubricated two-stroke requires lubrication according to its speed, but provides this lubrication according to the amount of its throttle opening. Where the engine operates at high RPM and low throttle (such as when coasting down a long hill), the lubrication provided may be inadequate. With the freewheel, a coasting engine could reduce its speed to idling, thus requiring only the small lubrication available from the closed, coasting, throttle. Freewheeling can also be used to help reduce high exhaust gas temperatures in two stroke models caused by prolonged use of the throttle at higher RPM. <ref name=freewheel>\n{{Citation\n | last = Markovitch\n | first = Alex\n | title = Small Sporty Sedans\n | publisher = Hearst Magazines\n | newspaper = Popular Mechanics\n | volume = 131\n | number = 1\n | date = January 1969\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HNgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA208&dq=saab+freewheeling&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-tsHr1s_RAhVK5CYKHS40CsoQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=saab%20freewheeling&f=false\n | issn = 0032-4558\n | pages = \n | access-date = }}</ref>\n\nFreewheeling was retained in the four-stroke variant, until the end of production and in the [[Saab 99]] with the 1709 cc Triumph engine. A minor drawback to the freewheel, particularly for drivers unfamiliar with the Saab, is that it makes [[engine braking]] unavailable although it could be manually engaged or disengaged by a control in the foot-well. Fixed wheel engagement, using the foot, could be difficult, as it involved pulling a 'T handle' intended for manual operation.<ref name=freewheel/> Some cars, such as the [[Rover P4]], include a manual switch to engage or disengage the freewheel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rover P4 Manual|url=http://www.rover.org.nz/manuals/p4/controls.htm|accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Manual===\nManual transmission is also known as a manual gearbox, stick shift, standard, and stick. Most automobile manual transmissions have several [[gear ratio]]s that are chosen by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Manual transmissions feature a driver-operated [[clutch]] pedal and [[gear stick]]. Historically, cars had a manual [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] switch.\n\n===Automatic===\nThe desire for driver convenience led to the widespread implementation of the semi-automatic transmission, automatic transmission and [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT). Some automatic transmission vehicles have extra controls that modify the choices made by the transmission system. These controls depend on the engine and road speed. Automatic transmissions generally have a straight pattern, beginning at the most forward position with park, and running through reverse, neutral, drive, and then to the lower gears.\n\n==Signals and lighting==\nCars have controls for [[headlamps]], fog lamps, turn signals, and other [[automotive lighting]]. Turn signals are activated by the driver to alert other drivers of their intent to turn or change lanes.<ref name=\"FMVSS108RW\">[https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2007/12/04/07-5644/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-lamps-reflective-devices-and-associated-equipment Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment: Final Rule 12/04/2007]</ref> While the modern turn signal was patented in 1938,<ref>{{US patent|2122508}}</ref> electric turn-signal lights date back to 1907.<ref>{{US patent|912831}}</ref>\n\n{{As of | 2013|post=,}} most countries require turn signals to be included on all vehicles driven on public roadways. The turn signal lever is usually activated by a horizontal lever protruding from the steering column.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n[[File:VW polo berline dashboard (372208491).jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Polo]] dashboard with, left to right, controls for lighting and the horn, gauges for engine temperature, vehicle and engine speed, fuel level, and the windshield wiper control.]]\nVehicles are generally equipped with a variety of [[Vehicle instrument|instruments]] mounted on the [[dashboard]] to indicate driving parameters and the state of the mechanics. The placement of the instruments can vary. While they are usually mounted behind the steering wheel, they may also be mounted centrally below the [[windshield]], or integrated into the [[Center console (automobile)|center stack]] above the [[climate control]] and [[In-vehicle infotainment|audio system]]. The standard [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]] found on road vehicles include the following:\n\n*[[Speedometer]] \n*[[Tachometer]]\n*[[Odometer]] \n*[[Fuel gauge]] \n*[[Engine coolant temperature sensor|Engine temperature gauge]]\n*[[Ammeter]] \n*[[Oil pressure]] gauge\n\nThese gauges are supplemented by an assortment of [[Tell-tale (automotive)|warning lights]] that indicate the currently selected [[Automatic transmission#Automatic transmission modes|transmission gear mode]], the generic [[check engine light]], and the current status of various vehicle systems.\n\nThe layout and design of these instruments have evolved over the years by being implemented as [[Electronic instrument cluster|digital readouts]] rather than the traditional analog dial-type indicators. Depending on the type of vehicle, more specialized instruments may be used such as a [[trip computer]], [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] gauge, or [[battery level]] display.\n\n==Starting and running the engine==\n[[File:1917Packard2-25ConvertableCoupeCrankholder.jpg|thumb|1917 [[Packard]] crank holder]]\nBefore the appearance of the starter motor, engines were started by various difficult and dangerous methods. These methods included: wind-up springs, [[Coffman engine starter|gunpowder cylinders]], and human-powered techniques such as a removable [[hand-crank]]. In 1896, the first electric starter was installed on an [[Arnold (automobile)|Arnold]],<ref>[[G.N. Georgano]] (1985). ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''.

This type of control has now returned with the use of [[keyless entry]]. Early Chevrolet cars had the starter pedal to the right of the accelerator, with a secondary throttle control knob on the dashboard because it was difficult to operate the starter pedal and pump the gas pedal at the same time.\n\nSome other historical engine controls, which are automated in modern passenger cars, were the [[choke valve]], [[ignition timing]], and [[spark arrestor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chevy.oldcarmanualproject.com/chevyowner/28cim13.htm|title=1928 Chevy Owner's Manual|accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Additional controls ==\nIn the past, all cars had manual controls for starting and running the engine. Now, modern cars not only have automated controls, but they also have controls that are not directly used to drive the vehicle. These controls include [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]], [[Automotive navigation system|navigation systems]], [[Carputer|on-board computers]], [[in-car entertainment]], [[windscreen wiper]], and [[touchscreen]] panels.\n\nThese controls vary in scope and design between different types of cars. They may also be located and operated differently in other road vehicles such as [[motorcycle]]s, where the throttle is controlled by a hand lever and the gear shift is operated by a pedal. Some types of vehicle controls are found in [[rail vehicle]]s. For example, some [[tram]]s and [[light rail vehicle]]s like the [[PCC streetcar]] use automobile-style pedals to control the speed.\n\nIn [[Formula One]] auto racing, many vehicle parameters can be set by the driver during a race. Controls for these are mounted on the steering wheel, and can include controls for: brake balance, [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], ignition timing, [[regenerative brake]], [[rev limiter]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Colson|first1=Jordan|title=An Inside Look at the Insanely Complex Formula 1 Steering Wheel|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/formula-1-steering-wheels/|website=Wired|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the automobile]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Auto parts|Pedal]]\n[[Category:Vehicle parts]]\n[[Category:Automotive technologies]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|car parts used to control the vehicle}}\n[[File:1923 Ford Model T UPS interior.jpg|thumb|300px|In the [[Ford Model T]], the standing pedals control the two forward gears (left pedal), reverse (center pedal), and the brake (right pedal).

Depending on the type of vehicle, more specialized instruments may be used such as a [[trip computer]], [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] gauge, or [[battery level]] display.\n\n==Starting and running the engine==\n[[File:1917Packard2-25ConvertableCoupeCrankholder.jpg|thumb|1917 [[Packard]] crank holder]]\nBefore the appearance of the starter motor, engines were started by various difficult and dangerous methods. These methods included: wind-up springs, [[Coffman engine starter|gunpowder cylinders]], and human-powered techniques such as a removable [[hand-crank]]. In 1896, the first electric starter was installed on an [[Arnold (automobile)|Arnold]],<ref>[[G.N. Georgano]] (1985). ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''.

Leland|Henry Leland]] later invented and filed {{US patent|1150523}} for the first electric starter in America in 1911. In 1912, the [[Cadillac Model Thirty]] became the first American car to have a starter installed.\n\nBefore [[Chrysler]]'s 1949 innovation of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA122&lpg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=\"Chrysler Family Debut\", '&#39;Popular Mechanics'&#39; April 1949, p.122 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}</ref> the starter was operated by the driver pressing a button that was mounted on the floor or dashboard. This type of control has now returned with the use of [[keyless entry]]. Early Chevrolet cars had the starter pedal to the right of the accelerator, with a secondary throttle control knob on the dashboard because it was difficult to operate the starter pedal and pump the gas pedal at the same time.\n\nSome other historical engine controls, which are automated in modern passenger cars, were the [[choke valve]], [[ignition timing]], and [[spark arrestor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chevy.oldcarmanualproject.com/chevyowner/28cim13.htm|title=1928 Chevy Owner's Manual|accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Additional controls ==\nIn the past, all cars had manual controls for starting and running the engine. Now, modern cars not only have automated controls, but they also have controls that are not directly used to drive the vehicle. These controls include [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]], [[Automotive navigation system|navigation systems]], [[Carputer|on-board computers]], [[in-car entertainment]], [[windscreen wiper]], and [[touchscreen]] panels.\n\nThese controls vary in scope and design between different types of cars. They may also be located and operated differently in other road vehicles such as [[motorcycle]]s, where the throttle is controlled by a hand lever and the gear shift is operated by a pedal. Some types of vehicle controls are found in [[rail vehicle]]s. For example, some [[tram]]s and [[light rail vehicle]]s like the [[PCC streetcar]] use automobile-style pedals to control the speed.\n\nIn [[Formula One]] auto racing, many vehicle parameters can be set by the driver during a race. Controls for these are mounted on the steering wheel, and can include controls for: brake balance, [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], ignition timing, [[regenerative brake]], [[rev limiter]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Colson|first1=Jordan|title=An Inside Look at the Insanely Complex Formula 1 Steering Wheel|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/formula-1-steering-wheels/|website=Wired|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the automobile]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Auto parts|Pedal]]\n[[Category:Vehicle parts]]\n[[Category:Automotive technologies]]\n", "name_user": "Cornellier", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInstrumentation:rm not \"generally equipped\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_controls"}
