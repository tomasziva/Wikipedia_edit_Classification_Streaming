Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|awakening]] and [[nirvana]].{{refn|group=note|For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation \"includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim.\" Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: \"To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]....\" A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: \"'''Meditation'''&nbsp;\u2013 general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'\" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are \"of a more preparatory nature\" (p. 4).}} The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bh\u0101van\u0101]]'',{{refn|group=note|The [[P\u0101li]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bh\u0101van\u0101'' literally means \"development\" as in \"mental development.\" For the association of this term with \"meditation,\" see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in \"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nassati\u1e43, r\u0101hula, bh\u0101vana\u1e43 bh\u0101vehi.}}'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: \"Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bh\u0101vana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&-out breathing]].\" (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)}} ''jh\u0101na''/''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]'',{{refn|group=note|See, for example, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word \"zen\" from [[Sanskrit]] \"dhy\u0101na\". [[P\u0101li Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] ''dhy\u0101na'' / [Pali:] ''jh\u0101na'') or \"concentrations\" (''[[sam\u0101dhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)}} and ''[[vipassana]]''.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&nbsp;\u2013 across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Therav\u0101da]] tradition, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.{{refn|group=note|Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&nbsp;\u2013 and by whatever name&nbsp;\u2013 are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s\" (p. 227).}} Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.{{refn|group=note|Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, [[Nyanaponika]] (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).}}\n\nAccording to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial traditions, and the Tibetan tradition,<ref name=\"Ray2004\">Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']</ref> the Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).<ref>These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269\u201370, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].</ref>\n\nThrough the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]]) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions.<ref name=\"Ray2004\"/> In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.<ref>See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267\u201368, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].

Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]] from around the 5th century, and influenced [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Chinese martial arts]].\n\nLivia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Taoist meditation: \"concentrative\", \"insight\", and \"visualization\".<ref>Kohn, Livia (2008), \"Meditation and visualization,\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'', ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118.</ref> ''Ding'' [[wikt:\u5b9a|\u5b9a]] (literally means \"decide; settle; stabilize\") refers to \"deep concentration\", \"intent contemplation\", or \"perfect absorption\". ''Guan'' [[wikt:\u89c0|\u89c0]] (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) Taoist masters based upon the ''[[Tiantai]]'' Buddhist practice of ''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. ''Cun'' [[wikt:\u5b58|\u5b58]] (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School]]s.

The word derives from the Hebrew word \"boded\" (\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3), meaning the state of being alone.<ref>Kaplan, A.

Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Modern spirituality===\n[[File:Jawlensky Meditation 1290065.jpg|thumb|upright|''Meditation''.

Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|awakening]] and [[nirvana]].{{refn|group=note|For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation \"includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim.\" Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: \"To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]....\" A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: \"'''Meditation'''&nbsp;\u2013 general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'\" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are \"of a more preparatory nature\" (p. 4).}} The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bh\u0101van\u0101]]'',{{refn|group=note|The [[P\u0101li]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bh\u0101van\u0101'' literally means \"development\" as in \"mental development.\" For the association of this term with \"meditation,\" see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in \"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nassati\u1e43, r\u0101hula, bh\u0101vana\u1e43 bh\u0101vehi.}}'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: \"Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bh\u0101vana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&-out breathing]].\" (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)}} ''jh\u0101na''/''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]'',{{refn|group=note|See, for example, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word \"zen\" from [[Sanskrit]] \"dhy\u0101na\". [[P\u0101li Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] ''dhy\u0101na'' / [Pali:] ''jh\u0101na'') or \"concentrations\" (''[[sam\u0101dhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)}} and ''[[vipassana]]''.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&nbsp;\u2013 across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Therav\u0101da]] tradition, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.{{refn|group=note|Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&nbsp;\u2013 and by whatever name&nbsp;\u2013 are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s\" (p. 227).}} Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.{{refn|group=note|Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, [[Nyanaponika]] (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).}}\n\nAccording to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial traditions, and the Tibetan tradition,<ref name=\"Ray2004\">Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']</ref> the Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).<ref>These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269\u201370, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].</ref>\n\nThrough the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]]) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions.<ref name=\"Ray2004\"/> In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.<ref>See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267\u201368, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].

Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]] from around the 5th century, and influenced [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Chinese martial arts]].\n\nLivia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Taoist meditation: \"concentrative\", \"insight\", and \"visualization\".<ref>Kohn, Livia (2008), \"Meditation and visualization,\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'', ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118.</ref> ''Ding'' [[wikt:\u5b9a|\u5b9a]] (literally means \"decide; settle; stabilize\") refers to \"deep concentration\", \"intent contemplation\", or \"perfect absorption\". ''Guan'' [[wikt:\u89c0|\u89c0]] (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) Taoist masters based upon the ''[[Tiantai]]'' Buddhist practice of ''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. ''Cun'' [[wikt:\u5b58|\u5b58]] (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School]]s.

The word derives from the Hebrew word \"boded\" (\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3), meaning the state of being alone.<ref>Kaplan, A.

Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Modern spirituality===\n[[File:Jawlensky Meditation 1290065.jpg|thumb|upright|''Meditation''.
