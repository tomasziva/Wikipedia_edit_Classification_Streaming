cancellation, and previous network president [[Paul Lee (television executive)|Paul Lee]] had stated that \"''Nashville'' has a lot more story to tell\" during the TCA winter press tour.<ref>{{cite

As the negotiations began to draw to a close, it was rumored that the announcement would be made during the high-profile [[CMT Music Awards]].  When no announcement was made, fans began to doubt the show's return. On June 10, 2016, CMT released a press statement stating that a deal had been made with CMT and [[Hulu]].
