Albanian [[organized crime]] is active in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and various other parts of the world including the Middle East and Asia. The Albanian Mafia participates in a diverse range of criminal enterprises including trafficking in drugs, arms, humans, and human organs. The Albanian criminal scenario is characterized by diversified criminal plans which, in their complexity, show one of the highest criminal capacities in the world. In Albania alone, there are over 15 mafia families that control organized crime. According to [[WikiLeaks]] reports, the Albanians are led by \u2018Viggo Terosova\u2019 .<ref name=\":0\" />         The Albanian mafia has monopolized various international affiliations from as far east as [[Israel]], to as far west as [[South America]]. These reports primarily indicate a strong connection between politicians and various Albanian mafia families. According to the [[Research Institute for European and American Studies]] (RIEAS), Albanian mafia groups are hybrid organizations (various sectors of society), often involved in both criminal and political activities.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/tip-iceberg-french-police-arrest-albanian-heroin-traffickers-balkan-criminal-gangs-tighten-grip|title=Tip Of The Iceberg: French Police Arrest Albanian Heroin Traffickers, But Balkan Criminal Gangs Tighten Grip Across Europe|date=16 October 2012|work=International Business Times|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Albanian mafia, in its entirety, constitutes one of the highest crime generating elements in the world, combining the \"traditional\" characteristics \u2013 plainly manifest in the rigid internal discipline, in the clan structure, in the \"endogamic closure\" which increases the impermeability, the reliability and the endogenous solidity \u2013 with modern and innovative elements, such as trans-nationality, commercial imprinting and the criminogenous culture of service. The massive logistics to almost anywhere and the syncretic nature of Albanian crime has facilitated its establishment outside the mother country and its integration with the local criminality, exploiting the opportunities inherent in the entire compatriot network.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the term \"Albanian Mafia\" may include or refer specifically to various [[Albanian-American]] organized crime groups, such as the [[Rudaj Organization]] or [[Albanian Boys]], both based in [[New York City]]. Albanian-American crime groups vary in the extent of their connections to Albanian mafia groups in Albania or Europe, ranging from loosely connected to or mostly independent of Albanian mafias in Europe to being essentially American extensions of European Albanian mafia groups.\n\n==Structure and composition==\n\n===Clan hierarchy===\nThe typical structure of the Albanian mafia is hierarchical. A family clan is referred to as a \"fis\" or a \"fare.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/03/1571454/introduction-new-york-albanian-mob?page=all|title=An introduction to the New York-Albanian mob - Capital New York|publisher=Capitalnewyork.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> Families contain an executive committee known as a \"Bajrak\" and select a high-ranking member for each unit. A unit is led by a \"Krye\" or \"Boss\" who selects \"Kryetar\" or \"Underbosses\" to serve under them.

Albanian mafia families or clans are usually made up of groups that have thousands of members all over the world, constituting an extended family, residing all along the Balkan route from Eastern Turkey, to Western Europe, and North America.\n\nAccording to Ioannis Michaletos, the family structure is characterized by a strong inner discipline, which is achieved by means of punitive action for every deviation from internal rules. Punishment ensures fear, and fear guarantees unconditional loyalty to the family. Provisions within the family structure allow official laws to be considered secondary, unimportant, and non-binding. Since mafia families are based on blood relations, the number of clan members are limited, and bonds between them tend to be very strong. As a result, infiltrating into the mafia is almost impossible. Members of other ethnic groups can be accepted only to execute one time or secondary jobs. The Albanian mafia families are organized in 4\u20136 or more levels; such a structure enables them to preserve the organizational action capability even in case some of its members or groups are captured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rieas.gr/index.php?Itemid=42&id=332&option=com_content&task=view |title=Shape Of The Albanian Organized Crime |publisher=Rieas.gr |date=2000-04-13 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Clans by region in Albania===\nThe Albanian mafia has clans throughout the world.

In fact, some organizations which reached Italy in the early 1990s, infiltrated the Lombardy narco-traffic network run by the 'ndrangheta. Albanian mafia leaders have reached stable agreements with the Italian criminal organizations, also with the mafia, so have gained legitimacy in many illegal circuits, diversifying their activities to avoid reasons of conflict with similar host structures.

Today, both Sicilian mafia groups and the '[[Ndrangheta]] are believed to have franchised out prostitution, gambling, and drug dealing in territories along the Adriatic coast to the Albanians.

Albanian [[organized crime]] is active in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and various other parts of the world including the Middle East and Asia. The Albanian Mafia participates in a diverse range of criminal enterprises including trafficking in drugs, arms, humans, and human organs. The Albanian criminal scenario is characterized by diversified criminal plans which, in their complexity, show one of the highest criminal capacities in the world. In Albania alone, there are over 15 mafia families that control organized crime. According to [[WikiLeaks]] reports, the Albanians are led by \u2018Viggo Terosova\u2019 .<ref name=\":0\" />         The Albanian mafia has monopolized various international affiliations from as far east as [[Israel]], to as far west as [[South America]]. These reports primarily indicate a strong connection between politicians and various Albanian mafia families. According to the [[Research Institute for European and American Studies]] (RIEAS), Albanian mafia groups are hybrid organizations (various sectors of society), often involved in both criminal and political activities.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/tip-iceberg-french-police-arrest-albanian-heroin-traffickers-balkan-criminal-gangs-tighten-grip|title=Tip Of The Iceberg: French Police Arrest Albanian Heroin Traffickers, But Balkan Criminal Gangs Tighten Grip Across Europe|date=16 October 2012|work=International Business Times|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Albanian mafia, in its entirety, constitutes one of the highest crime generating elements in the world, combining the \"traditional\" characteristics \u2013 plainly manifest in the rigid internal discipline, in the clan structure, in the \"endogamic closure\" which increases the impermeability, the reliability and the endogenous solidity \u2013 with modern and innovative elements, such as trans-nationality, commercial imprinting and the criminogenous culture of service. The massive logistics to almost anywhere and the syncretic nature of Albanian crime has facilitated its establishment outside the mother country and its integration with the local criminality, exploiting the opportunities inherent in the entire compatriot network.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the term \"Albanian Mafia\" may include or refer specifically to various [[Albanian-American]] organized crime groups, such as the [[Rudaj Organization]] or [[Albanian Boys]], both based in [[New York City]]. Albanian-American crime groups vary in the extent of their connections to Albanian mafia groups in Albania or Europe, ranging from loosely connected to or mostly independent of Albanian mafias in Europe to being essentially American extensions of European Albanian mafia groups.\n\n==Structure and composition==\n\n===Clan hierarchy===\nThe typical structure of the Albanian mafia is hierarchical. A family clan is referred to as a \"fis\" or a \"fare.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/03/1571454/introduction-new-york-albanian-mob?page=all|title=An introduction to the New York-Albanian mob - Capital New York|publisher=Capitalnewyork.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> Families contain an executive committee known as a \"Bajrak\" and select a high-ranking member for each unit. A unit is led by a \"Krye\" or \"Boss\" who selects \"Kryetar\" or \"Underbosses\" to serve under them.

Albanian mafia families or clans are usually made up of groups that have thousands of members all over the world, constituting an extended family, residing all along the Balkan route from Eastern Turkey, to Western Europe, and North America.\n\nAccording to Ioannis Michaletos, the family structure is characterized by a strong inner discipline, which is achieved by means of punitive action for every deviation from internal rules. Punishment ensures fear, and fear guarantees unconditional loyalty to the family. Provisions within the family structure allow official laws to be considered secondary, unimportant, and non-binding. Since mafia families are based on blood relations, the number of clan members are limited, and bonds between them tend to be very strong. As a result, infiltrating into the mafia is almost impossible. Members of other ethnic groups can be accepted only to execute one time or secondary jobs. The Albanian mafia families are organized in 4\u20136 or more levels; such a structure enables them to preserve the organizational action capability even in case some of its members or groups are captured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rieas.gr/index.php?Itemid=42&id=332&option=com_content&task=view |title=Shape Of The Albanian Organized Crime |publisher=Rieas.gr |date=2000-04-13 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Clans by region in Albania===\nThe Albanian mafia has clans throughout the world.

In fact, some organizations which reached Italy in the early 1990s, infiltrated the Lombardy narco-traffic network run by the 'ndrangheta. Albanian mafia leaders have reached stable agreements with the Italian criminal organizations, also with the mafia, so have gained legitimacy in many illegal circuits, diversifying their activities to avoid reasons of conflict with similar host structures.
