On 14 February 1917 the 2/6th King's landed at [[Boulogne]].

Between 21 January and 14 March 1944 the ''Luftwaffe'' carried out 11 conventional night raids on London in the so-called '[[Baby Blitz]]'.

AA Command also had the task of protecting the Overlord assembly areas and ports: in May and June 1944, while the build-up for Overlord was at its height, 38th S/L Rgt was transferred to the command of [[38th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|38th AA Bde]] in 2 AA Group (covering the [[Thames Estuary]]), but returned a month later.<ref name = Frederick859/><ref name = Rout408/><ref>Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85.</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the V-1 campaign against London came on 13 June, a week after Overlord was launched on [[D Day]], and Operation Diver was put into effect. The S/L positions had been established at {{convert|3000|yd|m}} intervals to cooperate with RAF night-fighters, and each position also had a [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] light AA gun. After a poor start the guns and fighters began to gain a measure of control over the flying bombs, and by the end of the first phase of the operation, after 21st Army Group had overrun the launch sites in Northern France in September, 1800 night fighter interceptions had been achieved, of which 142 were due to S/L illumination.
