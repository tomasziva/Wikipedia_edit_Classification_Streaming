The foundation can be dated thanks to fitz-Brian's foundation charter, which was witnessed by Ralph, Archdeacon of Stafford who ceased to hold office in 1175. The priory was also dedicated to [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Beckett]], who was not canonized until 1173.<ref name=\"UK History\"/>\n\nFitz-Brain's original grant to the priory included 70 acres of land around the [[River Sow]] and use of property in Stafford, subject to an annual rent of 8 shillings. At some point the [[patronage]] of the priory was transferred to [[Richard Peche]], [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]]. Peche resigned his [[episcopal see]] in 1182 and joined the brothers at the priory, being buried there the following year. Successive Bishops of Lichfield and Coventry would remain patrons of the house.<ref name=\"UK History\"/>\n\nThroughout the 12th century, the priory accepted numerous gifts of land from the bishops and other local gentry and landowners. Bishop Peche gifts the house land in [[Lichfield]], [[Cannock]] and [[Baswich]], as well as the rights to fish on the rivers Sow and [[river Penk|Penk]]. From the local landowners, such as the de Mutton family of [[Ingestre Hall]], they received land grants in [[Tixall]], [[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]] and [[Donisthorpe]].
