The four people who received the fewest votes, Chris, Minh-Ly, Nico, and Susanne, would compete in two competitions. The winners of each competition would be saved, leaving the other two nominated for eviction. Minh-Ly won the first competition and Chris won the second, leaving Nico and Susanne nominated for the first eviction.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: On Day 5, Nico walked from the game, thus cancelling the live eviction vote set for Day 6.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During Week 3, The Power of Veto Competition was played in pairs. The original player picked had to choose a player to play with them during the competition. If that pair won, then the original player picked would win the Power of Veto and their teammate would receive safety for the week. Madeline won the Power of Veto, and her partner, John Luke, earned immunity for the rest of the week.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: On Day 17, Jamar was expelled from the game after allegedly exhibiting \u201cthreatening\u201d behaviour toward Kyle.<ref name=\"jamar expulsion\"/> On Day 19, Kyle was expelled from the game for problematic behaviour.<ref name=\"kyle expulsion 2\"/> As a result of both expulsions, no eviction vote was held for Week 3. The game reset for Week 4, allowing Sheldon (as outgoing Head of Household) to compete in Week 4's Head of Household competition, which he ultimately won.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: The HouseGuests were told that the winner of Week 4's Head of Household competition would win a special power. Sheldon won the competition and was secretly awarded the Wendy's Power Up Necklace - which awarded the holder the ability \u201cSpice up the Veto\u201d (allowing the HoH to play in the PoV) or to \u201cChop A Vote\u201d (voiding an eviction vote from a HouseGuest at the next eviction). Sheldon chose to \u201cChop A Vote\u201d.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: On Day 25, ''Big Brother Canada'' announced an early end to production on the season due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada|COVID-19 pandemic]]. ''Big Brother Canada 8'' ended with no winner.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Viewing figures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:auto; margin: auto;\"\n|-\n! {{abbr|No.|Episode Number}}\n!
