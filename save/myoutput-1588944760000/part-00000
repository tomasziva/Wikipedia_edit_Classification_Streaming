The dark-brown region is Indian-administered Kashmir, while the [[Aksai Chin]] was annexed by China.|alt=]]\n[[File:Maheshwari Flag.png|alt=|thumb|Civil flag of  [[Azad Kashmir|Kashmir]].]]\nThe '''history of Pak occupied Kashmir''', a part of the [[Kashmir]] region occupied by [[Pakistan]], is related to the history of the Kashmir region during the Raja Hari singh rule. Kashmir borders the Pakistani occupied provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] to the south and west respectively, [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] to the north, and the  [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] to the east.\n\n== Modern history ==\n{{main|Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)}}\nThe princely state of [[Jammu]] and Kashmir came into being in 1846 after the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]]. Prior to that, [[Jammu region|Jammu]] was a tributary of the [[Sikh empire]] based in [[Lahore]].  [[Gulab Singh]], formerly a footman in the [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army who distinguished himself in various campaigns, was appointed as the Raja of Jammu in 1822. The Valley of Kashmir was also a part of the Sikh empire, ruled through a separate governor. Raja Gulab Singh successively fought and captured [[Rajouri district|Rajouri]] (1821), [[Kishtwar district|Kishtwar]] (1821), and through his general [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria|Zorawar Singh]], Suru valley and [[Kargil district|Kargil]] (1835), [[Ladakh]] (1834\u20131840), and [[Baltistan]] (1840). He became a wealthy and influential noble in the Sikh court.{{sfn|Schofield|2003|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nDuring the First Anglo-Sikh war in 1845\u20131846, Gulab Singh sided with the British, leading to a Sikh defeat. In the ensuing [[Treaty of Lahore]], the Sikhs were made to cede [[Kashmir valley|Kashmir]] and [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] to the British, in lieu of their indemnity, and to recognize Gulab Singh as an independent Mahraja. A week later, in the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]], Gulab Singh paid the British the indemnity that was due from the Sikhs, and acquired Kashmir in return.{{sfn|Schofield|2003|pp=6\u20137}} Thus Gulab Singh became the Maharaja of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, founding a new [[Dogra Dynasty]]. The Treaty of Amritsar continues to be widely regarded by the Kashmiris as a \"sale deed\".\n\nIn 1856, Gulab Singh abdicated in favour of his son [[Ranbir Singh (Maharaja)|Ranbir Singh]], who became the Maharaja. During the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, Ranbir Singh again came to the aid of the British and was duly rewarded. During Ranbir Singh's rule, Kashmir faced oppressive despotism, as recognized by British observers. In 1860, Ranbir Singh annexed [[Gilgit]]. [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] became tributaries soon afterwards.{{sfn|Schofield|2003|pp=9\u201311}} Ranbir Singh was succeeded by [[Pratap Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Pratap Singh]] (1885\u20131925) and [[Hari Singh]] (1925\u20131952), the latter being the ruler at the time of Indian independence.\n\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 was extremely diverse. The Valley of Kashmir, the most populous region, was a historically powerful kingdom, having stood up to the [[Arab incursions into the Indian subcontinent|Arabs]] and the Afghan-Turk invaders, and remaining independent until the time of [[Akbar]]. It was 97% Muslim, with 3% religious minorities, mostly the Hindu community of [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s. The Jammu division's eastern districts had a Hindu majority population culturally aligned to the Hill states of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Its western districts like [[History of Poonch District|Poonch]], [[Kotli]] and [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]] had a Muslim majority culturally aligned to the [[West Punjab]] plains. [[Ladakh]], a large mountainous region, had a mostly Buddhist population culturally aligned to Tibet. The northern areas of [[Gilgit]] and [[Baltistan]] were almost entirely Muslim, with Buddhist minorities, culturally aligned to Pakhtun and Central Asian regions.\n\nPoonch was a [[jagir]] bestowed by the Maharaja Ranjit Singh to Gulab Singh's brother Raja Dhian Singh. Upon the latter's death, the jagir was reclaimed by Lahore and it was passed to Gulab Singh in the treaties of Lahore and Amritsar. However, Dhian Singh's son Jawahar Singh put forward a claim to Poonch, and it was granted to him subject to the condition that he was to consult Gulab Singh on `all matters of importance'. He was also expected to present Gulab Singh one horse decked in gold trappings every year.{{sfn|Mridu Rai|2004}} After the death of Raja Jawahar Singh, Hari Singh dispossessed his young son of control over Poonch and set out to integrate it into his State. The move was unpopular in Poonch. The Mahajara's reign imposed a variety of new taxes and the Dogra troops were sent over to enforce collection.{{sfn|Schofield|2003|p=41}}\n\nThe [[Sudhan]] tribes of Poonch and Mirpur were war-like. They comprised the only Muslim troops in the Maharaja Hari Singh's army.{{sfn|Schofield|2003|p=17}} During the [[second world war]], over 60,000 of them fought in the British Army. After demobilization, they were forced to go back to farming because the Maharaja refused to accept them into his own army, and they faced the new taxation system of the Maharaja. In the Spring of 1947, they mounted a `no-tax' campaign, inviting severe reprisals from the Maharaja's government. In July, the Maharaja ordered that all Muslims must surrender their arms to the authorities. However, as the [[Partition of India|Partition]] violence spread, the same arms were reportedly distributed to the non-Muslims. These tensions led to an [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|uprising in Poonch]].{{sfn|Schofield|2003|p=41}}\n\n== Creation of Azad Jammu & Kashmir ==\n{{See also|1947 Poonch Rebellion}}\nAt the time of the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the British abandoned their [[suzerainty]] over the [[princely states]], which were left with the options of joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent.
