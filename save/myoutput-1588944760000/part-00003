A [[scenic overlook]] near the pass allows visitors to take in the [[alpine tundra]] environment above [[treeline]], and offers excellent views to the east of [[Mount Elbert]], Colorado's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the [[contiguous United States]]. [[Rock climbing|Rock climbers]] are drawn to nearby [[bouldering]] opportunities, and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation. [[Backcountry skiing|Backcountry skiers]] make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer. Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the [[USA Pro Cycling Challenge]].\n\nThe pass was formed by glacial action and erosion in the region, and its first recorded sighting was by [[Zebulon Pike]] in 1806. [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Ferdinand Hayden]] surveyed it in 1873. As part of the Continental Divide, it was the limit of European settlement in the region at the time, with the land to the west reserved for the [[Ute people]]. Prospectors who defied governor [[Frederick Walker Pitkin]]'s order crossed the pass on July 4, 1879, giving it its current name and setting up [[Independence, Pitkin County, Colorado|a similarly named village]] (now a [[ghost town]]) to its west. A [[toll road]] built across the pass was abandoned and neglected after a railroad connection was made to Aspen. A new road replaced it in the 1920s; portions of the old route can still be seen along the western approach.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\">{{cite web|title=Independence Pass History|url=http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/SH82/independence-pass|publisher=[[Colorado Department of Transportation]]|date=June 25, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref> The Independence Pass Foundation, based in Aspen, works to repair damage to the pass's environment caused by both roads since 1984.\n\n==Geography==\nAt the pass, the main ridge of the [[Sawatch Range]], and thus the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], turns from running generally south to more southwesterly.

The former approach uses the narrow valley of the [[Roaring Fork River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Colorado River|Colorado]], which rises from [[Independence Lake (Colorado)|Independence Lake]] west of the pass.

Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock, particularly on the steep slope to the north. Snow lingers in some areas year-round. Adjacent to the road and parking area are small [[Vernal pool|ephemeral pools]] on the southwest, with a larger, permanent one north of the road.\n\n==History==\nLike the surrounding mountains, the pass was created by [[glaciation]] and [[erosion]] over thousands of years. Before European-American settlers arrived, it was in the territory of the [[Ute people|Ute]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe]]. One of the earliest sightings by a European-American was in 1806, when [[Zebulon Pike]], mapping the southern boundary of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], spotted the gap in what would later be named the [[Sawatch Range]] from the upper [[Arkansas River]] valley.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" /> It was not explored until [[Ferdinand Hayden]] and his team surveyed it in 1873. At the time it was known as Hunter Pass.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\" />\n\nThree years later, in 1876, Colorado became a state. At the time settlement had pushed as far west from its capital, [[Denver]], as [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]]. There was a variety of metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains, and some miners had become rich from their [[mineral rights|claims]] there. Those who had not been so successful heard about reports from [[prospecting|prospectors]] of abundant silver deposits further west, over the Divide.<ref name=\"Rorhrbough book\">{{cite book|last=Rohrbough|first=Malcolm J.|title=Aspen: The History of a Silver-Mining Town, 1879\u20131893|year=2000|publisher=[[University Press of Colorado]]|location=[[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]|isbn=978-0-87081-592-8|pages=18\u201319|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oKuVpd2mdQC&pg=PA18}}</ref>\n\n[[Governor of Colorado|Governor]] [[Frederick Walker Pitkin]] had ordered all settlers to stay to the east of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to [[Ashcroft, Colorado|Ashcroft]], an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher [[Cottonwood Pass]] through Taylor Park and then back over [[Taylor Pass (Colorado)|Taylor Pass]] to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160&nbsp;km) journey, 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" />\n\nOn July 4, 1879, a group from Leadville struck gold in the uppermost Roaring Fork valley below the pass. Four miles (6.4&nbsp;km) to the west, they established a settlement in the upper [[Roaring Fork Valley]] that eventually took the name [[Independence, Pitkin County, Colorado|Independence]] from [[Independence Day (United States)|the holiday]] on which it was established. The pass, the lake from which the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork]] rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well.<ref name=\"Rorhrbough book\" /> The Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company, established to build a road through to the camps in the lower Roaring Fork Valley, improved the original path over the pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses could be used for the trip.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" />\n\nIndependence grew quickly when more gold was found in the nearby mountains. Within two years of its settlement permanent buildings had replaced the original tents, and a mining concern from Leadville had bought up all the claims.<ref name=\"Rorhrbough book\" /> In two years they produced gold worth $190,000 (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|190000|1882|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}), funding the construction of a stamping mill and sawmill.<ref name=\"AHS site\">{{cite web|title=Independence Ghost Town |url=http://www.aspenhistorysociety.com/independencemuseum.html |publisher=Aspen Historical Society |year=2008 |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222005113/http://www.aspenhistorysociety.com/independencemuseum.html |archivedate=December 22, 2011 }}</ref> In [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], further down the valley, silver was found in even greater abundance than Independence's gold. B. Clark Wheeler, an early investor in those mines, funded the construction of a stage road to Leadville, the first road to cross the pass.<ref name=\"AHS site\" /> It opened in November 1881, with winter already in full swing at the pass.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" />\n\nThe road charged 25 cents (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|0.25|1882}}}} in modern dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches.<ref name=\"Colorado Above Treeline\" /> The tolls, collected at three separate gates, primarily reflected the cost of retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; they were able to keep the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed, with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10\u201325 hours and five changes of horses.<ref name=\"Gregory 150\">Gregory (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nH8Y4SyB0A8C&pg=PA150 150].</ref>\n[[File:Abandoned log cabins, Independence, CO.jpg|thumb|left|Some of the remaining buildings of Independence, 2010.|alt=Two log cabins with metal roofs in the distance down a rolling slope. The remains of another are partially visible closer to the camera]]\nThe road improved Independence's economy, since coaches often stopped there on the multi-day journey. However, the year of its construction would turn out to be the settlement's economic peak year. Gold production dropped off after 1884. Independence's decline in population, remote location and severe high-altitude winters cost it the opportunity to be [[county seat|seat]] of newly formed [[Pitkin County, Colorado|Pitkin County]] to Aspen, located on a larger plain further down the river and growing much more rapidly due to the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. When a rail connection was made to that city in 1888, the stage road fell into disuse, further hurting Independence's economy. All but one of the remaining residents decamped as a group to Aspen on improvised [[cross-country skis]] during the severe winter of 1899.<ref name=\"AHS site\" /> The holdout, J.R. Williams, remained until 1920. The nearby Williams Mountains were named for him.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\" />\n\nBy then Aspen's prosperity had receded as well. Congress repealed the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] in response to the [[Panic of 1893]], which took the largest buyer of the city's silver out of the market. Aspen began a period of steady decline known today as \"the quiet years\" as mines gradually closed down. The route over the pass remained useful, however. In 1895 a telephone line was routed over it.<ref name=\"city website history page\">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.aspenpitkin.com/Exploring-the-Valley/History/|publisher=[[Aspen, Colorado|City of Aspen]]/[[Pitkin County, Colorado|Pitkin County]]|date=2002\u20132008|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough its population had dropped below a thousand by the late 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\" /> Unlike the stage road, it was closed during the winter months. While most of the old route was used for the new road, a portion of the original grade remains three miles below the pass on the east side. It includes the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] of the gatekeeper's house and the remains of the gate.<ref name=\"Colorado Above Treeline\" />\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], another large public works project involved the pass. The federal [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) oversaw the construction of the Twin Lakes Tunnel, which diverted water from Grizzly Reservoir, on Lincoln Creek, a southern tributary of the Roaring Fork, to Twin Lakes, where it was used for [[irrigation]] purposes by beet and watermelon farmers in the [[Rocky Ford, Colorado|Rocky Ford]] and [[Ordway, Colorado|Ordway]] areas. Starting in 1935, 50,000 [[acre-foot|acre-feet]] (about 61.7 million m\u00b3) were made available this way.<ref name=\"A Colorado History\">{{cite book|last=Uhbellohde|first=Carl|title=A Colorado History|year=2006|publisher=Pruett Publishing|location=[[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]|isbn=9780871089427|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRZKwjiPJZoC&pg=PA306 |author2=Smith, Duane |author3=Benson, Maxine|accessdate=August 26, 2012|page=306}}</ref>\n[[File:La Plata Peak from Independence Pass.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[La Plata Peak]] from the pass|alt=A view of mountainous terrain with a forested valley at the bottom rising to bare slopes with snowfields higher up.

A travel guidebook for automobile touring produced by the [[Federal Writers' Project]] gave as one route the trip along Highway 82 from Twin Lakes. It noted the distinctive landscape of the pass:\n\n{{quote|The highway rises in a series of loops and curves towards the Continental Divide.

Visitors to Aspen generally had to take Highway 82 up from [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]] or fly in, as few wanted to drive over the unpaved pass road. In 1967 the State Highway Department remedied this by paving the road over the pass. It has since been designated part of Colorado's \"[[Top of the Rockies]]\" scenic byway by the [[Colorado Department of Transportation|state]] and [[United States Department of Transportation|federal]] departments of transportation.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\" />\n\n==Environment==\nThe [[alpine tundra|alpine]] [[biome]] of the pass extends below it on either side to an elevation of approximately {{convert|11500|ft}}, or about the altitude of the [[Linkins Lake]] [[trailhead]] on the western side, Highway 82's uppermost crossing of the Roaring Fork. Below it is a [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|subalpine zone]] where [[lodgepole pine]], [[Engelmann spruce]], [[subalpine fir]] and [[aspen]] dominate the forest.

Before European-American settlers arrived, it was in the territory of the [[Ute people|Ute]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe]]. One of the earliest sightings by a European-American was in 1806, when [[Zebulon Pike]], mapping the southern boundary of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], spotted the gap in what would later be named the [[Sawatch Range]] from the upper [[Arkansas River]] valley.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" /> It was not explored until [[Ferdinand Hayden]] and his team surveyed it in 1873. At the time it was known as Hunter Pass.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\" />\n\nThree years later, in 1876, Colorado became a state. At the time settlement had pushed as far west from its capital, [[Denver]], as [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]]. There was a variety of metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains, and some miners had become rich from their [[mineral rights|claims]] there. Those who had not been so successful heard about reports from [[prospecting|prospectors]] of abundant silver deposits further west, over the Divide.<ref name=\"Rorhrbough book\">{{cite book|last=Rohrbough|first=Malcolm J.|title=Aspen: The History of a Silver-Mining Town, 1879\u20131893|year=2000|publisher=[[University Press of Colorado]]|location=[[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]|isbn=978-0-87081-592-8|pages=18\u201319|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oKuVpd2mdQC&pg=PA18}}</ref>\n\n[[Governor of Colorado|Governor]] [[Frederick Walker Pitkin]] had ordered all settlers to stay to the east of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to [[Ashcroft, Colorado|Ashcroft]], an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher [[Cottonwood Pass]] through Taylor Park and then back over [[Taylor Pass (Colorado)|Taylor Pass]] to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160&nbsp;km) journey, 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" />\n\nOn July 4, 1879, a group from Leadville struck gold in the uppermost Roaring Fork valley below the pass. Four miles (6.4&nbsp;km) to the west, they established a settlement in the upper [[Roaring Fork Valley]] that eventually took the name [[Independence, Pitkin County, Colorado|Independence]] from [[Independence Day (United States)|the holiday]] on which it was established. The pass, the lake from which the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork]] rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well.<ref name=\"Rorhrbough book\" /> The Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company, established to build a road through to the camps in the lower Roaring Fork Valley, improved the original path over the pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses could be used for the trip.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" />\n\nIndependence grew quickly when more gold was found in the nearby mountains. Within two years of its settlement permanent buildings had replaced the original tents, and a mining concern from Leadville had bought up all the claims.<ref name=\"Rorhrbough book\" /> In two years they produced gold worth $190,000 (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|190000|1882|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}), funding the construction of a stamping mill and sawmill.<ref name=\"AHS site\">{{cite web|title=Independence Ghost Town |url=http://www.aspenhistorysociety.com/independencemuseum.html |publisher=Aspen Historical Society |year=2008 |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222005113/http://www.aspenhistorysociety.com/independencemuseum.html |archivedate=December 22, 2011 }}</ref> In [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], further down the valley, silver was found in even greater abundance than Independence's gold. B. Clark Wheeler, an early investor in those mines, funded the construction of a stage road to Leadville, the first road to cross the pass.<ref name=\"AHS site\" /> It opened in November 1881, with winter already in full swing at the pass.<ref name=\"Colorado Scenic Guide\" />\n\nThe road charged 25 cents (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|0.25|1882}}}} in modern dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches.<ref name=\"Colorado Above Treeline\" /> The tolls, collected at three separate gates, primarily reflected the cost of retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; they were able to keep the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed, with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10\u201325 hours and five changes of horses.<ref name=\"Gregory 150\">Gregory (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nH8Y4SyB0A8C&pg=PA150 150].</ref>\n[[File:Abandoned log cabins, Independence, CO.jpg|thumb|left|Some of the remaining buildings of Independence, 2010.|alt=Two log cabins with metal roofs in the distance down a rolling slope.

However, the year of its construction would turn out to be the settlement's economic peak year. Gold production dropped off after 1884. Independence's decline in population, remote location and severe high-altitude winters cost it the opportunity to be [[county seat|seat]] of newly formed [[Pitkin County, Colorado|Pitkin County]] to Aspen, located on a larger plain further down the river and growing much more rapidly due to the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. When a rail connection was made to that city in 1888, the stage road fell into disuse, further hurting Independence's economy. All but one of the remaining residents decamped as a group to Aspen on improvised [[cross-country skis]] during the severe winter of 1899.<ref name=\"AHS site\" /> The holdout, J.R. Williams, remained until 1920. The nearby Williams Mountains were named for him.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\" />\n\nBy then Aspen's prosperity had receded as well. Congress repealed the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] in response to the [[Panic of 1893]], which took the largest buyer of the city's silver out of the market. Aspen began a period of steady decline known today as \"the quiet years\" as mines gradually closed down. The route over the pass remained useful, however. In 1895 a telephone line was routed over it.<ref name=\"city website history page\">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.aspenpitkin.com/Exploring-the-Valley/History/|publisher=[[Aspen, Colorado|City of Aspen]]/[[Pitkin County, Colorado|Pitkin County]]|date=2002\u20132008|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough its population had dropped below a thousand by the late 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82.<ref name=\"CODOT history page\" /> Unlike the stage road, it was closed during the winter months.

The federal [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) oversaw the construction of the Twin Lakes Tunnel, which diverted water from Grizzly Reservoir, on Lincoln Creek, a southern tributary of the Roaring Fork, to Twin Lakes, where it was used for [[irrigation]] purposes by beet and watermelon farmers in the [[Rocky Ford, Colorado|Rocky Ford]] and [[Ordway, Colorado|Ordway]] areas.
