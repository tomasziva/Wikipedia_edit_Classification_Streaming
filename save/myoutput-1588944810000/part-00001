The men of their semi-nomadic society were mobilised{{by whom|date=November 2018}} into [[commando]] units of mounted gunmen, but chose to leave Dutch society. Also like the [[Boer]]s, they migrated inland from the Cape, and in the 19th century established several states in what are now [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]].\n\nDuring the [[apartheid]] era (1948\u20131991), officialdom classified the Griqua people as \"Coloureds\"[15], assuming lineage of supposed \"mixed-race unions\".\n\n==Name==\nThe Griqua are a racially and culturally mixed people{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} who are primarily descended from the intermarriages and sexual relations between European colonist men and primarily [[Khoikhoi]] women{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

Later the Europeans chose mixed-race women of the Khoikhoi, who were living in the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] during the 17th and 18th centuries{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. As time went on, mixed-race people began to marry among themselves, establishing a distinct ethnic group that tended to be more assimilated to Dutch and European ways than tribal peoples in separated villages.\n\nThe mixed-race groups that developed in the early [[Cape Colony]] adopted different names for themselves, including ''Bastaards'', ''[[Baster]]s'', ''Korana'', ''[[Oorlam people|Oorlam]]'' or Oorlam Afrikaners, and ''Griqua''. Like the [[Afrikaners]] or \"Boers\" as they were known in that time, many of these groups migrated inland to escape British colonial rule{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.The word \"Afrikaner\" was for over 350 years used as a description for a mixed race bastard child but in 1876 a group of Boer intellectuals, who named themselves \"The fellowship of real Afrikaners\", decided to use the term as a new means to describe the Boer peoples, as part of the project to create a new national identity for pioneer Boer people in their fight against the British and for more powerful political legitimacy.Which is why today many Afrikaans speaking white people are still known as Afrikaners as this message was powerfully conveyed as a national identity during the times of the South African Union(1910-1961) and the Apartheid years of the Republic of South Africa.\n\nAccording to the 18th-century Dutch historian [[Isaak Tirion]], the Khoi name ''Griqua'' (or ''Grigriqua'') is first recorded in 1730 in reference to a group of people living in the northeastern section of the Cape Colony.<ref>[http://www.tanap.net/content/activities/documents/resolutions_Cape_of_Good_Hope/landkaart.htm Landkaart Kaap de Goede Hoop<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1813, Reverend John Campbell of the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) used the term Griqua to describe a [[mixed-race]] group of ''Chariguriqua'' (a Cape Khoikhoi group), ''Bastaards'', ''Korana'', and ''Tswana'' living at the site of present-day [[Griekwastad]] (then known as Klaarwater).<ref>[http://www.places.co.za/html/griekwastad.html Griekwastad<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The British found their \"proud name\", ''Bastaards'', offensive, so the LMS called them Griqua.\n\nBecause of a common ancestor named Griqua and shared links to the Chariguriqua (Grigriqua), the people officially changed their name to the Griqua.<ref>Monica Wilson and Leonard Thompson, ''The Oxford History of South Africa: Volume I'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969); 70.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin and early history===\n[[File:Coloured Trek-boer nomads - Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|Mixed-race \"Afrikander\" trek-boer nomads in the Cape Colony, ancestral people to the great Griqua migration.]]\n[[File:Griquatown - Griqua 1820 SA.jpg|thumb|An 1820 drawing of a street scene in [[Griekwastad|Griquatown]], [[Griqualand West]].]]\n\nBefore the whiteman came small families of Hottentots lived happily in tight-knit villages throughout the area now known as Cape Town. In 1652 Van Riebeeck and the first settlers used western logic to acquire the land that the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-indische Compagnie or VOC) wanted as a staging post for passing ships. Within years the Hottentots had been displaced as they realised that the Dutch were unlike any antagonists they had faced before. The Dutch were there to stay and were establishing a more permanent hold when they started building the distinctive looking Fort with its incredibly thick walls. The Khoi Khoi fought two wars with the Dutch, and, had they persisted, they probably would have pushed them back into the sea. Unfortunately, they treated the Dutch like other native tribes, and just stole their cattle, thinking that this loss would drive them away. They had no way of knowing the power behind the enterprise backing up the Dutch sailors who visited their shores and started occupying their lands. [13]\n\n\nLand Rights\nThe [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) did not intend for its [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] possessions at the southern tip of Africa to develop into a political entity. As the colony expanded and became more successful, its leadership did not worry about its frontiers. As a result, the frontier of the colony was indeterminate and ebbed and flowed at the whim of individuals. While the VOC undoubtedly benefited from the trading and pastoral endeavours of the [[Trekboer]]s, it did little to control or support them in their quest for land. The high proportion of single Dutch men led to many taking indigenous women as wives and companions, producing mixed-race children. These multiracial offspring gradually developed as a sizable population who spoke Dutch and were instrumental in developing the colony.\n\nThese children did not attain the social or legal status accorded their fathers, mostly because colonial laws recognised only Christian forms of marriage. This group became known as [[Baster]]s, derived from bastaard, the Dutch word for \"bastard\" (or \"crossbreed\"). On White owned farms, Bastaards or Basters, did more skilled jobs such as transport riders and craftsmen. They took these skills with them later into the interior. The term \"Bastaards\" originally denoted people with a greater \"civilisation\" and attachment to Christianity than the Khoikhoi or slaves. As part of the European colonists' paramilitary response to insurgent resistance from [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] peoples, they conscripted Basters men into [[commando]] units. This allowed the men to become skilled in lightly armed and mounted skirmish tactics. But many recruited to war chose to abandon Dutch society and strike out to pursue a way of life more in keeping with their maternal culture. The resulting stream of disgruntled Dutch-speaking marksmen leaving the Cape hobbled the primarily Dutch colonists' ability to crew commando units. It also created belligerent, skilled groups of opportunists who harassed indigenous populations along the [[Orange River]]. Once free of colonial rule, these groups referred to themselves as ''[[Oorlam people|Oorlam]]''. In particular, the group led by [[Klaas Afrikaner]] became notorious for its exploits. They attracted enough attention from the Dutch authorities that Afrikaner was eventually [[Rendition (law)|rendered]] to the colony and banished to [[Robben Island]] in 1761.<ref name=\"ref3\">Nigel Penn. 2005. ''The Forgotten Frontier''. {{ISBN|0-8214-1682-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe Griquas could trace their forefathers to two clans, the Koks and Barendse, the first made up mainly of Khoikhoi and the second of mixed European descent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Griqua origins |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/griqua |website=South African History Online}}</ref>\n\n===Griqua migrations===\n[[File:David Arnot - Griqua agent and diplomat in the Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|David Arnot, a 19th-century Griqua lawyer and diplomat.]]\nOne of the most influential of these Oorlam groups was the Griqua. In the 19th century, the Griqua controlled several political entities which were governed by ''Kapteins'' (Dutch for \"Captain\") and their councils, with their own written constitutions.<ref name=\"ref2\">Jeroen G. Zandberg. 2005. ''Rehoboth Griqua Atlas''. {{ISBN|90-808768-2-8}}.</ref> On the insistence of the missionary John Campbell, they came up with the name Griqua. They established a basic system of government based on leaders known as ''kaptyns'' and magistrates drawn from the leading families. Prominent families included were the Kok and Barends families, and the Waterboer family complex.The first Griqua ''Kaptein'' was Adam Kok I, a former [[Slavery in South Africa|slave]] who had bought his own freedom. Kok led his people north from the interior of the Cape Colony, likely to escape discrimination, before moving north again. He eventually led them beyond the Cape Colony, near the Orange River just west and south of what would eventually become the [[Boer Republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], respectively.<ref>Christopher Saunders, ''Historical Dictionary of South Africa'' (London: The Scarecrow Press, 1983); 74.</ref> This area is where most of the tribe settled; although some remained nomadic. Prior to beginning their migrations, the Griqua had largely adopted what would be known as the [[Afrikaans|Afrikaans language]].\n\nThe Griquas founded a settlement called Klaarwater, later known as Griquatown. The Griqua communities were constantly bedevilled with internal divisions and environmental uncertainty. One of the greatest causes of tension was between wanting to be within the colonial fold with its security and economic opportunities versus wanting to maintain independence. Kok's successor, [[Andries Waterboer]], founded [[Griqualand West]], and controlled it until the influx of Europeans after the discovery of diamonds. In 1834, the Cape Colony recognised Waterboer's rights to his land and people. It signed a treaty with him to ensure payment by Europeans for the use of the land for mining. \n\n=== The Boers and Griqualand West ===\nThe Boers arrived in the area of Griquatown after Natal was taken over by the British. They acquired land from the Griqua, buying it in exchange for horses, liquor, firearms and ammunition. Trouble started when Kok arrested a Boer accused of ill-treating his people, and the trekker community tried to take over his entire territory. A British force stationed at Colesberg, quickly crossed the Orange River and defeated the settlers at Zwartkoppies.\n\nMaitland, who was Governor at the time, decided to put an end to the territorial ambitions of the Boers by inventing a complicated system of land tenure whereby each chief\u2019s land would be divided into two parts: one to be occupied by the chief and his people, and the other by the Boers who would pay rent to the chief and the Cape government.\n\nKok quickly agreed to this plan as it ensured that all regions south of the Riet River would remain inalienable Griqua property, while the area north of the river, although remaining under his control, would be leased by the Boers who were British subjects. In 1845, Maitland appointed a British Resident to Transorangia to oversee the implementation of this system, a job which Major Douglas Warden took over.\n\nMaitland\u2019s time as Governor came to an end in 1847 and was replaced by Sir Henry Pottinger, who was then soon replaced by Sir Henry George Wakelyn Smith. Smith rebuked Maitland\u2019s system of land tenure and declared that all rent from White tenant farmers on Griqua land north of the Riet River would divert to the Crown. In addition, Whites would be allowed to obtain farms to the south of the river in an area, in terms of Maitland\u2019s system, that could never be settled by Whites. Smith suitably humbled Adam Kok into acceptance of these terms.\n\nBy 1861, the Griquas, tired of the constant friction with their Dutch neighbours in the Orange Free State, sold them their lands, before settling in the territory of Griqualand East. In 1867, the discovery of diamonds near Hopetown brought about enormous changes in the social and economic make-up of the region. Overnight the area became flooded with fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and Australia. The ownership of this area became the subject of conflicting claims from the Khoikhoi, Tswana and Dutch groups.\n\nIn March 1871, the diamond field claims were resolved in favour of the Khoikhoi leader Nicolaas Waterboer, who immediately petitioned the British for the annexation of his lands to the Cape Colony. As a result, on 27 October 1871 the diamond fields were proclaimed a British territory under the name of Griqualand West.\n\nThe Griquas derived no benefit from this; they were merely pawns in the hands of the Imperial authorities who were trying to acquire control over the mineral rich lands. In November 1876, Lieutenant- Governor Lanyon cleverly embarked on a surveying process with the intention of confining indigenous Black people to strategically placed rural locations which comprised about ten percent of the original Griqualand. The divisions of Barkley West, Hay, Herbert and Kimberley were probably proclaimed at about the same time.\n\nHowever, the Cape Government, faced with the objections of both European settlers and indigenous residents, refused to incorporate the territory, and in 1873 Griqualand West was proclaimed a separate Crown Colony with its capital at Kimberley.\n\nIn 1876, Chief Waterboer, in whose name the diamond fields had been annexed, was arrested and imprisoned when he tried to free some of his followers from a prison work gang. On 5 August 1879, the Cape Parliament passed a Bill of Annexation, which was only implemented on 18 October 1880 (SESA 1972). A census taken in Griqualand West in 1877 revealed that the province had a total of 44,877 residents, of whom 12,374 were of European descent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=South African History Online|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/griqua|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Arrival in Nomansland (Griqualand East) ===\nIn 1860, Adam Kok III trekked from the vicinity of Philippolis, where they had lost their lands to the emigrant Boers, to find a new home. They arrived in 1862 in the territory known as No Man\u2019s Land, between the Cape and Natal. They lived in a larger for some ten years before founding their town of Kokstad.\n\nInsecure and distrustful, in 1869 Adam Kok requested that the territory of Griqualand East be annexed by the British, with the specific stipulation that it should not be brought under the direct rule of Natal even though he was granted full title to the land and total autonomy of government. Accordingly Griqualand was taken over in 1874, and although the Act of Annexation was passed by the Cape Parliament in 1877, it was not promulgated until 17 September 1879. The territory was initially divided into four magisterial districts centred at Matatiele, Mount Frere, Umzimkulu and Kokstad, later renamed Mount Currie.\n\nThroughout the 1870s, Griqualand East, and its surrounding territories, were the object of competing tribal interests and complex political alliances. As a result, the British found it difficult to implement effective colonial rule over the region until the remainder of Pondoland was also brought under their control. The lands of the Xesibe, centred at Mount Ayliff, were brought under their administration in 1878, but were not annexed to the Cape Colony until 25 October 1886.\n\nIn 1886, a small pocket of land called the Rode Valley was purchased from the Mpondo chief Umquikela, and was added to Mount Ayliff by Act No 45 of 1887, which was confirmed on 15 September 1888. The annexation of Pondoland to the Cape was completed under Act No 5 of 1894, provisions of which also ceded a portion of western Pondoland to Griqualand East. As a result of this transfer the divisions of Mount Fletcher, Qumbu, Tsolo and Maclear were brought under its administration.\n\nThe Griquas soon became a minority in the area and soon began to sell their properties to both European settlers and Pondo farmers, who were beginning to prosper there. The census of 1891 indicated that Griqualand East had a population of 152 618 persons, of whom 9 071 were literate. By 1904, these figures had risen to 222 685 and 21 146 respectively.\n\nBy 1917, the surviving Griqua people, highly demoralized by their loss of independence, once more trekked to a site near Touws River in the Karoo but their attempt to find a new community failed and most returned to Kokstad.<ref>{{Cite web|title=South African History Online|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/griqua|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Current situation==\n[[File:ApartheidPopulationGroups.jpg|thumb|\"Griqua\" listed as a separate ethnicity from \"[[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]]\" and \"Other Coloured\" on an apartheid-era identity document.]]\nDespite similarly mixed-race origins, those Coloured peoples identifying as [[Baster]]s are considered to be a separate ethnic group and live primarily in south-central [[Namibia]], while those who consider themselves Griqua are mostly located around Campbell and [[Griekwastad|Griquatown]] in the historic territory of Griqualand West in the [[Northern Cape]]; around the small Le Fleur Griqua settlement at [[Kranshoek]] in the [[Western Cape]]; and at [[Kokstad]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]].\n\nDue primarily to the racial policies of South Africa during the [[apartheid]] era, many Griqua people accepted classification in the larger \"Coloured\" group for fear that their Griqua roots might place them at a lower level than other groups. As a result, estimates of the size of the Griqua population are difficult to determine and remain largely unknown.\n\nGenetic evidence indicates that the majority of the present-day Griqua population is descended from a combination of European, Khoikhoi and [[Tswana people|Tswana]] ancestors, with a small percentage of [[San people|San]], or Bushmen, ancestry.<ref name=\"ref1\">Alan G.

The conference participates in cooperative research and development projects with the provincial government of the Western Cape and the [[University of the Free State]] in [[Bloemfontein]]. Members of the influential Le Fleur clan of Griqua are especially represented in this body.\n\nThe Griqua have also established their own church, known as the Griqua Church, which is [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The Church has a strong focus on maintaining Griqua cultural and ethnic identity.They are represented mostly in South Central Namibia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Little Known Black History Fact: Griqua People of South Africa |url=https://blackamericaweb.com/2012/07/24/little-known-black-history-fact-griqua-people-of-south-africa/ |website=blackamericaweb.com}}</ref>\n\nOne of several disputed theories as to the origin of [[Bloemfontein]]'s name connects it to the Griqua leader Jan Bloem (1775\u20131858). However, this may be a coincidence as ''Bloemfontein'' is Dutch for \"fountain of flowers\", or \"blooming fountain\", and the area could have been named for its local vegetation.\n\n==Griqualand==\n[[Image:BoerGriquaRepublics.svg|thumb|400px|right|Boer Republics and Griqua States in Southern Africa, 19th century.]]\nSeveral areas of South Africa became known as '''Griqualand''' when the group migrated inland from the Cape and established separate communities.\n\n* '''[[Griqualand East]]''' is the area around [[Kokstad]] on [[KwaZulu-Natal]]'s frontier with the [[Eastern Cape]]. This area was settled by, and subsequently named after, [[Adam Kok III]], who led more than 2,000 Griqua over the [[Drakensberg]] in 1861. Griqua descendants are now largely concentrated in Kokstad, where the Griqua Church is a center of the community.  In 1927, The Reformer (Andrew Andries Stockenstrom Le Fleur) led the last trek of Griqua people from Kokstad. People from Elandsdrif (Cradock), Trompsburg, Louisvale, etc. joined this trek. These people were originally settled at Keurvlakte (Nature's Valley), where they established themselves as fishermen and farmers. This trek was to play an important role in the eventual settlement of Griqua people from across the country in that area.\n\nIn 1939 The Reformer started negotiations with a farmer, a certain Van Rooyen, for hiring parts of a farm, Kranshoek, for use by the Griqua people and a site for his burial at Robberg in the future. His son, Thomas le Fleur, continued the negotiations after his death. At that time, The Reformer lived on a farm called Jakkalskraal, close to Kranshoek.\n\nThe Reformer died in a house adjacent to the site of his tomb at Robberg on 11 June 1941. It is still a regular place of pilgrimage for the Griqua people of South Africa. After his death, his eldest son Abraham Le Fleur succeeded him as leader of the Griqua people. [14]\n* '''[[Griqualand West]]''' historical and contemporary region in Northern Cape province, South Africa. The region lies directly northwest of the juncture of the Vaal and Orange rivers. It is an arid plateau settled in the late 18th century by the Griqua, a group of mixed white and Khoekhoe ancestry fleeing discrimination around Cape Town. Many were seminomadic, living by raiding and hunting, while others raised cattle near springs. Diamonds discovered in the area in 1867 led to disputed claims between the Boer republics, the Griqua, and the British Cape Colony. In 1871 the British formally annexed Griqualand West, incorporating it into the Cape Colony nine years later. Most Griqua were forced to sell their farms to whites. Very few remained in the area by the end of the 19th century. Diamonds continue to be mined in Griqualand West, and cattle and sheep are grazed. The rich deposits of the Finsch diamond pipe mine east of Postmasburg have been worked since 1963 by De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. The main town is Kimberley.<ref>{{cite web |title=Griqualand West |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Griqualand-West |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n\nThis is the area around [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], which became an important mining town in the decades following the first local discovery of diamonds in 1866. Kimberley is also known for its sports teams, including the [[Griquas (rugby)|Griquas]] rugby team, which competes in South Africa's annual [[Currie Cup]] tournament and contests its home matches at [[Griqua Park]].\n\n==Notable Griqua People==\n* [[Adam Kok III]]\n* [[Cornelius Kok I]]\n* [[Adam Kok I]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Baster]]s\n* [[Oorlam people|Oorlam]]\n* [[Coloureds]]\n* [[Cape Coloureds]]\n* [[Khoisan]]\n* [[Hapa]]\n* [[Mestizo]]\n* [[Mulatto]]\n* [[Afrikaners]]\n* [[Griqua coinage]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n13.

Like the [[Afrikaners]] or \"Boers\" as they were known in that time, many of these groups migrated inland to escape British colonial rule{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.The word \"Afrikaner\" was for over 350 years used as a description for a mixed race bastard child but in 1876 a group of Boer intellectuals, who named themselves \"The fellowship of real Afrikaners\", decided to use the term as a new means to describe the Boer peoples, as part of the project to create a new national identity for pioneer Boer people in their fight against the British and for more powerful political legitimacy.Which is why today many Afrikaans speaking white people are still known as Afrikaners as this message was powerfully conveyed as a national identity during the times of the South African Union(1910-1961) and the Apartheid years of the Republic of South Africa.\n\nAccording to the 18th-century Dutch historian [[Isaak Tirion]], the Khoi name ''Griqua'' (or ''Grigriqua'') is first recorded in 1730 in reference to a group of people living in the northeastern section of the Cape Colony.<ref>[http://www.tanap.net/content/activities/documents/resolutions_Cape_of_Good_Hope/landkaart.htm Landkaart Kaap de Goede Hoop<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1813, Reverend John Campbell of the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) used the term Griqua to describe a [[mixed-race]] group of ''Chariguriqua'' (a Cape Khoikhoi group), ''Bastaards'', ''Korana'', and ''Tswana'' living at the site of present-day [[Griekwastad]] (then known as Klaarwater).<ref>[http://www.places.co.za/html/griekwastad.html Griekwastad<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The British found their \"proud name\", ''Bastaards'', offensive, so the LMS called them Griqua.\n\nBecause of a common ancestor named Griqua and shared links to the Chariguriqua (Grigriqua), the people officially changed their name to the Griqua.<ref>Monica Wilson and Leonard Thompson, ''The Oxford History of South Africa: Volume I'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969); 70.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin and early history===\n[[File:Coloured Trek-boer nomads - Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|Mixed-race \"Afrikander\" trek-boer nomads in the Cape Colony, ancestral people to the great Griqua migration.]]\n[[File:Griquatown - Griqua 1820 SA.jpg|thumb|An 1820 drawing of a street scene in [[Griekwastad|Griquatown]], [[Griqualand West]].]]\n\nBefore the whiteman came small families of Hottentots lived happily in tight-knit villages throughout the area now known as Cape Town. In 1652 Van Riebeeck and the first settlers used western logic to acquire the land that the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-indische Compagnie or VOC) wanted as a staging post for passing ships. Within years the Hottentots had been displaced as they realised that the Dutch were unlike any antagonists they had faced before. The Dutch were there to stay and were establishing a more permanent hold when they started building the distinctive looking Fort with its incredibly thick walls. The Khoi Khoi fought two wars with the Dutch, and, had they persisted, they probably would have pushed them back into the sea. Unfortunately, they treated the Dutch like other native tribes, and just stole their cattle, thinking that this loss would drive them away. They had no way of knowing the power behind the enterprise backing up the Dutch sailors who visited their shores and started occupying their lands. [13]\n\n\nLand Rights\nThe [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) did not intend for its [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] possessions at the southern tip of Africa to develop into a political entity. As the colony expanded and became more successful, its leadership did not worry about its frontiers. As a result, the frontier of the colony was indeterminate and ebbed and flowed at the whim of individuals. While the VOC undoubtedly benefited from the trading and pastoral endeavours of the [[Trekboer]]s, it did little to control or support them in their quest for land. The high proportion of single Dutch men led to many taking indigenous women as wives and companions, producing mixed-race children. These multiracial offspring gradually developed as a sizable population who spoke Dutch and were instrumental in developing the colony.\n\nThese children did not attain the social or legal status accorded their fathers, mostly because colonial laws recognised only Christian forms of marriage. This group became known as [[Baster]]s, derived from bastaard, the Dutch word for \"bastard\" (or \"crossbreed\"). On White owned farms, Bastaards or Basters, did more skilled jobs such as transport riders and craftsmen. They took these skills with them later into the interior. The term \"Bastaards\" originally denoted people with a greater \"civilisation\" and attachment to Christianity than the Khoikhoi or slaves. As part of the European colonists' paramilitary response to insurgent resistance from [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] peoples, they conscripted Basters men into [[commando]] units. This allowed the men to become skilled in lightly armed and mounted skirmish tactics. But many recruited to war chose to abandon Dutch society and strike out to pursue a way of life more in keeping with their maternal culture. The resulting stream of disgruntled Dutch-speaking marksmen leaving the Cape hobbled the primarily Dutch colonists' ability to crew commando units. It also created belligerent, skilled groups of opportunists who harassed indigenous populations along the [[Orange River]]. Once free of colonial rule, these groups referred to themselves as ''[[Oorlam people|Oorlam]]''. In particular, the group led by [[Klaas Afrikaner]] became notorious for its exploits. They attracted enough attention from the Dutch authorities that Afrikaner was eventually [[Rendition (law)|rendered]] to the colony and banished to [[Robben Island]] in 1761.<ref name=\"ref3\">Nigel Penn. 2005. ''The Forgotten Frontier''. {{ISBN|0-8214-1682-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe Griquas could trace their forefathers to two clans, the Koks and Barendse, the first made up mainly of Khoikhoi and the second of mixed European descent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Griqua origins |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/griqua |website=South African History Online}}</ref>\n\n===Griqua migrations===\n[[File:David Arnot - Griqua agent and diplomat in the Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|David Arnot, a 19th-century Griqua lawyer and diplomat.]]\nOne of the most influential of these Oorlam groups was the Griqua. In the 19th century, the Griqua controlled several political entities which were governed by ''Kapteins'' (Dutch for \"Captain\") and their councils, with their own written constitutions.<ref name=\"ref2\">Jeroen G. Zandberg. 2005. ''Rehoboth Griqua Atlas''. {{ISBN|90-808768-2-8}}.</ref> On the insistence of the missionary John Campbell, they came up with the name Griqua. They established a basic system of government based on leaders known as ''kaptyns'' and magistrates drawn from the leading families. Prominent families included were the Kok and Barends families, and the Waterboer family complex.The first Griqua ''Kaptein'' was Adam Kok I, a former [[Slavery in South Africa|slave]] who had bought his own freedom. Kok led his people north from the interior of the Cape Colony, likely to escape discrimination, before moving north again. He eventually led them beyond the Cape Colony, near the Orange River just west and south of what would eventually become the [[Boer Republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], respectively.<ref>Christopher Saunders, ''Historical Dictionary of South Africa'' (London: The Scarecrow Press, 1983); 74.</ref> This area is where most of the tribe settled; although some remained nomadic. Prior to beginning their migrations, the Griqua had largely adopted what would be known as the [[Afrikaans|Afrikaans language]].\n\nThe Griquas founded a settlement called Klaarwater, later known as Griquatown. The Griqua communities were constantly bedevilled with internal divisions and environmental uncertainty. One of the greatest causes of tension was between wanting to be within the colonial fold with its security and economic opportunities versus wanting to maintain independence. Kok's successor, [[Andries Waterboer]], founded [[Griqualand West]], and controlled it until the influx of Europeans after the discovery of diamonds. In 1834, the Cape Colony recognised Waterboer's rights to his land and people. It signed a treaty with him to ensure payment by Europeans for the use of the land for mining. \n\n=== The Boers and Griqualand West ===\nThe Boers arrived in the area of Griquatown after Natal was taken over by the British. They acquired land from the Griqua, buying it in exchange for horses, liquor, firearms and ammunition. Trouble started when Kok arrested a Boer accused of ill-treating his people, and the trekker community tried to take over his entire territory. A British force stationed at Colesberg, quickly crossed the Orange River and defeated the settlers at Zwartkoppies.\n\nMaitland, who was Governor at the time, decided to put an end to the territorial ambitions of the Boers by inventing a complicated system of land tenure whereby each chief\u2019s land would be divided into two parts: one to be occupied by the chief and his people, and the other by the Boers who would pay rent to the chief and the Cape government.\n\nKok quickly agreed to this plan as it ensured that all regions south of the Riet River would remain inalienable Griqua property, while the area north of the river, although remaining under his control, would be leased by the Boers who were British subjects. In 1845, Maitland appointed a British Resident to Transorangia to oversee the implementation of this system, a job which Major Douglas Warden took over.\n\nMaitland\u2019s time as Governor came to an end in 1847 and was replaced by Sir Henry Pottinger, who was then soon replaced by Sir Henry George Wakelyn Smith. Smith rebuked Maitland\u2019s system of land tenure and declared that all rent from White tenant farmers on Griqua land north of the Riet River would divert to the Crown. In addition, Whites would be allowed to obtain farms to the south of the river in an area, in terms of Maitland\u2019s system, that could never be settled by Whites. Smith suitably humbled Adam Kok into acceptance of these terms.\n\nBy 1861, the Griquas, tired of the constant friction with their Dutch neighbours in the Orange Free State, sold them their lands, before settling in the territory of Griqualand East. In 1867, the discovery of diamonds near Hopetown brought about enormous changes in the social and economic make-up of the region. Overnight the area became flooded with fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and Australia. The ownership of this area became the subject of conflicting claims from the Khoikhoi, Tswana and Dutch groups.\n\nIn March 1871, the diamond field claims were resolved in favour of the Khoikhoi leader Nicolaas Waterboer, who immediately petitioned the British for the annexation of his lands to the Cape Colony. As a result, on 27 October 1871 the diamond fields were proclaimed a British territory under the name of Griqualand West.\n\nThe Griquas derived no benefit from this; they were merely pawns in the hands of the Imperial authorities who were trying to acquire control over the mineral rich lands. In November 1876, Lieutenant- Governor Lanyon cleverly embarked on a surveying process with the intention of confining indigenous Black people to strategically placed rural locations which comprised about ten percent of the original Griqualand. The divisions of Barkley West, Hay, Herbert and Kimberley were probably proclaimed at about the same time.\n\nHowever, the Cape Government, faced with the objections of both European settlers and indigenous residents, refused to incorporate the territory, and in 1873 Griqualand West was proclaimed a separate Crown Colony with its capital at Kimberley.\n\nIn 1876, Chief Waterboer, in whose name the diamond fields had been annexed, was arrested and imprisoned when he tried to free some of his followers from a prison work gang. On 5 August 1879, the Cape Parliament passed a Bill of Annexation, which was only implemented on 18 October 1880 (SESA 1972). A census taken in Griqualand West in 1877 revealed that the province had a total of 44,877 residents, of whom 12,374 were of European descent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=South African History Online|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/griqua|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Arrival in Nomansland (Griqualand East) ===\nIn 1860, Adam Kok III trekked from the vicinity of Philippolis, where they had lost their lands to the emigrant Boers, to find a new home. They arrived in 1862 in the territory known as No Man\u2019s Land, between the Cape and Natal. They lived in a larger for some ten years before founding their town of Kokstad.\n\nInsecure and distrustful, in 1869 Adam Kok requested that the territory of Griqualand East be annexed by the British, with the specific stipulation that it should not be brought under the direct rule of Natal even though he was granted full title to the land and total autonomy of government. Accordingly Griqualand was taken over in 1874, and although the Act of Annexation was passed by the Cape Parliament in 1877, it was not promulgated until 17 September 1879. The territory was initially divided into four magisterial districts centred at Matatiele, Mount Frere, Umzimkulu and Kokstad, later renamed Mount Currie.\n\nThroughout the 1870s, Griqualand East, and its surrounding territories, were the object of competing tribal interests and complex political alliances. As a result, the British found it difficult to implement effective colonial rule over the region until the remainder of Pondoland was also brought under their control. The lands of the Xesibe, centred at Mount Ayliff, were brought under their administration in 1878, but were not annexed to the Cape Colony until 25 October 1886.\n\nIn 1886, a small pocket of land called the Rode Valley was purchased from the Mpondo chief Umquikela, and was added to Mount Ayliff by Act No 45 of 1887, which was confirmed on 15 September 1888. The annexation of Pondoland to the Cape was completed under Act No 5 of 1894, provisions of which also ceded a portion of western Pondoland to Griqualand East. As a result of this transfer the divisions of Mount Fletcher, Qumbu, Tsolo and Maclear were brought under its administration.\n\nThe Griquas soon became a minority in the area and soon began to sell their properties to both European settlers and Pondo farmers, who were beginning to prosper there. The census of 1891 indicated that Griqualand East had a population of 152 618 persons, of whom 9 071 were literate. By 1904, these figures had risen to 222 685 and 21 146 respectively.\n\nBy 1917, the surviving Griqua people, highly demoralized by their loss of independence, once more trekked to a site near Touws River in the Karoo but their attempt to find a new community failed and most returned to Kokstad.<ref>{{Cite web|title=South African History Online|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/griqua|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Current situation==\n[[File:ApartheidPopulationGroups.jpg|thumb|\"Griqua\" listed as a separate ethnicity from \"[[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]]\" and \"Other Coloured\" on an apartheid-era identity document.]]\nDespite similarly mixed-race origins, those Coloured peoples identifying as [[Baster]]s are considered to be a separate ethnic group and live primarily in south-central [[Namibia]], while those who consider themselves Griqua are mostly located around Campbell and [[Griekwastad|Griquatown]] in the historic territory of Griqualand West in the [[Northern Cape]]; around the small Le Fleur Griqua settlement at [[Kranshoek]] in the [[Western Cape]]; and at [[Kokstad]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]].\n\nDue primarily to the racial policies of South Africa during the [[apartheid]] era, many Griqua people accepted classification in the larger \"Coloured\" group for fear that their Griqua roots might place them at a lower level than other groups. As a result, estimates of the size of the Griqua population are difficult to determine and remain largely unknown.\n\nGenetic evidence indicates that the majority of the present-day Griqua population is descended from a combination of European, Khoikhoi and [[Tswana people|Tswana]] ancestors, with a small percentage of [[San people|San]], or Bushmen, ancestry.<ref name=\"ref1\">Alan G. Morris. 1997. \"The Griqua and the Khoikhoi: Biology, Ethnicity and the Construction of Identity\", in: ''Kronos Journal of Cape History'', No. 24, page 106 \u2013 118</ref>\n\nGriqua people are represented by the National Khoisan Consultative Conference (Afrikaans: ''Nasionale Khoe-San Oorlegplegende Konferensie''), which was established in [[Oudtshoorn]] in 2001 to represent the interests of South Africa's [[Khoisan]]id peoples. The conference participates in cooperative research and development projects with the provincial government of the Western Cape and the [[University of the Free State]] in [[Bloemfontein]]. Members of the influential Le Fleur clan of Griqua are especially represented in this body.\n\nThe Griqua have also established their own church, known as the Griqua Church, which is [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The Church has a strong focus on maintaining Griqua cultural and ethnic identity.They are represented mostly in South Central Namibia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Little Known Black History Fact: Griqua People of South Africa |url=https://blackamericaweb.com/2012/07/24/little-known-black-history-fact-griqua-people-of-south-africa/ |website=blackamericaweb.com}}</ref>\n\nOne of several disputed theories as to the origin of [[Bloemfontein]]'s name connects it to the Griqua leader Jan Bloem (1775\u20131858). However, this may be a coincidence as ''Bloemfontein'' is Dutch for \"fountain of flowers\", or \"blooming fountain\", and the area could have been named for its local vegetation.\n\n==Griqualand==\n[[Image:BoerGriquaRepublics.svg|thumb|400px|right|Boer Republics and Griqua States in Southern Africa, 19th century.]]\nSeveral areas of South Africa became known as '''Griqualand''' when the group migrated inland from the Cape and established separate communities.\n\n* '''[[Griqualand East]]''' is the area around [[Kokstad]] on [[KwaZulu-Natal]]'s frontier with the [[Eastern Cape]]. This area was settled by, and subsequently named after, [[Adam Kok III]], who led more than 2,000 Griqua over the [[Drakensberg]] in 1861. Griqua descendants are now largely concentrated in Kokstad, where the Griqua Church is a center of the community.  In 1927, The Reformer (Andrew Andries Stockenstrom Le Fleur) led the last trek of Griqua people from Kokstad. People from Elandsdrif (Cradock), Trompsburg, Louisvale, etc. joined this trek. These people were originally settled at Keurvlakte (Nature's Valley), where they established themselves as fishermen and farmers. This trek was to play an important role in the eventual settlement of Griqua people from across the country in that area.\n\nIn 1939 The Reformer started negotiations with a farmer, a certain Van Rooyen, for hiring parts of a farm, Kranshoek, for use by the Griqua people and a site for his burial at Robberg in the future. His son, Thomas le Fleur, continued the negotiations after his death. At that time, The Reformer lived on a farm called Jakkalskraal, close to Kranshoek.\n\nThe Reformer died in a house adjacent to the site of his tomb at Robberg on 11 June 1941. It is still a regular place of pilgrimage for the Griqua people of South Africa. After his death, his eldest son Abraham Le Fleur succeeded him as leader of the Griqua people. [14]\n* '''[[Griqualand West]]''' historical and contemporary region in Northern Cape province, South Africa. The region lies directly northwest of the juncture of the Vaal and Orange rivers. It is an arid plateau settled in the late 18th century by the Griqua, a group of mixed white and Khoekhoe ancestry fleeing discrimination around Cape Town. Many were seminomadic, living by raiding and hunting, while others raised cattle near springs. Diamonds discovered in the area in 1867 led to disputed claims between the Boer republics, the Griqua, and the British Cape Colony. In 1871 the British formally annexed Griqualand West, incorporating it into the Cape Colony nine years later. Most Griqua were forced to sell their farms to whites. Very few remained in the area by the end of the 19th century. Diamonds continue to be mined in Griqualand West, and cattle and sheep are grazed. The rich deposits of the Finsch diamond pipe mine east of Postmasburg have been worked since 1963 by De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. The main town is Kimberley.<ref>{{cite web |title=Griqualand West |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Griqualand-West |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n\nThis is the area around [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], which became an important mining town in the decades following the first local discovery of diamonds in 1866. Kimberley is also known for its sports teams, including the [[Griquas (rugby)|Griquas]] rugby team, which competes in South Africa's annual [[Currie Cup]] tournament and contests its home matches at [[Griqua Park]].\n\n==Notable Griqua People==\n* [[Adam Kok III]]\n* [[Cornelius Kok I]]\n* [[Adam Kok I]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Baster]]s\n* [[Oorlam people|Oorlam]]\n* [[Coloureds]]\n* [[Cape Coloureds]]\n* [[Khoisan]]\n* [[Hapa]]\n* [[Mestizo]]\n* [[Mulatto]]\n* [[Afrikaners]]\n* [[Griqua coinage]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n13.
