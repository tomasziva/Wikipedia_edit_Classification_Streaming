He was the son of third Pandava prince [[Arjuna]] and Yadava princess [[Subhadra]].\n\n==Origin==\n\nAbhimanyu was the re-incarnation of son of the Moon-God ''[[Chandra]]''. When Chandra was asked to let his son incarnate himself on earth, he made a pact that his son will only remain on earth for 16 years, as he could not bear to be separated from him any longer than that. So, Chandra's son was born as the son of [[Arjuna]] and [[Subhadra]]. Abhimanyu was the 3rd son of Arjuna. Abhimanyu was the most loved of all sons of the Pandavas, so much so that [[Draupadi]] was said to love him more than her own sons. Draupadi once said that if the Pandavas are not willing to wage war, then her sons led by Abhimanyu will attack and get justice for her. After the Virata war, King Virat offered princess [[Uttar\u0101 (Mahabharata)|Uttara]] to Arjuna in marriage. But Arjuna replied to Virat that he taught dance to Uttara, and a teacher could treat his/her student as a child, but not as a spouse. Arjuna accepted the offer instead by recommending to Virat that he could accept Uttara as daughter-in-law by marrying her with his son, Abhimanyu. King Virat was pleased and agreed to Arjuna's proposal, as Abhimanyu's greatness had already spread all over the Earth by that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01068.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Sambhava Parva: Section LXVII|publisher=|access-date=2 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025052201/http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01068.htm|archive-date=25 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology and epithets ==\n\n* Arjuna Putra (\u0905\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0941\u0928 \u092a\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930) - true successor of [[Arjuna]].

Abhimanyu and Uttara were already in love as Abhimanyu already met Uttara while he was in search of his parents who were in exile. This was noticed by [[Draupadi]] and [[Yudhishtira]]. Convinced by them, Abhimanyu planned to leave Matsya kingdom. Because if Abhimanyu had identified his parents, their exile would have become waste and they would have supposed to go in exile for another 13 years. Just before this incident, [[Kichaka]] was killed by [[Bhima]]. Hearing about the death of Kichaka, Duryodhana surmises that the Pandavas were hiding in Matsya. A host of Kaurava warriors attacked Virata, presumably to steal their cattle, but in reality, desiring to pierce the Pandavas' veil of anonymity. Taking this as advantage, Susharma attacked Matsya kingdom. Full of bravado, Virata's son Uttar attempts to take on the army by himself while the rest of the Matsya army has been lured away to fight Susharma and the Trigartas. At the same time [[Draupadi]] was kidnapped by Kichaka's 100 brothers. [[Bhima]], [[Nakula]] & [[Sahadeva]] went in search of her. [[Yudhishtira]] suggested King Virat to stay in palace and defend the kingdom by sending soldiers of Matsya kingdom to battlefield. While Abhimanyu was leaving to [[Dv\u0101rak\u0101|Dwaraka]], Uttara asked Abhimanyu to help. Abhimanyu led the Matsya army and defeated Susharma. After defeating [[Susharma]], Abhimanyu promised Uttara that one day he would definitely visit Matsya kingdom after completion of their parents' exile. As suggested by Draupadi, Uttar takes Brihannala with him, as his charioteer. When he sees the Kaurava army, Uttar loses his nerve and attempts to flee. There, Arjuna reveals his identity and those of his brothers'. Switching places with Uttar, Arjuna takes up the Gandiva and Devadatta. Eager to defend the land that had given him refuge, Arjuna engaged the legion of Kaurava warriors. All the warriors including [[Bhishma]], [[Drona]], [[Karna]], [[Kripa]] and [[Ashwatthama]] together attacked Arjuna to kill him but Arjuna defeated all of them multiple times. During the battle Arjuna also killed Sangramjit the foster brother of [[Karna]] and instead of taking the revenge of his brother, [[Karna]] took heroic flight in order to save his life from [[Arjuna]].\n\n==Kurukshethra war==\n[[File:Uttra Abhimanue.jpg|thumb|300px|Uttra and Abhimanyu]]\nOn the very first day, Abhimanyu faced legendary [[Bhishma]] and engaged in an archery duel with him. The battle was so intense that both of them were almost equal. Bhishma didn't want to kill his great grandson, so he didn't use celestial weapons. When Abhimanyu's arrows injured Bhishma, Bhishma asked Abhimanyu to get-out from his sight. Abhimanyu replied that he was son of [[Arjuna]] and the student of [[Krishna]]. If he would have escaped due to fear; it would become an insult to both of them. [[Bhishma]] felt proud on hearing this. Abhimanyu breaks [[Bhishma]]\u2019s bow. Then they involve in a sword duel just before the sunset. Bhishma appreciated Abhimanyu since Bhishma failed to defeat Abhimanyu. On 3rd day; Abhimanyu attacked [[Ashwatthama]] and drew [[Drona]]'s attention. [[Drona]] and [[Arjuna]] were involved in a fight. When Drona heard that his son was attacked by Abhimanyu, he immediately left that place and went to save his son. Drona and Abhimanyu soon engaged in an intense battle which made a clear way to [[Arjuna]] in assisting [[Bhima]] to reach [[Duryodhana]] and kill him. But their plans of killing Duryodhana and ending the war failed due to some reasons. Even Drona failed to defeat Abhimanyu.\nhj9-\n\n==Thirteenth Day==\n[[File:Abhimanyu showing his talent in Battle.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Abhimanyu showing his talent in Battle]]\nThe Kaurava commander-in-chief [[Dronacharya]] planned to divert [[Arjuna]] and [[Krishna]] away to chase an army of the samsaptakhas whom Arjuna defeated that very day. The Kaurava army was grouped into the giant discus formation, which caused great loss for the Pandavas. If the formation continued till end of that day, the pandavas would have no army by sunset. The only two people on the Pandava army who completely knew about how to enter and break this formation were Arjuna and Krishna, who were away.

But he did not know how to destroy the formation once he was inside, as Subhadra fell asleep while listening to the story and (Abhimanyu in her womb) could learn only half of the technique.

Kripa killed his two chariot-drivers, and Kritavarma killed his horses; Abhimanyu took up a sword and a shield but these weapons were cut off by [[Drona]] and [[Ashwatthama]] (though in other versions of the story, the perpetrators change while the acts remain the same). Abhimanyu then took up a chariot-wheel and started fighting with it, but [[Kripa]] cut the wheel. In this way, many warriors attacked the sixteen year old Abhimanyu when he was unarmed. Abhimanyu's body was pierced by dozens of arrows. But Abhimanyu faced all of the Kaurava warriors and still managed to kill many enemy soldiers. At last all warriors at once stab Abhimanyu from all sides which leads to his death.
