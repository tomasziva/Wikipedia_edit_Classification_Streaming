The team debuted on 22 April 1906, winning its match against [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]]. During its first season Atlanta reached the semifinals but then lost to Club Gath & Chaves by 2\u20130. That same year Atlanta merged with Club Atl\u00e9tico del Oeste, keeping its original name.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nAtlanta won the [[Primera C|third division]] championship in 1907, winning its first official title. The team defeated [[Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires]] by 4\u20131 on 10 November. The highlight of that season was the thrashing victory over [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]] by 21\u20131. After winning the title, Atlanta debuted in the [[Primera B Metropolitana|second division]] in 1908, winning the \"Copa Bullrich\" that played at the same time than regular season.

The rivalry originated in 1922, when Chacarita established very close to Atlanta's home and stadium. The ''Funebrero'' stayed there until 1930 when they moved to [[General San Mart\u00edn Partido|San Mart\u00edn]], in [[Greater Buenos Aires]], where they have remained since, although the rivalry with Atlanta never ended.\n\nThe first official match between both teams was on 13 November 1927 and Chacarita won 2\u20130. The first time Atlanta defeated the ''Funebrero'' was in 1930, with a score of 1\u20130. In the professional era, the first contest between Atlanta and Chacarita was on 4 June 1931, with Atlanta winning 3\u20131.\n\nAtlanta and Chacarita have played each other 126 times: Atlanta have won 34, scoring 144 goals. On the other side, Chacarita have won 54 games and scored 191 goals. They have drawn 38 times. The biggest win achieved by Atlanta was in 1944, when they defeated Chacarita 7\u20131.\n\nSantiago Rico played the most games for Atlanta with 16 appearances, while Luciano Agnol\u00edn is the top scorer with 7 goals.\n\n==Stadium==\nThe team stadium, \"Don Le\u00f3n Kolbovsky\", is located in [[Villa Crespo]] neighborhood, in the city of [[Buenos Aires]]. It was inaugurated in 1960 during a match between Atlanta and [[Argentinos Juniors]]. Its name is a tribute to the man who presided the club when the stadium began to be built and has a capacity of 34,000. It is also known as the \"Wooden Monumental\", in reference to [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate's]] [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]], the biggest and with the largest capacity in Argentina.\n\nIn February 2005, the [[List of Mayors and Chiefs of Government of Buenos Aires|Government of Buenos Aires]] closed the stadium due to its poor sanitary and security conditions. In January 2006 the stadium was partially re-opened but it was closed again a month later. The same year Atlanta signed a contract with a company to build two concrete grandstands which would replace the wooden one that still stood there. Once the restructuring was finished, Atlanta could play its home games in its own stadium after three years. The Le\u00f3n Kolbovsky was re-opened in March 2009, when Atlanta defeated [[Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol]] 3\u20131 with 6,000 supporters in the new concrete grandstands.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2009/03/29/um/m-01887196.htm \"Atlanta volvi\u00f3 a gozar en su cancha\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 2009-03-29</ref>\n\n==Nickname==\nSince the team lacked an official home stadium for its first six decades, it was nicknamed ''\"Los Bohemios\"'', as the team would wander from place to place forced to play \"home\" games in other team's stadiums. The label is also associated with the fans, or any supporter of the team. The singular form, \"El Bohemio\", is also accepted and can be used when referring to the organization, or a particular player or the actual team.\n\n==The \"footballer\" dog==\n[[File:Napoleon perro atlanta.jpg|thumb|right|150px|\"Napole\u00f3n\", the team's mascot, died in a car accident in 1938]]\nOne of the most curious cases in the history of the club refers to a dog, called \"Napole\u00f3n\" (whose name had been taken from the [[Napoleon|Emperor of the French]]) who would become a club legend. The dog had become famous in 1936, when before each match disputed by Atlanta, Napole\u00f3n used to show his skills with the ball to the spectators at the Villa Crespo stadium. The animal's awesome ability was claimed even by rival supporters.<ref>\"Cr\u00f3nica sobre el perro Napole\u00f3n\", F\u00e9lix Frascara, ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' magazine, 1937</ref> The dog also barked fiercely when the rival team appeared on the field, and happily wagged his tail when Atlanta players appeared on the field. \"Once the referee started the match, Napole\u00f3n took his place outside the field and followed the movements of the ball. During a corner kick, the dog always stood behind the goal\"<ref>from an interview to Jan Di Sanzi, a nephew of Napole\u00f3n's owner, Francisco Bel\u00f3n, ''Diario Ol\u00e9'' of Buenos Aires</ref>\n\n[[File:Atlanta 1936.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Napole\u00f3n posing with the team in 1936]]\nNapole\u00f3n had been adopted by Atlanta players after a match against [[Talleres de Remedios de Escalada|Talleres]] played in [[Remedios de Escalada]]: with the dog on the field, Atlanta scored 4 goals in the second half after being 5\u20131 down at half-time (when Napole\u00f3n could not stay with the team on field). The match finally ended with a 5\u20135 tie and therefore the dog was adopted by Atlanta players as their mascot, because they considered the dog had brought good luck to the team.\n\nOn 6 April 1938, a group of Atlanta supporters met at the house of Napole\u00f3n's owner, Francisco Bel\u00f3n. They were making the arrangements to take Napole\u00f3n to [[La Plata, Buenos Aires|La Plata]] for the match Atlanta had to play against [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]]. The front door of the house was left opened and the dog ran into the street, and was killed by a car. The newspaper ''Ahora'' titled the next day: \"Napole\u00f3n, a true ace of ''[[Buenos Aires|Porte\u00f1o]]'' football, passed away\"<ref>[Chronicle about Napole\u00f3n death], ''Diario Ahora'', Buenos Aires, 1938-04-06</ref>\n\nNapole\u00f3n was not buried, but his body was embalmed and kept by his owner, Francisco Bel\u00f3n, in the house of Villa Crespo where he lived. On October 2004, when Atlanta celebrated its 100th anniversary, the embalmed body of Napol\u00e9on came back to the stadium (now called ''Le\u00f3n Kolvobsky'') being exhibited by Francisco Bel\u00f3n's son, Osvaldo.
