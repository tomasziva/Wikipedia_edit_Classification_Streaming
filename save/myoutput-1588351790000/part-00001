Henry was involved in the revolt of the [[Lords Appellant]] against Richard in 1388. He was later exiled by the king. After John of Gaunt died in 1399, the king did not allow Henry to inherit Gaunt's duchy. That year, Henry rallied a group of supporters, overthrew and imprisoned Richard II, and took the throne. \n\nAs king, Henry had to deal with rumours that Richard II, who had died in 1400, was still alive. He also faced a number of rebellions. [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], the self-proclaimed [[List of rulers of Wales|ruler of Wales]], [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|revolted]] against the king. Henry IV defeated [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403. The king had poor health in the latter part of his reign. Upon his death in 1413, he was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].\n\n==Siblings==\nHenry's elder sisters were [[Philippa, Queen of Portugal]], and [[Elizabeth of Lancaster, Duchess of Exeter]]. His younger half-sister, the daughter of his father's second wife, [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]], was [[Katherine, Queen of Castile]]. He also had four natural half-siblings born of [[Katherine Swynford]], originally his sisters' governess, then his father's longstanding mistress and later third wife. These illegitimate children were given the surname [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] from their birthplace at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Beaufort]] in [[Champagne, France]].<ref name=\"Armitage-Smith\">{{cite book| last=Armitage-Smith |first=Sydney |title=John of Gaunt |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aUutJGyx5EEC&pg=PA318 |year=1905 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |page=318}}<!-- |accessdate=17 July 2018--></ref>\n\nHenry's relationship with his stepmother, Katherine Swynford, was a positive one, but his relationship with the Beauforts varied. In youth he seems to have been close to all of them, but rivalries with [[Henry Beaufort|Henry]] and [[Thomas Beaufort]] proved problematic after 1406. [[Ralph Neville, 4th Baron Neville]], married Henry's half-sister [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]]. Neville remained one of his strongest supporters, and so did his eldest half-brother [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]], even though Henry revoked [[Richard II]]'s grant to John of a [[marquess]]ate. Thomas Swynford, a son from Katherine's first marriage, was another loyal companion. Thomas was Constable of [[Pontefract Castle]], where Richard II is said to have died.\n\nHenry's half-sister Joan was the mother of [[Cecily Neville]]. Cecily married [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York]], and had several offspring, including [[Edward IV]] and [[Richard III]], making Joan the grandmother of two [[Yorkist]] kings of England.\n\n==Relationship with Richard II==\n[[File:HenryBolingbrokeClaimsThrone.jpg|thumb|300px|Henry of Bolingbroke, flanked by the lords spiritual and temporal, claims the throne in 1399. From a contemporary manuscript, British Library, [[Harleian Collection]]]]\nHenry experienced a rather more inconsistent relationship with King Richard II than his father had. First cousins and childhood playmates, they were admitted together to the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1377, but Henry participated in the [[Lords Appellant]]s' rebellion against the king in 1387.<ref>B.

In fact, Richard elevated Henry from [[Earl of Derby]] to [[Duke of Hereford]].\n\nHenry spent the full year of 1390 supporting the unsuccessful siege of [[Vilnius]] (capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]) by [[Teutonic Knights]] with 70 to 80 household knights.{{sfn|Given-Wilson|2016|pp=66\u201368}} During this campaign he bought captured [[Lithuania]]n women and children and took them back to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] to be converted.{{sfn|Given-Wilson|2016|p=69}} Henry's second expedition to Lithuania in 1392 illustrates the financial benefits to the Order of these guest crusaders. His small army consisted of over 100 men, including [[longbow]] archers and six minstrels, at a total cost to the Lancastrian purse of \u00a34,360. Despite the efforts of Henry and his English crusaders, two years of attacks on Vilnius proved fruitless. In 1392\u201393 Henry undertook a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], where he made offerings at the [[Holy Sepulchre]] and at the [[Mount of Olives]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bevan|first=Bryan|title=Henry IV|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1994|page=[https://books.google.be/books?id=wsjq_H5uCagC&pg=PA32 32]|isbn=0-948695-35-8}}</ref> Later he vowed to lead a crusade to 'free Jerusalem from the infidel,' but he died before this could be accomplished.<ref>B.

In 1398, a remark by [[Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk]], regarding Richard II's rule was interpreted as treason by Henry and Henry reported it to the king.<ref>A.

Yet before the duel could take place, Richard decided to banish Henry from the kingdom (with the approval of Henry's father, John of Gaunt) to avoid further bloodshed. Mowbray himself was exiled for life.<ref name=\"Barr 1994 146\">H. Barr, ''Signes and Sothe: Language in the Piers Plowman Tradition'', Cambridge, 1994, p.

With Arundel as his advisor, Henry began a military campaign, confiscating land from those who opposed him and ordering his soldiers to destroy much of [[Cheshire]]. Henry initially announced that his intention was  to reclaim his rights as [[Duke of Lancaster]], though he quickly gained enough power and support to have himself declared King Henry IV, imprison King Richard (who died in prison under mysterious circumstances) and bypass Richard's 7-year-old [[heir-presumptive]], [[Edmund de Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]].<ref name=\"Bevan 1994 66\">B.

On Arundel's advice, Henry obtained from Parliament the enactment of ''[[De heretico comburendo]]'' in 1401, which prescribed the burning of [[heretics]], an act done mainly to suppress the [[Lollard]] movement.<ref name=\"SomersetHavens2003\">{{cite book|author1=Fiona Somerset|author2=Jill C.

From a 15th-century manuscript of [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''[[Froissart's Chronicles|Chronicles]]''.]]\n\n===The previous ruler===\nHenry's first major problem as monarch was what to do with the deposed Richard. After an early [[Epiphany Rising|assassination plot]] was foiled in January 1400, Richard died in prison aged 33, probably of starvation. Though Henry is often suspected of having his predecessor murdered, there is no substantial evidence to prove that claim. Some chroniclers claimed that the despondent Richard had starved himself,<ref name=tuck>Anthony Tuck, 'Richard II (1367\u20131400)', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref> which would not have been out of place with what is known of Richard's character. Though council records indicate that provisions were made for the transportation of the deposed king's body as early as 17 February, there is no reason to believe that he did not die on 14 February, as several chronicles stated. It can be positively said that he did not suffer a violent death, for his skeleton, upon examination, bore no signs of violence; whether he did indeed starve himself or whether that starvation was forced upon him are matters for lively historical speculation.<ref name=tuck/>\n[[File:Silver half groat of Henry IV (YORYM 1994 151 102) obverse.jpg|thumb|left|Silver half groat of Henry IV, York Museums Trust]]\nAfter his death, Richard's body was put on public display in the [[old St Paul's Cathedral]], both to prove to his supporters that he was truly dead and also to prove that he had not suffered a violent death. This did not stop rumours from circulating for years after that he was still alive and waiting to take back his throne. Henry had Richard discreetly buried in the [[King's Langley Priory|Dominican Priory]] at [[Kings Langley]], [[Hertfordshire]], where he remained until King Henry V brought his body back to London and buried him in the tomb that Richard had commissioned for himself in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Joel Burden, 'How Do You Bury a Deposed King?', in Henry IV: The Establishment of the Regime, 1399\u20131406, ed. Gwilym Dodd and Douglas Biggs (York: York Medieval Press, 2003), pp. 35\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Rebellions===\n{{House of Lancaster|henry4}}\nHenry spent much of his reign defending himself against plots, rebellions and assassination attempts. Rebellions continued throughout the first 10 years of Henry's reign, including the [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|revolt]] of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], who declared himself [[Prince of Wales]] in 1400, and the rebellions led by [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], from 1402. The rebellions of Henry Percy advanced into the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403. After this battle, Henry IV's son, [[Henry of Monmouth]] (later king), was left with an arrow penetrated in the left hand side of his face under his eye. He was cared for by the royal physician [[John Bradmore]]. Despite this, the Battle of Shrewsbury was left in a royalist victory. The king's success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son, Monmouth (though Monmouth managed to seize much effective power from his father in 1410).\n\nIn the last year of Henry's reign, the rebellions picked up speed. \"The old fable of a living Richard was revived\", notes one account, \"and emissaries from Scotland traversed the villages of England, in the last year of Henry's reign, declaring that Richard was residing at the Scottish Court, awaiting only a signal from his friends to repair to London and recover his throne.\"\n\nA suitable-looking impostor was found and King Richard's old groom circulated word in the city that his master was alive in Scotland. \"Southwark was incited to insurrection\" by Sir Elias Lyvet ([[Levett]]) and his associate Thomas Clark, who promised Scottish aid in carrying out the insurrection. Ultimately, the rebellion came to naught. Lyvet was released and Clark thrown into the Tower.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oqMuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=lyvet+king#PPA233,M1 |title=The Book of the Princes of Wales, Heirs to the Crown of England, Dr. John Doran, London, Richard Bentley, New Burlington Street, Publisher in Ordinary to Her Majesty, 1860 |accessdate=17 August 2012|year=1860}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\nEarly in his reign, Henry hosted the visit of [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], the only [[Byzantine emperor]] ever to visit England, from December 1400 to January 1401 at [[Eltham Palace]], with a [[joust]] being given in his honour. Henry also sent monetary support with Manuel upon his departure to aid him against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>G. Dennis, ''The Letters of Manuel II Palaeologus'' (Washington DC, 1977) Letter 38.</ref>\n\nIn 1406, English pirates captured the future [[James I of Scotland]], aged eleven, off the coast of [[Flamborough Head]] as he was sailing to France.<ref>E W M Balfour-Melville, ''James I King of Scots'', London 1936</ref> James was delivered to Henry IV and remained a prisoner for the rest of Henry's reign.\n\n===Final illness and death===\nThe later years of Henry's reign were marked by serious health problems. He had a disfiguring skin disease and, more seriously, suffered acute attacks of some grave illness in June 1405; April 1406; June 1408; during the winter of 1408\u201309; December 1412; and finally a fatal bout in March 1413. In 1410, Henry had provided his royal surgeon [[Thomas Morstede]] with an annuity of \u00a340 p.a. which was confirmed by Henry V immediately after his succession. This was so that Morstede would 'not be retained by anyone else'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cutting Edge: Early History of the Surgeons of London|last=Beck|first=Theodore|publisher=Lund Humphries Publishers Ltd|year=1974|isbn=978-0853313663|location=|pages=57}}</ref> Medical historians have long debated the nature of this affliction or afflictions. The skin disease might have been [[leprosy]] (which did not necessarily mean precisely the same thing in the 15th century as it does to modern medicine), perhaps [[psoriasis]], or some other disease. The acute attacks have been given a wide range of explanations, from [[epilepsy]] to some form of cardiovascular disease.<ref>Peter McNiven, \"The Problem of Henry IV's Health, 1405\u20131413\", ''English Historical Review'', 100 (1985), pp. 747\u2013772</ref> Some medieval writers felt that he was struck with leprosy as a punishment for his treatment of [[Richard Scrope (cleric)|Richard le Scrope]], [[Archbishop of York]], who was executed in June 1405 on Henry's orders after a failed coup.<ref>Swanson ''Religion and Devotion'' p. 298</ref> \n\nAccording to [[Holinshed]], it was predicted that Henry would die in Jerusalem, and [[Henry IV, part 2|Shakespeare's play]] repeats this prophecy. Henry took this to mean that he would die on [[crusade]]. In reality, he died in the [[Jerusalem Chamber]] in the abbot's house of Westminster Abbey, on 20 March 1413 during a [[Legislative session|convocation of Parliament]].{{sfn|Brown|Summerson|2010}}  His [[executor]], [[Thomas Langley]], was at his side.\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral 26.jpg|thumb|left|Henry IV and Joan of Navarre, detail of their effigies in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:King Henry IV from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|upright|16th-century imaginary painting of Henry IV, [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]\nDespite the example set by most of his recent predecessors, Henry and his second wife, [[Joan of Navarre, Queen of England]], were buried not at Westminster Abbey but at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], on the north side of Trinity Chapel and directly adjacent to the shrine of St [[Thomas Becket]]. Becket's cult was then still thriving, as evidenced in the monastic accounts and in literary works such as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and Henry seemed particularly devoted to it, or at least keen to be associated with it. Reasons for his interment in Canterbury are debatable, but it is highly likely that Henry deliberately associated himself with the martyr saint for reasons of political expediency, namely, the legitimisation of his dynasty after seizing the throne from Richard II.<ref>Christopher Wilson, 'The Tomb of Henry IV and the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury', in ''Medieval Architecture and its Intellectual Context'', ed.

The wooden panel at the western end of his tomb bears a painting of the martyrdom of Becket, and the tester, or wooden canopy, above the tomb is painted with Henry's personal motto, 'Soverayne', alternated by crowned golden eagles. Likewise, the three large coats of arms that dominate the tester painting are surrounded by collars of SS, a golden eagle enclosed in each tiret.<ref>Christopher Wilson, 'The Tomb of Henry IV and the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury', in ''Medieval Architecture and its Intellectual Context'', ed.

That entailment clearly reflects the operation of [[agnatic primogeniture]], also known as the [[Salic law]]. At this time, it was by no means a settled custom for the daughter of a king to supersede the brothers of that king in the line of succession to the throne. Indeed, it was not an established belief that women could inherit the throne at all by right: the only previous instance of succession passing through a woman had been that which involved the [[Empress Matilda]], and this had involved protracted civil war, with the other protagonist being the son of Matilda's father's sister (not his brother). Yet, the heir of the royal estate according to common law (by which the houses and tenancies of common people like peasants and tradesmen passed) was [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], who descended from the daughter of Edward III's third son (second to survive to adulthood), [[Lionel of Antwerp]]. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son and the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas Edmund's descent was through his grandmother.\n\nThe official account of events claims that Richard voluntarily agreed to resign his crown to Henry on 29 September. The country had rallied behind Henry and supported his claim in parliament. However, the question of the succession never went away. The problem lay in the fact that Henry was only the most prominent male heir, but not the most senior in terms of agnatic descent from Edward III. Although he was heir to the throne according to Edward III's entail to the crown of 1376,<ref>{{cite book|last=Given-Wilson|first=Chris|title=Building Legitimacy: Political Discourses and Forms of Legitimacy in Medieval Societies|editor=Alfonso Ant\u00f3n,  Isabel |publisher=Brill|location=Boston, MA|year=2004|page=90|isbn=90-04-13305-4}}</ref> Dr. [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]] has pointed out in his 2008 biography of Henry IV that this entail had probably been supplanted by an entail made by Richard II in 1399 (see Ian Mortimer, ''The Fears of Henry IV'', appendix two, pp.&nbsp;366\u2013369). Henry thus had to overcome the superior claim of the Mortimers in order to maintain his inheritance. This difficulty compounded when the Mortimer claim was merged with the Yorkist claim in the person of Richard, 3rd Duke of York. The Duke of York was the [[heir-general]] of Edward III, and the heir presumptive (due to agnatic descent, the same principle by which Henry IV claimed the throne in 1399) of Henry's grandson Henry VI (since Henry IV's other sons did not have male heirs, and the legitimated Beauforts were excluded from the throne). The House of Lancaster was finally deposed by Edward IV, son of the 3rd Duke of York, during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nHenry avoided the problem of Mortimer having a superior claim by ignoring his own descent from Edward III. He claimed the throne as the rightful heir to King Henry III by claiming that [[Edmund Crouchback]] was the elder and not the younger son of Henry III. He asserted that every monarch from Edward I was a usurper, and he, as his mother Blanche of Lancaster was a great-granddaughter of Edmund, was the rightful king. Henry IV also claimed to be king of France, but Henry III had no claim to that throne.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ashdown-Hill |first1=John |title=The Lancastrian Claim to the Throne |journal=The Ricardian |date=2003 |volume=XIII |pages=27\u201338 |url=http://www.thericardian.online/the_ricardian.php |accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n| collapsed=yes |align=center |ref={{sfn|Watson|1896|p=114}}\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.

The attribution of the name Edward to this boy is conjecture based on the fact that Henry was the grandson of Edward III and idolised his uncle Edward of Woodstock yet did not call any of his sons Edward.

Henry was involved in the revolt of the [[Lords Appellant]] against Richard in 1388. He was later exiled by the king. After John of Gaunt died in 1399, the king did not allow Henry to inherit Gaunt's duchy. That year, Henry rallied a group of supporters, overthrew and imprisoned Richard II, and took the throne. \n\nAs king, Henry had to deal with rumours that Richard II, who had died in 1400, was still alive. He also faced a number of rebellions. [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], the self-proclaimed [[List of rulers of Wales|ruler of Wales]], [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|revolted]] against the king. Henry IV defeated [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403. The king had poor health in the latter part of his reign. Upon his death in 1413, he was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].\n\n==Siblings==\nHenry's elder sisters were [[Philippa, Queen of Portugal]], and [[Elizabeth of Lancaster, Duchess of Exeter]]. His younger half-sister, the daughter of his father's second wife, [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]], was [[Katherine, Queen of Castile]]. He also had four natural half-siblings born of [[Katherine Swynford]], originally his sisters' governess, then his father's longstanding mistress and later third wife. These illegitimate children were given the surname [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] from their birthplace at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Beaufort]] in [[Champagne, France]].<ref name=\"Armitage-Smith\">{{cite book| last=Armitage-Smith |first=Sydney |title=John of Gaunt |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aUutJGyx5EEC&pg=PA318 |year=1905 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |page=318}}<!-- |accessdate=17 July 2018--></ref>\n\nHenry's relationship with his stepmother, Katherine Swynford, was a positive one, but his relationship with the Beauforts varied. In youth he seems to have been close to all of them, but rivalries with [[Henry Beaufort|Henry]] and [[Thomas Beaufort]] proved problematic after 1406. [[Ralph Neville, 4th Baron Neville]], married Henry's half-sister [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]]. Neville remained one of his strongest supporters, and so did his eldest half-brother [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]], even though Henry revoked [[Richard II]]'s grant to John of a [[marquess]]ate. Thomas Swynford, a son from Katherine's first marriage, was another loyal companion. Thomas was Constable of [[Pontefract Castle]], where Richard II is said to have died.\n\nHenry's half-sister Joan was the mother of [[Cecily Neville]]. Cecily married [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York]], and had several offspring, including [[Edward IV]] and [[Richard III]], making Joan the grandmother of two [[Yorkist]] kings of England.\n\n==Relationship with Richard II==\n[[File:HenryBolingbrokeClaimsThrone.jpg|thumb|300px|Henry of Bolingbroke, flanked by the lords spiritual and temporal, claims the throne in 1399.

In fact, Richard elevated Henry from [[Earl of Derby]] to [[Duke of Hereford]].\n\nHenry spent the full year of 1390 supporting the unsuccessful siege of [[Vilnius]] (capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]) by [[Teutonic Knights]] with 70 to 80 household knights.{{sfn|Given-Wilson|2016|pp=66\u201368}} During this campaign he bought captured [[Lithuania]]n women and children and took them back to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] to be converted.{{sfn|Given-Wilson|2016|p=69}} Henry's second expedition to Lithuania in 1392 illustrates the financial benefits to the Order of these guest crusaders. His small army consisted of over 100 men, including [[longbow]] archers and six minstrels, at a total cost to the Lancastrian purse of \u00a34,360. Despite the efforts of Henry and his English crusaders, two years of attacks on Vilnius proved fruitless. In 1392\u201393 Henry undertook a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], where he made offerings at the [[Holy Sepulchre]] and at the [[Mount of Olives]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bevan|first=Bryan|title=Henry IV|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1994|page=[https://books.google.be/books?id=wsjq_H5uCagC&pg=PA32 32]|isbn=0-948695-35-8}}</ref> Later he vowed to lead a crusade to 'free Jerusalem from the infidel,' but he died before this could be accomplished.<ref>B.

With Arundel as his advisor, Henry began a military campaign, confiscating land from those who opposed him and ordering his soldiers to destroy much of [[Cheshire]]. Henry initially announced that his intention was  to reclaim his rights as [[Duke of Lancaster]], though he quickly gained enough power and support to have himself declared King Henry IV, imprison King Richard (who died in prison under mysterious circumstances) and bypass Richard's 7-year-old [[heir-presumptive]], [[Edmund de Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]].<ref name=\"Bevan 1994 66\">B.

From a 15th-century manuscript of [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''[[Froissart's Chronicles|Chronicles]]''.]]\n\n===The previous ruler===\nHenry's first major problem as monarch was what to do with the deposed Richard. After an early [[Epiphany Rising|assassination plot]] was foiled in January 1400, Richard died in prison aged 33, probably of starvation. Though Henry is often suspected of having his predecessor murdered, there is no substantial evidence to prove that claim. Some chroniclers claimed that the despondent Richard had starved himself,<ref name=tuck>Anthony Tuck, 'Richard II (1367\u20131400)', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref> which would not have been out of place with what is known of Richard's character. Though council records indicate that provisions were made for the transportation of the deposed king's body as early as 17 February, there is no reason to believe that he did not die on 14 February, as several chronicles stated. It can be positively said that he did not suffer a violent death, for his skeleton, upon examination, bore no signs of violence; whether he did indeed starve himself or whether that starvation was forced upon him are matters for lively historical speculation.<ref name=tuck/>\n[[File:Silver half groat of Henry IV (YORYM 1994 151 102) obverse.jpg|thumb|left|Silver half groat of Henry IV, York Museums Trust]]\nAfter his death, Richard's body was put on public display in the [[old St Paul's Cathedral]], both to prove to his supporters that he was truly dead and also to prove that he had not suffered a violent death. This did not stop rumours from circulating for years after that he was still alive and waiting to take back his throne. Henry had Richard discreetly buried in the [[King's Langley Priory|Dominican Priory]] at [[Kings Langley]], [[Hertfordshire]], where he remained until King Henry V brought his body back to London and buried him in the tomb that Richard had commissioned for himself in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Joel Burden, 'How Do You Bury a Deposed King?', in Henry IV: The Establishment of the Regime, 1399\u20131406, ed. Gwilym Dodd and Douglas Biggs (York: York Medieval Press, 2003), pp. 35\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Rebellions===\n{{House of Lancaster|henry4}}\nHenry spent much of his reign defending himself against plots, rebellions and assassination attempts. Rebellions continued throughout the first 10 years of Henry's reign, including the [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|revolt]] of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], who declared himself [[Prince of Wales]] in 1400, and the rebellions led by [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], from 1402. The rebellions of Henry Percy advanced into the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403. After this battle, Henry IV's son, [[Henry of Monmouth]] (later king), was left with an arrow penetrated in the left hand side of his face under his eye. He was cared for by the royal physician [[John Bradmore]]. Despite this, the Battle of Shrewsbury was left in a royalist victory. The king's success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son, Monmouth (though Monmouth managed to seize much effective power from his father in 1410).\n\nIn the last year of Henry's reign, the rebellions picked up speed. \"The old fable of a living Richard was revived\", notes one account, \"and emissaries from Scotland traversed the villages of England, in the last year of Henry's reign, declaring that Richard was residing at the Scottish Court, awaiting only a signal from his friends to repair to London and recover his throne.\"\n\nA suitable-looking impostor was found and King Richard's old groom circulated word in the city that his master was alive in Scotland. \"Southwark was incited to insurrection\" by Sir Elias Lyvet ([[Levett]]) and his associate Thomas Clark, who promised Scottish aid in carrying out the insurrection. Ultimately, the rebellion came to naught. Lyvet was released and Clark thrown into the Tower.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oqMuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=lyvet+king#PPA233,M1 |title=The Book of the Princes of Wales, Heirs to the Crown of England, Dr. John Doran, London, Richard Bentley, New Burlington Street, Publisher in Ordinary to Her Majesty, 1860 |accessdate=17 August 2012|year=1860}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\nEarly in his reign, Henry hosted the visit of [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], the only [[Byzantine emperor]] ever to visit England, from December 1400 to January 1401 at [[Eltham Palace]], with a [[joust]] being given in his honour. Henry also sent monetary support with Manuel upon his departure to aid him against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>G. Dennis, ''The Letters of Manuel II Palaeologus'' (Washington DC, 1977) Letter 38.</ref>\n\nIn 1406, English pirates captured the future [[James I of Scotland]], aged eleven, off the coast of [[Flamborough Head]] as he was sailing to France.<ref>E W M Balfour-Melville, ''James I King of Scots'', London 1936</ref> James was delivered to Henry IV and remained a prisoner for the rest of Henry's reign.\n\n===Final illness and death===\nThe later years of Henry's reign were marked by serious health problems. He had a disfiguring skin disease and, more seriously, suffered acute attacks of some grave illness in June 1405; April 1406; June 1408; during the winter of 1408\u201309; December 1412; and finally a fatal bout in March 1413. In 1410, Henry had provided his royal surgeon [[Thomas Morstede]] with an annuity of \u00a340 p.a. which was confirmed by Henry V immediately after his succession. This was so that Morstede would 'not be retained by anyone else'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cutting Edge: Early History of the Surgeons of London|last=Beck|first=Theodore|publisher=Lund Humphries Publishers Ltd|year=1974|isbn=978-0853313663|location=|pages=57}}</ref> Medical historians have long debated the nature of this affliction or afflictions. The skin disease might have been [[leprosy]] (which did not necessarily mean precisely the same thing in the 15th century as it does to modern medicine), perhaps [[psoriasis]], or some other disease. The acute attacks have been given a wide range of explanations, from [[epilepsy]] to some form of cardiovascular disease.<ref>Peter McNiven, \"The Problem of Henry IV's Health, 1405\u20131413\", ''English Historical Review'', 100 (1985), pp. 747\u2013772</ref> Some medieval writers felt that he was struck with leprosy as a punishment for his treatment of [[Richard Scrope (cleric)|Richard le Scrope]], [[Archbishop of York]], who was executed in June 1405 on Henry's orders after a failed coup.<ref>Swanson ''Religion and Devotion'' p. 298</ref> \n\nAccording to [[Holinshed]], it was predicted that Henry would die in Jerusalem, and [[Henry IV, part 2|Shakespeare's play]] repeats this prophecy. Henry took this to mean that he would die on [[crusade]]. In reality, he died in the [[Jerusalem Chamber]] in the abbot's house of Westminster Abbey, on 20 March 1413 during a [[Legislative session|convocation of Parliament]].{{sfn|Brown|Summerson|2010}}  His [[executor]], [[Thomas Langley]], was at his side.\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral 26.jpg|thumb|left|Henry IV and Joan of Navarre, detail of their effigies in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:King Henry IV from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|upright|16th-century imaginary painting of Henry IV, [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]\nDespite the example set by most of his recent predecessors, Henry and his second wife, [[Joan of Navarre, Queen of England]], were buried not at Westminster Abbey but at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], on the north side of Trinity Chapel and directly adjacent to the shrine of St [[Thomas Becket]]. Becket's cult was then still thriving, as evidenced in the monastic accounts and in literary works such as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and Henry seemed particularly devoted to it, or at least keen to be associated with it. Reasons for his interment in Canterbury are debatable, but it is highly likely that Henry deliberately associated himself with the martyr saint for reasons of political expediency, namely, the legitimisation of his dynasty after seizing the throne from Richard II.<ref>Christopher Wilson, 'The Tomb of Henry IV and the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury', in ''Medieval Architecture and its Intellectual Context'', ed.

The wooden panel at the western end of his tomb bears a painting of the martyrdom of Becket, and the tester, or wooden canopy, above the tomb is painted with Henry's personal motto, 'Soverayne', alternated by crowned golden eagles. Likewise, the three large coats of arms that dominate the tester painting are surrounded by collars of SS, a golden eagle enclosed in each tiret.<ref>Christopher Wilson, 'The Tomb of Henry IV and the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury', in ''Medieval Architecture and its Intellectual Context'', ed.

That entailment clearly reflects the operation of [[agnatic primogeniture]], also known as the [[Salic law]]. At this time, it was by no means a settled custom for the daughter of a king to supersede the brothers of that king in the line of succession to the throne. Indeed, it was not an established belief that women could inherit the throne at all by right: the only previous instance of succession passing through a woman had been that which involved the [[Empress Matilda]], and this had involved protracted civil war, with the other protagonist being the son of Matilda's father's sister (not his brother). Yet, the heir of the royal estate according to common law (by which the houses and tenancies of common people like peasants and tradesmen passed) was [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], who descended from the daughter of Edward III's third son (second to survive to adulthood), [[Lionel of Antwerp]]. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son and the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas Edmund's descent was through his grandmother.\n\nThe official account of events claims that Richard voluntarily agreed to resign his crown to Henry on 29 September. The country had rallied behind Henry and supported his claim in parliament. However, the question of the succession never went away. The problem lay in the fact that Henry was only the most prominent male heir, but not the most senior in terms of agnatic descent from Edward III. Although he was heir to the throne according to Edward III's entail to the crown of 1376,<ref>{{cite book|last=Given-Wilson|first=Chris|title=Building Legitimacy: Political Discourses and Forms of Legitimacy in Medieval Societies|editor=Alfonso Ant\u00f3n,  Isabel |publisher=Brill|location=Boston, MA|year=2004|page=90|isbn=90-04-13305-4}}</ref> Dr. [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]] has pointed out in his 2008 biography of Henry IV that this entail had probably been supplanted by an entail made by Richard II in 1399 (see Ian Mortimer, ''The Fears of Henry IV'', appendix two, pp.&nbsp;366\u2013369). Henry thus had to overcome the superior claim of the Mortimers in order to maintain his inheritance. This difficulty compounded when the Mortimer claim was merged with the Yorkist claim in the person of Richard, 3rd Duke of York. The Duke of York was the [[heir-general]] of Edward III, and the heir presumptive (due to agnatic descent, the same principle by which Henry IV claimed the throne in 1399) of Henry's grandson Henry VI (since Henry IV's other sons did not have male heirs, and the legitimated Beauforts were excluded from the throne). The House of Lancaster was finally deposed by Edward IV, son of the 3rd Duke of York, during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nHenry avoided the problem of Mortimer having a superior claim by ignoring his own descent from Edward III. He claimed the throne as the rightful heir to King Henry III by claiming that [[Edmund Crouchback]] was the elder and not the younger son of Henry III. He asserted that every monarch from Edward I was a usurper, and he, as his mother Blanche of Lancaster was a great-granddaughter of Edmund, was the rightful king. Henry IV also claimed to be king of France, but Henry III had no claim to that throne.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ashdown-Hill |first1=John |title=The Lancastrian Claim to the Throne |journal=The Ricardian |date=2003 |volume=XIII |pages=27\u201338 |url=http://www.thericardian.online/the_ricardian.php |accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n| collapsed=yes |align=center |ref={{sfn|Watson|1896|p=114}}\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.

The attribution of the name Edward to this boy is conjecture based on the fact that Henry was the grandson of Edward III and idolised his uncle Edward of Woodstock yet did not call any of his sons Edward.
