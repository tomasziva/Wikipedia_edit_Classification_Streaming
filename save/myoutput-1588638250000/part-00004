The population was 47,573 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], which makes it the 20th largest city in Ohio.\n\nIt is the site of much of the [[Newark Earthworks]], a major ancient complex built by the [[Hopewell culture]]. The Great Circle portion and additional burial mounds are located in the neighboring city of [[Heath, Ohio]]. This complex has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Newark Earthworks mound 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Newark Earthworks]] mound, [[Hopewell culture]], 100 AD-500 AD]]\nCultures of [[indigenous peoples]] lived along the river valleys for thousands of years before [[Europe]]an contact.  From more than two thousand years ago, 100 AD to 500 AD, people of the [[Hopewell culture]] transformed the area of Newark and Heath.  They built many [[Mound builder (people)|earthen mounds]] and [[enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]]s, creating the single largest [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] complex in the [[Ohio River Valley]].  The [[Newark Earthworks]], designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], have been preserved to document and interpret the area's significant ancient history.  The earthworks cover several square miles and about 206 acres. This is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].<ref name=OhioHistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=History|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Observatory Mound, Observatory Circle, and the interconnected Octagon earthworks span nearly {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in length. The Octagon alone is large enough to contain four Roman [[Colosseum|Coliseums]].  The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] would fit precisely within Observatory Circle. The even larger {{convert|1180|ft|m|adj=on}}-diameter Newark Great Circle, located in Heath, is the largest circular earthwork in the [[Americas]].  The {{convert|8|ft|m}}-high walls surround a {{convert|5|ft|m}}-deep moat.  At the entrance, the walls and moat are of greater and more impressive dimensions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nContemporary [[Geodesy|archaeogeodesy]] and [[archaeoastronomy]] researchers have demonstrated that the Hopewell and other [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[culture]]s had advanced scientific understandings which they used to create their earthworks for [[astronomical]] observations, markings and celebrations.  Researchers analyzed the placements, alignments, dimensions, and site-to-site interrelationships of the Hopewell earthworks to understand what had been done.  Today, the Ohio Historical Society preserves the Great Circle Earthworks in a public park near downtown Newark, called Mound Builders Park (or the [[Newark Earthworks]]) located at 99 Cooper Ave, Newark, Ohio.  The area of the Octagon Earthworks had been leased to a country club, but new arrangements in 1997 provide for more public access to it.  Later [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes inhabiting the area at the time of European contact were distant descendants of the Hopewell peoples. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===European-American settlement===\n[[File:Pennsylvania Railway Station Newark Ohio.JPG|thumb|left|Newark's Pennsylvania Railway Station]]  After exploration by traders and trappers in earlier centuries, the first European-American settlers arrived in 1802, led by Gen. [[William C. Schenck]].  He named the new village after his [[New Jersey]] hometown.\n\nNineteenth-century investment in infrastructure resulted in growth in the town after it was linked to major transportation and trade networks.  On July 4, 1825, Governors [[DeWitt Clinton|Clinton]] of New York and [[Jeremiah Morrow|Morrow]] of Ohio dug the first shovelfuls of dirt for the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] project, at the Licking Summit near Newark, Ohio.  On April 11, 1855, Newark became a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]] that was built to connect [[Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis]].  On April 16, 1857, the [[Central Ohio Railroad]] connected Newark west to [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and later Newark maintained a station on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].\n\nThe [[Heisey Glass Company]] started in Newark in 1895. The factory operated there for 62 years, until the company's demise in 1957 due to changing tastes. The National Heisey Glass Museum, operated by the Heisey Collectors of America, Inc., is located on Sixth Street in Newark.\n\nIn 1909, The Arcade was opened.  Modeled after innovative European retail buildings, it became one of Newark's first successful retail emporiums.  Later versions of buildings that contained a variety of shops indoors became known as shopping malls.  At {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}}, the Arcade is one-third the size of an average modern [[Wal-Mart]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|20.88|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref> Newark is located at {{coord|40|3|47|N|82|25|0|W|type:city}} (40.063014, &minus;82.416779).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 232\n|1820= 410\n|1830= 999\n|1840= 2705\n|1850= 3654\n|1860= 4675\n|1870= 6698\n|1880= 9600\n|1890= 14270\n|1900= 18157\n|1910= 25404\n|1920= 26718\n|1930= 30596\n|1940= 31487\n|1950= 34275\n|1960= 41790\n|1970= 41836\n|1980= 41162\n|1990= 44389\n|2000= 46279\n|2010= 47573\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=50029\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1960/population-volume-1/37749282v1p37_ch02.pdf|date=1960|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn terms of population, Newark, Ohio is the second-largest Newark in the United States, after [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]].

of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], at the junction of the forks of the [[Licking River (Ohio)|Licking River]]. The population was 47,573 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], which makes it the 20th largest city in Ohio.\n\nIt is the site of much of the [[Newark Earthworks]], a major ancient complex built by the [[Hopewell culture]]. The Great Circle portion and additional burial mounds are located in the neighboring city of [[Heath, Ohio]]. This complex has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Newark Earthworks mound 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Newark Earthworks]] mound, [[Hopewell culture]], 100 AD-500 AD]]\nCultures of [[indigenous peoples]] lived along the river valleys for thousands of years before [[Europe]]an contact.  From more than two thousand years ago, 100 AD to 500 AD, people of the [[Hopewell culture]] transformed the area of Newark and Heath.  They built many [[Mound builder (people)|earthen mounds]] and [[enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]]s, creating the single largest [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] complex in the [[Ohio River Valley]].  The [[Newark Earthworks]], designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], have been preserved to document and interpret the area's significant ancient history.  The earthworks cover several square miles and about 206 acres. This is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].<ref name=OhioHistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=History|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Observatory Mound, Observatory Circle, and the interconnected Octagon earthworks span nearly {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in length. The Octagon alone is large enough to contain four Roman [[Colosseum|Coliseums]].  The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] would fit precisely within Observatory Circle. The even larger {{convert|1180|ft|m|adj=on}}-diameter Newark Great Circle, located in Heath, is the largest circular earthwork in the [[Americas]].  The {{convert|8|ft|m}}-high walls surround a {{convert|5|ft|m}}-deep moat.  At the entrance, the walls and moat are of greater and more impressive dimensions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nContemporary [[Geodesy|archaeogeodesy]] and [[archaeoastronomy]] researchers have demonstrated that the Hopewell and other [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[culture]]s had advanced scientific understandings which they used to create their earthworks for [[astronomical]] observations, markings and celebrations.  Researchers analyzed the placements, alignments, dimensions, and site-to-site interrelationships of the Hopewell earthworks to understand what had been done.  Today, the Ohio Historical Society preserves the Great Circle Earthworks in a public park near downtown Newark, called Mound Builders Park (or the [[Newark Earthworks]]) located at 99 Cooper Ave, Newark, Ohio.  The area of the Octagon Earthworks had been leased to a country club, but new arrangements in 1997 provide for more public access to it.  Later [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes inhabiting the area at the time of European contact were distant descendants of the Hopewell peoples. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===European-American settlement===\n[[File:Pennsylvania Railway Station Newark Ohio.JPG|thumb|left|Newark's Pennsylvania Railway Station]]  After exploration by traders and trappers in earlier centuries, the first European-American settlers arrived in 1802, led by Gen. [[William C. Schenck]].  He named the new village after his [[New Jersey]] hometown.\n\nNineteenth-century investment in infrastructure resulted in growth in the town after it was linked to major transportation and trade networks.  On July 4, 1825, Governors [[DeWitt Clinton|Clinton]] of New York and [[Jeremiah Morrow|Morrow]] of Ohio dug the first shovelfuls of dirt for the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] project, at the Licking Summit near Newark, Ohio.  On April 11, 1855, Newark became a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]] that was built to connect [[Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis]].  On April 16, 1857, the [[Central Ohio Railroad]] connected Newark west to [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and later Newark maintained a station on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].\n\nThe [[Heisey Glass Company]] started in Newark in 1895. The factory operated there for 62 years, until the company's demise in 1957 due to changing tastes. The National Heisey Glass Museum, operated by the Heisey Collectors of America, Inc., is located on Sixth Street in Newark.\n\nIn 1909, The Arcade was opened.  Modeled after innovative European retail buildings, it became one of Newark's first successful retail emporiums.  Later versions of buildings that contained a variety of shops indoors became known as shopping malls.  At {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}}, the Arcade is one-third the size of an average modern [[Wal-Mart]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|20.88|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref> Newark is located at {{coord|40|3|47|N|82|25|0|W|type:city}} (40.063014, &minus;82.416779).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 232\n|1820= 410\n|1830= 999\n|1840= 2705\n|1850= 3654\n|1860= 4675\n|1870= 6698\n|1880= 9600\n|1890= 14270\n|1900= 18157\n|1910= 25404\n|1920= 26718\n|1930= 30596\n|1940= 31487\n|1950= 34275\n|1960= 41790\n|1970= 41836\n|1980= 41162\n|1990= 44389\n|2000= 46279\n|2010= 47573\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=50029\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1960/population-volume-1/37749282v1p37_ch02.pdf|date=1960|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn terms of population, Newark, Ohio is the second-largest Newark in the United States, after [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]].
