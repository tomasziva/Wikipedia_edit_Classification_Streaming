The physics of continuous quantum measurements is as follows. Consider using an ancilla, e.g. a [[Cavity quantum electrodynamics|field]] or a [[Circuit quantum electrodynamics|current]], to probe a quantum system. The interaction between the system and the probe correlates the two systems. Typically the interaction only weakly correlates the system and ancilla. (Specifically, the interaction unitary need only to be expanded to first or second order in perturbation theory.) By measuring the ancilla and then using quantum measurement theory, the state of the system conditioned on the results of the measurement can be determined. In order to obtain a strong measurement, many ancilla must be coupled and then measured. In the limit where there is a continuum of ancilla the measurement process becomes continuous in time.

One approach is to declare a weak measurement to be a generalized measurement where some or all of the [[Kraus operators]] are close to the identity.<ref name=\"OreshkovBrun2005\" /> The approach taken below is to interact two systems weakly and then measure one of them.<ref name=\"Wiseman and Milburn\"/> After detailing this approach we will illustrate it with examples.\n\n===Weak interaction and ancilla coupled measurement===\n\nConsider a system that starts in the [[quantum state]] <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> and an ancilla that starts in the state <math>|\\phi\\rangle</math>, the combined initial state is <math>|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle</math>. These two systems interact via the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] <math>H = A \\otimes B</math>, which generates the time evolutions <math>U(t) = \\exp[-ixtH] </math> (in units where <math>\\hbar = 1</math>), where <math>x</math> is the \"interaction strength\", which has units of inverse time. Assume a fixed interaction time <math>t = \\Delta t</math> and that <math>\\lambda = x \\Delta t</math> is small, such that <math>\\lambda^3 \\approx 0</math>. A series expansion of <math>U</math> in  <math>\\lambda</math> gives\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n U &= I \\otimes I - i\\lambda H - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 H^2 + O(\\lambda^3) \\\\\n  &\\approx I \\otimes I - i\\lambda A \\otimes B - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\otimes B^2.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nBecause it was only necessary to expand the unitary to a low order in perturbation theory, we call this is a weak interaction. Further, the fact that the unitary is predominately the identity operator, as <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\lambda^2</math> are small, implies that the state after the interaction is not radically different from the initial state. The combined state of the system after interaction is\n\n:<math>\n|\\Psi'\\rangle = \\left(I \\otimes I - i\\lambda A \\otimes B - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\otimes B^2\\right) |\\Psi\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nNow we perform a measurement on the ancilla to find out about the system, this is known as an ancilla-coupled measurement. We will consider measurements in a basis <math>|q\\rangle</math> (on the ancilla system) such that <math>\\sum_q |q\\rangle \\langle q| = I</math>. The measurements action on both systems is described by the action of the projectors <math>\\Pi_q = I \\otimes |q\\rangle \\langle q|</math> on the joint state <math>|\\Psi'\\rangle</math>. From [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement theory]] we know the conditional state after the measurement is\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n |\\Psi_q\\rangle &= \\frac{\\Pi_q |\\Psi'\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle\\Psi'| \\Pi_q |\\Psi'\\rangle}} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{I \\langle q|\\phi\\rangle - i\\lambda A \\langle q| B |\\phi\\rangle - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\langle q| B^2 |\\phi\\rangle}{\\mathcal N} |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |q\\rangle,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathcal N = \\sqrt{\\langle\\Psi'| \\Pi_q |\\Psi'\\rangle}</math> is a normalization factor for the wavefunction. Notice the ancilla system state records the outcome of the measurement. The object <math>M_q := I \\langle q|\\phi\\rangle - i\\lambda A \\langle q| B |\\phi\\rangle - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\langle q| B^2 |\\phi\\rangle</math> is an operator on the system Hilbert space and is called a [[Kraus operators|Kraus operator]].\n\nWith respect to the Kraus operators the post-measurement state of the combined system is\n\n:<math>\n|\\Psi_q\\rangle = \\frac{M_q |\\psi\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle \\psi|M_q^\\dagger M_q|\\psi\\rangle}} \\otimes |q\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nThe objects <math>E_q = M_q^\\dagger M_q </math> are elements of what is called a [[POVM]] and must obey <math>\\sum_q E_q = I</math> so that the corresponding probabilities sum to unity: <math>\\sum_q \\Pr(q|\\psi) = \\sum_q \\langle\\psi| E_q |\\psi\\rangle = 1</math>. As the ancilla system is no longer correlated with the primary system, it is simply recording the outcome of the measurement, we can [[Partial trace|trace]] over it. Doing so gives the conditional state of the primary system alone:\n\n:<math>\n|\\psi_q\\rangle = \\frac{M_q |\\psi\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle \\psi|M_q^\\dagger M_q|\\psi\\rangle}},\n</math>\n\nwhich we still label by the outcome of the measurement <math>q</math>. Indeed, these considerations allow one to derive a [[Quantum stochastic calculus#Quantum trajectories|quantum trajectory]].\n\n===Example Kraus operators===\nWe will use the canonical example of Gaussian Kraus operators given by Barchielli, Lanz, Prosperi;<ref name=\"Barchiellietal1982\"/> and Caves and Milburn.<ref name=\"CavesMilburn1987\" /> Take <math>H = x \\otimes p</math>, where the position and momentum on both systems have the usual [[Canonical commutation relation]] <math>[x,  p] = i</math>. Take the initial wavefunction of the ancilla to have a Gaussian distribution\n\n:<math>\n|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\int dq' \\exp[-q'^2/(4\\sigma^2)] |q'\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nThe position wavefunction of the ancilla is\n\n:<math>\n\\Phi(q) = \\langle q|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\exp[-q^2/(4\\sigma^2)].\n</math>\n\nThe Kraus operators are (compared to the discussion above, we set <math>\\lambda = 1</math>)\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n M(q) &= \\langle q| \\exp[-ix \\otimes p] |\\Phi\\rangle \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\exp[-(q - x)^2/(4\\sigma^2)],\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhile the corresponding POVM elements are\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n E(q) &= M_q^\\dagger M_q \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp[-(q - x)^2/(2\\sigma^2)],\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhich obey <math>\\int dq\\, E(q) = I</math>. An alternative representation is often seen in the literature. Using the spectral representation of the position operator <math>x = \\int x'dx' |x'\\rangle \\langle x'|</math>, we can write\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n M(q) &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\int dx' \\exp[-(q - x')^2/(4\\sigma^2)] |x'\\rangle \\langle x'|, \\\\\n E(q) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\int dx' \\exp[-(q - x')^2/(2\\sigma^2)] |x'\\rangle \\langle x'|.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNotice that <math>\\lim_{\\sigma \\to 0} E(q) = |x = q\\rangle \\langle x = q| </math>.<ref name=\"CavesMilburn1987\" /> That is, in a particular limit these operators limit to a strong measurement of position; for other values of <math>\\sigma</math> we refer to the measurement as finite-strength; and as <math>\\sigma \\to \\infty</math>, we say the measurement is weak.\n\n==Information-gain\u2013disturbance tradeoff==\nAs stated above, Busch's theorem<ref name=\"Busch2009\" /> prevents a free lunch: there can be no information gain without disturbance. However, the tradeoff between information gain and disturbance has been characterized by many authors, including Fuchs and [[Asher Peres|Peres]];<ref name=\"FuchsPeres1996\">{{cite journal\n | author1 = C.

The physics of continuous quantum measurements is as follows. Consider using an ancilla, e.g. a [[Cavity quantum electrodynamics|field]] or a [[Circuit quantum electrodynamics|current]], to probe a quantum system. The interaction between the system and the probe correlates the two systems. Typically the interaction only weakly correlates the system and ancilla. (Specifically, the interaction unitary need only to be expanded to first or second order in perturbation theory.) By measuring the ancilla and then using quantum measurement theory, the state of the system conditioned on the results of the measurement can be determined. In order to obtain a strong measurement, many ancilla must be coupled and then measured. In the limit where there is a continuum of ancilla the measurement process becomes continuous in time.

One approach is to declare a weak measurement to be a generalized measurement where some or all of the [[Kraus operators]] are close to the identity.<ref name=\"OreshkovBrun2005\" /> The approach taken below is to interact two systems weakly and then measure one of them.<ref name=\"Wiseman and Milburn\"/> After detailing this approach we will illustrate it with examples.\n\n===Weak interaction and ancilla coupled measurement===\n\nConsider a system that starts in the [[quantum state]] <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> and an ancilla that starts in the state <math>|\\phi\\rangle</math>, the combined initial state is <math>|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle</math>. These two systems interact via the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] <math>H = A \\otimes B</math>, which generates the time evolutions <math>U(t) = \\exp[-ixtH] </math> (in units where <math>\\hbar = 1</math>), where <math>x</math> is the \"interaction strength\", which has units of inverse time. Assume a fixed interaction time <math>t = \\Delta t</math> and that <math>\\lambda = x \\Delta t</math> is small, such that <math>\\lambda^3 \\approx 0</math>. A series expansion of <math>U</math> in  <math>\\lambda</math> gives\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n U &= I \\otimes I - i\\lambda H - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 H^2 + O(\\lambda^3) \\\\\n  &\\approx I \\otimes I - i\\lambda A \\otimes B - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\otimes B^2.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nBecause it was only necessary to expand the unitary to a low order in perturbation theory, we call this is a weak interaction. Further, the fact that the unitary is predominately the identity operator, as <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\lambda^2</math> are small, implies that the state after the interaction is not radically different from the initial state. The combined state of the system after interaction is\n\n:<math>\n|\\Psi'\\rangle = \\left(I \\otimes I - i\\lambda A \\otimes B - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\otimes B^2\\right) |\\Psi\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nNow we perform a measurement on the ancilla to find out about the system, this is known as an ancilla-coupled measurement. We will consider measurements in a basis <math>|q\\rangle</math> (on the ancilla system) such that <math>\\sum_q |q\\rangle \\langle q| = I</math>. The measurements action on both systems is described by the action of the projectors <math>\\Pi_q = I \\otimes |q\\rangle \\langle q|</math> on the joint state <math>|\\Psi'\\rangle</math>. From [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement theory]] we know the conditional state after the measurement is\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n |\\Psi_q\\rangle &= \\frac{\\Pi_q |\\Psi'\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle\\Psi'| \\Pi_q |\\Psi'\\rangle}} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{I \\langle q|\\phi\\rangle - i\\lambda A \\langle q| B |\\phi\\rangle - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\langle q| B^2 |\\phi\\rangle}{\\mathcal N} |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |q\\rangle,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathcal N = \\sqrt{\\langle\\Psi'| \\Pi_q |\\Psi'\\rangle}</math> is a normalization factor for the wavefunction. Notice the ancilla system state records the outcome of the measurement. The object <math>M_q := I \\langle q|\\phi\\rangle - i\\lambda A \\langle q| B |\\phi\\rangle - \\frac 1 2 \\lambda^2 A^2 \\langle q| B^2 |\\phi\\rangle</math> is an operator on the system Hilbert space and is called a [[Kraus operators|Kraus operator]].\n\nWith respect to the Kraus operators the post-measurement state of the combined system is\n\n:<math>\n|\\Psi_q\\rangle = \\frac{M_q |\\psi\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle \\psi|M_q^\\dagger M_q|\\psi\\rangle}} \\otimes |q\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nThe objects <math>E_q = M_q^\\dagger M_q </math> are elements of what is called a [[POVM]] and must obey <math>\\sum_q E_q = I</math> so that the corresponding probabilities sum to unity: <math>\\sum_q \\Pr(q|\\psi) = \\sum_q \\langle\\psi| E_q |\\psi\\rangle = 1</math>. As the ancilla system is no longer correlated with the primary system, it is simply recording the outcome of the measurement, we can [[Partial trace|trace]] over it. Doing so gives the conditional state of the primary system alone:\n\n:<math>\n|\\psi_q\\rangle = \\frac{M_q |\\psi\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle \\psi|M_q^\\dagger M_q|\\psi\\rangle}},\n</math>\n\nwhich we still label by the outcome of the measurement <math>q</math>. Indeed, these considerations allow one to derive a [[Quantum stochastic calculus#Quantum trajectories|quantum trajectory]].\n\n===Example Kraus operators===\nWe will use the canonical example of Gaussian Kraus operators given by Barchielli, Lanz, Prosperi;<ref name=\"Barchiellietal1982\"/> and Caves and Milburn.<ref name=\"CavesMilburn1987\" /> Take <math>H = x \\otimes p</math>, where the position and momentum on both systems have the usual [[Canonical commutation relation]] <math>[x,  p] = i</math>. Take the initial wavefunction of the ancilla to have a Gaussian distribution\n\n:<math>\n|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\int dq' \\exp[-q'^2/(4\\sigma^2)] |q'\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nThe position wavefunction of the ancilla is\n\n:<math>\n\\Phi(q) = \\langle q|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\exp[-q^2/(4\\sigma^2)].\n</math>\n\nThe Kraus operators are (compared to the discussion above, we set <math>\\lambda = 1</math>)\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n M(q) &= \\langle q| \\exp[-ix \\otimes p] |\\Phi\\rangle \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\exp[-(q - x)^2/(4\\sigma^2)],\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhile the corresponding POVM elements are\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n E(q) &= M_q^\\dagger M_q \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp[-(q - x)^2/(2\\sigma^2)],\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhich obey <math>\\int dq\\, E(q) = I</math>. An alternative representation is often seen in the literature. Using the spectral representation of the position operator <math>x = \\int x'dx' |x'\\rangle \\langle x'|</math>, we can write\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n M(q) &= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\int dx' \\exp[-(q - x')^2/(4\\sigma^2)] |x'\\rangle \\langle x'|, \\\\\n E(q) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\int dx' \\exp[-(q - x')^2/(2\\sigma^2)] |x'\\rangle \\langle x'|.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNotice that <math>\\lim_{\\sigma \\to 0} E(q) = |x = q\\rangle \\langle x = q| </math>.<ref name=\"CavesMilburn1987\" /> That is, in a particular limit these operators limit to a strong measurement of position; for other values of <math>\\sigma</math> we refer to the measurement as finite-strength; and as <math>\\sigma \\to \\infty</math>, we say the measurement is weak.\n\n==Information-gain\u2013disturbance tradeoff==\nAs stated above, Busch's theorem<ref name=\"Busch2009\" /> prevents a free lunch: there can be no information gain without disturbance. However, the tradeoff between information gain and disturbance has been characterized by many authors, including Fuchs and [[Asher Peres|Peres]];<ref name=\"FuchsPeres1996\">{{cite journal\n | author1 = C.
