Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\" For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective. Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools.

On February 17, an e-mail from one participant indicated that the type of social gathering on the ''Diamond Princess'' cruise ship wasn't that different from a mall, school, or work environment. Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\" For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective. Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools.
