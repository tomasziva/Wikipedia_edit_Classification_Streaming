The political background to this new law was that Germany, for the first time ever, was acknowledged to be a destination for immigrants. The practical changes{{clarify|date=December 2014}} to immigration procedures were relatively minor. New immigration categories, such as \"highly skilled professional\" and \"scientist\" were introduced to attract valuable professionals to the German labour market. The development within German immigration law shows that immigration of skilled employees and academics has eased{{clarify|date=December 2014}} while the labour market remains closed for unskilled workers.\n\nIn April 2012, [[Blue Card (European Union)|European Blue Card]] legislation was implemented in Germany, allowing highly skilled non-EU citizens easier access to work and live in Germany, subject to certain requirements. According to the federal statistics office in 2016, over one out of five Germans has at least partial roots outside of the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2017/08/PD17_261_12511.html |title = Bev\u00f6lkerung mit Migrationshintergrund um 8,5 % gestiegen}}</ref>\n\n==History of immigration to Germany==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-01986-09083, Schwarza, kubanische Gastarbeiterin.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|A so-called \"guest worker\" (''[[Gastarbeiter]]in'') from [[Cuba]], working in an [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] factory, 1986]]\n\n===After World War II until reunification (1945-1980)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n{{see also|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection#Emigration restrictions|Turks in Germany|Vietnamese people in Germany}}\n\nTowards the end of World War II,and in its aftermath, up to 12 million refugees of [[ethnic Germans]], so-called \"[[Heimatvertriebene]]\" (German for \"expellees\", literally \"homeland displaced persons\") were forced to migrate from the former German areas, as for instance [[Silesia]] or [[East Prussia]], to the new formed States of [[Allied-occupied Germany|post-war Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria]], because of changing borderlines in Europe.<ref name=\"spo\">[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/spiegelgeschichte/d-76574305.html], SpiegelOnline 25 January 2011.</ref><ref name=\"kas\">[http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8807/ \"Konrad Adenauer Stiftung\" ], viewed on 31 March 2015.</ref>  A big wave of immigration to Germany started in the 1960s. Due to a shortage of laborers during the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (\"economic miracle\") in the 1950s and 1960s, the West German government signed bilateral recruitment agreements with [[Italy]] in 1955, [[Greece]] in 1960, [[Turkey]] in 1961, [[Morocco]] in 1963, [[Portugal]] in 1964, [[Tunisia]] in 1965 and [[Yugoslavia]] in 1968. These agreements allowed the recruitment of so-called ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (\"guest workers\") to work in the industrial sector in jobs that required few qualifications.\nChildren born to 'Gastarbeiter' received the right to reside in Germany but were not granted citizenship; this was known as the ''Aufenthaltsberechtigung'' (\"right of residence\"). Many of the descendants of those ''Gastarbeiter'' still live in Germany and many have acquired German citizenship.\n\nThe [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) recruited workers from outside its borders differently. It criticized the Gastarbeiter policy, calling it capitalist exploitation of poor foreigners, and preferred to see its foreign workers as socialist \"friends\" who traveled to the GDR from other communist or socialist countries in order to learn skills which could then be applied in their home countries. Most of these came from [[North Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Cuba]].\nFollowing [[German reunification]] in 1990 many foreign workers in the new federal states of the former GDR had no legal status as immigrant workers under the Western system. Consequently, many faced deportation or premature termination of residence and work permits, as well as open discrimination in the workplace.\n\n===1980-1993===\nDuring the 1980s, a small but steady stream of East Germans immigrating to the West (''\u00dcbersiedler'') had begun with the gradual opening of the Eastern bloc. It swelled to 389,000 in 1990. After the immigration law change in 1993, it decreased by more than half to 172,000.<ref name=solsten>{{cite web|author1=Eric Solsten|title=Germany: A Country Study; Chapter: Immigration|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/89.htm|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|accessdate=5 January 2015|location=Washington DC|date=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079036-0016, Lager Friedland, Familie aus Kasachstan.jpg|left|thumb| German repatriates from [[Kazakhstan]] arriving in a camp in [[Friedland, Lower Saxony|Friedland]] in 1988]]\n\nDuring the same time, the number of [[German diaspora|ethnic Germans]] (''Aussiedler'') -Germans who had settled in German territory sometimes for centuries until WWII, i.e. in present-day Eastern Europe and Russia- began to rise in the mid-1980s to about 40,000 each year. In 1987, the number doubled, in 1988 it doubled again and in 1990 nearly 400,000 immigrated.\nUpon arrival, ethnic Germans became citizens at once according to Article 116 of the Basic Law, and received financial and many social benefits, including language training, as many did not speak German. Social integration was often difficult, even though ethnic Germans were entitled to German citizenship, but to many Germans they did not seem German. In 1991, restrictions went into effect, in that ethnic Germans were assigned to certain areas, losing benefits if they were moving. The German government also encouraged the estimated several million ethnic Germans living in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to remain there. Since January 1993, no more than 220,000 ethnic Germans may immigrate per year.<ref name=solsten/>\n\nAnd in parallel a third stream of immigration starting in the mid 1980s were [[war refugee]]s, of which West Germany accepted more than any other West European country due to an unqualified [[right to asylum]]. From 1986 to 1989, about 380,000 refugees sought asylum, mostly from Iran and Lebanon.

The clan-based structure has advantages in the individualised German society where people want to live in peace under the protection of the state. On the other hand, clans do not recognize rule of law and consider it incomprehensible that of police and courts protect people. A modern society only functions when people voluntarily follow its rules, while clan member consider themselves members of a family rather than citizens of a country. As such, they consider all people who follow the laws and rules weak and without protection.<ref name=\"sueddeutsche_29sep2018\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/aussenansicht-die-macht-der-clans-1.4147228|title=Die Macht der Clans|last=Ghadban|first=Ralph|date=28 September 2018|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=2018-09-29|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Immigration in Germany}}\n\n===Governmental===\n:[https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Bevoelkerung/MigrationIntegration/AuslaendischeBevolkerung/Tabellen/AuslaendischeBevoelkerungStaatsangehoerigkeit_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile \"6.180,013\" Ausl\u00e4nder in Deutschland] \n:[http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Joachim-Gauck/Reden/2015/09/150927-Interkulturelle-Woche-Mainz.html \"Unsere Aufnahmekapazit\u00e4t ist begrenzt, ...\"] \n:[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de German Foreign Office]\n:[http://www.bamf.de/EN/Startseite/startseite-node.html Federal Office for Migration and Refugees]\n\n===Non-governmental===\n:[http://www.lg2g.info/entry Legal Guide to Germany]\n:[http://www.deutsch-werden.de German Citizenship Test]\n:[http://www.jinger.eu Information for moving to and working in Germany for immigrants]\n\n{{Immigration to Germany}}\n{{Germany topics}}\n{{Immigration to Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Immigration to Germany]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Germany]]\n\n[[de:Einwanderung#Einwanderung nach Deutschland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n| group = Demography of Germany\n| native_name = Population background\n| image = \n| pop = 82 million\n| region1 = {{flagcountry|Germany}}\n| pop1 = 65,000,000\n| ref1 = \n| region2 = {{flagcountry|Russia}}\n| pop2 = 3,500,000 (estimate, 2013)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.mid.ru//bdomp/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcbb3/55cec39404735aadc32572ea005b9953!OpenDocument |title=Regarding Upcoming Conference on Status of Russian Language Abroad |publisher=Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2014-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223001931/http://archive.mid.ru//bdomp/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcbb3/55cec39404735aadc32572ea005b9953!OpenDocument |archive-date=2015-12-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> <small>(including [[Russian Germans]])</small>\n| ref2 = \n| region3 = {{flagcountry|Poland}}\n| pop3 = 2,850,000\n| ref3 = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-06/polen-deutschland-einwanderung-integration|title=Polen in Deutschland: Verstecken war gestern|first=Christoph|last=Herwartz|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|via=Die Zeit}}</ref>\n| region4 = {{flagcountry|Turkey}}\n| pop4 = 2,774,000 '''<small>(incl.

The political background to this new law was that Germany, for the first time ever, was acknowledged to be a destination for immigrants. The practical changes{{clarify|date=December 2014}} to immigration procedures were relatively minor. New immigration categories, such as \"highly skilled professional\" and \"scientist\" were introduced to attract valuable professionals to the German labour market. The development within German immigration law shows that immigration of skilled employees and academics has eased{{clarify|date=December 2014}} while the labour market remains closed for unskilled workers.\n\nIn April 2012, [[Blue Card (European Union)|European Blue Card]] legislation was implemented in Germany, allowing highly skilled non-EU citizens easier access to work and live in Germany, subject to certain requirements. According to the federal statistics office in 2016, over one out of five Germans has at least partial roots outside of the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2017/08/PD17_261_12511.html |title = Bev\u00f6lkerung mit Migrationshintergrund um 8,5 % gestiegen}}</ref>\n\n==History of immigration to Germany==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-01986-09083, Schwarza, kubanische Gastarbeiterin.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|A so-called \"guest worker\" (''[[Gastarbeiter]]in'') from [[Cuba]], working in an [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] factory, 1986]]\n\n===After World War II until reunification (1945-1980)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n{{see also|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection#Emigration restrictions|Turks in Germany|Vietnamese people in Germany}}\n\nTowards the end of World War II,and in its aftermath, up to 12 million refugees of [[ethnic Germans]], so-called \"[[Heimatvertriebene]]\" (German for \"expellees\", literally \"homeland displaced persons\") were forced to migrate from the former German areas, as for instance [[Silesia]] or [[East Prussia]], to the new formed States of [[Allied-occupied Germany|post-war Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria]], because of changing borderlines in Europe.<ref name=\"spo\">[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/spiegelgeschichte/d-76574305.html], SpiegelOnline 25 January 2011.</ref><ref name=\"kas\">[http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8807/ \"Konrad Adenauer Stiftung\" ], viewed on 31 March 2015.</ref>  A big wave of immigration to Germany started in the 1960s. Due to a shortage of laborers during the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (\"economic miracle\") in the 1950s and 1960s, the West German government signed bilateral recruitment agreements with [[Italy]] in 1955, [[Greece]] in 1960, [[Turkey]] in 1961, [[Morocco]] in 1963, [[Portugal]] in 1964, [[Tunisia]] in 1965 and [[Yugoslavia]] in 1968. These agreements allowed the recruitment of so-called ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (\"guest workers\") to work in the industrial sector in jobs that required few qualifications.\nChildren born to 'Gastarbeiter' received the right to reside in Germany but were not granted citizenship; this was known as the ''Aufenthaltsberechtigung'' (\"right of residence\"). Many of the descendants of those ''Gastarbeiter'' still live in Germany and many have acquired German citizenship.\n\nThe [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) recruited workers from outside its borders differently. It criticized the Gastarbeiter policy, calling it capitalist exploitation of poor foreigners, and preferred to see its foreign workers as socialist \"friends\" who traveled to the GDR from other communist or socialist countries in order to learn skills which could then be applied in their home countries. Most of these came from [[North Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Cuba]].\nFollowing [[German reunification]] in 1990 many foreign workers in the new federal states of the former GDR had no legal status as immigrant workers under the Western system. Consequently, many faced deportation or premature termination of residence and work permits, as well as open discrimination in the workplace.\n\n===1980-1993===\nDuring the 1980s, a small but steady stream of East Germans immigrating to the West (''\u00dcbersiedler'') had begun with the gradual opening of the Eastern bloc. It swelled to 389,000 in 1990. After the immigration law change in 1993, it decreased by more than half to 172,000.<ref name=solsten>{{cite web|author1=Eric Solsten|title=Germany: A Country Study; Chapter: Immigration|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/89.htm|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|accessdate=5 January 2015|location=Washington DC|date=1995}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079036-0016, Lager Friedland, Familie aus Kasachstan.jpg|left|thumb| German repatriates from [[Kazakhstan]] arriving in a camp in [[Friedland, Lower Saxony|Friedland]] in 1988]]\n\nDuring the same time, the number of [[German diaspora|ethnic Germans]] (''Aussiedler'') -Germans who had settled in German territory sometimes for centuries until WWII, i.e. in present-day Eastern Europe and Russia- began to rise in the mid-1980s to about 40,000 each year. In 1987, the number doubled, in 1988 it doubled again and in 1990 nearly 400,000 immigrated.\nUpon arrival, ethnic Germans became citizens at once according to Article 116 of the Basic Law, and received financial and many social benefits, including language training, as many did not speak German. Social integration was often difficult, even though ethnic Germans were entitled to German citizenship, but to many Germans they did not seem German. In 1991, restrictions went into effect, in that ethnic Germans were assigned to certain areas, losing benefits if they were moving. The German government also encouraged the estimated several million ethnic Germans living in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to remain there. Since January 1993, no more than 220,000 ethnic Germans may immigrate per year.<ref name=solsten/>\n\nAnd in parallel a third stream of immigration starting in the mid 1980s were [[war refugee]]s, of which West Germany accepted more than any other West European country due to an unqualified [[right to asylum]]. From 1986 to 1989, about 380,000 refugees sought asylum, mostly from Iran and Lebanon.

All ethnic crime gangs are collectively treated as organized crime.<ref name=\"sueddeutsche_29sep2018\"/>\n\nThe profitable activities of Arab clans have been noted by other minorities and Chechens, Albanians, Kosovars have created similar clan-based gangs. The clan-based structure has advantages in the individualised German society where people want to live in peace under the protection of the state. On the other hand, clans do not recognize rule of law and consider it incomprehensible that of police and courts protect people. A modern society only functions when people voluntarily follow its rules, while clan member consider themselves members of a family rather than citizens of a country. As such, they consider all people who follow the laws and rules weak and without protection.<ref name=\"sueddeutsche_29sep2018\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/aussenansicht-die-macht-der-clans-1.4147228|title=Die Macht der Clans|last=Ghadban|first=Ralph|date=28 September 2018|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=2018-09-29|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Immigration in Germany}}\n\n===Governmental===\n:[https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Bevoelkerung/MigrationIntegration/AuslaendischeBevolkerung/Tabellen/AuslaendischeBevoelkerungStaatsangehoerigkeit_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile \"6.180,013\" Ausl\u00e4nder in Deutschland] \n:[http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Joachim-Gauck/Reden/2015/09/150927-Interkulturelle-Woche-Mainz.html \"Unsere Aufnahmekapazit\u00e4t ist begrenzt, ...\"] \n:[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de German Foreign Office]\n:[http://www.bamf.de/EN/Startseite/startseite-node.html Federal Office for Migration and Refugees]\n\n===Non-governmental===\n:[http://www.lg2g.info/entry Legal Guide to Germany]\n:[http://www.deutsch-werden.de German Citizenship Test]\n:[http://www.jinger.eu Information for moving to and working in Germany for immigrants]\n\n{{Immigration to Germany}}\n{{Germany topics}}\n{{Immigration to Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Immigration to Germany]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Germany]]\n\n[[de:Einwanderung#Einwanderung nach Deutschland]]\n", "name_user": "SsondaC", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Germany"}
