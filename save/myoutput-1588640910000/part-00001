Both incarnations of the household were musical and by 1935 the family was singing at the local church in [[Aigen (Salzburg city district)|Aigen]] where they made the acquaintance of a young priest, Dr. Franz Wasner, who encouraged their musical progress and taught them sacred music to add to the folk songs, madrigals and ballads they were already singing.<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, Elizabeth M., 2007: Introduction to English Translation of Georg von Trapp: \"To the Last Salute: Memories of an Austrian U-Boat Commander\".

They arrived with very little money, having lost most of the family fortune earlier during a 1935 banking collapse in Austria. Once in the United States they earned money by performing and touring nationally and internationally, first as the \"Trapp Family Choir\" and then, the \"Trapp Family Singers\".

They purchased a {{convert|660|acre|adj=on}} farm in 1942 and converted it into the [[Trapp Family Lodge]], initially called \"Cor Unum\".
