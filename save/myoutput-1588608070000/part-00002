Groundwater, on the other hand, has a relatively constant input and is controlled more by long-term patterns of precipitation.<ref>{{Cite web | author= Basic Biology | date= 16 January 2016 | title= River | url= https://basicbiology.net/environment/freshwater/river}}</ref> The stream encompasses surface, subsurface and groundwater fluxes that respond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biotic controls.<ref>Alexander, L.

Long large streams are usually called [[river]]s.\n\nStreams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and corridors for [[fish]] and [[wildlife]] migration.  The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]].  Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentathygiyihl;o;nion|fragmented habitat]]s and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]].

Most of this water re-enters the atmosphere by [[evaporation]] from soil and water bodies, or by the [[evapotranspiration]] of plants. Some of the water proceeds to sink into the earth by [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and becomes [[groundwater]], much of which eventually enters streams.  Some precipitated water is temporarily locked up in snow fields and [[glacier]]s, to be released later by evaporation or melting.  The rest of the water flows off the land as [[Surface runoff|runoff]], the proportion of which varies according to many factors, such as wind, humidity, vegetation, rock types, and relief. This runoff starts as a thin film called sheet wash, combined with a network of tiny rills, together constituting sheet runoff; when this water is concentrated in a channel, a stream has its birth. Some creeks may start from ponds or lakes.\n\n[[File:Audubon Society long exposure.JPG|thumb|Stream in Southbury, Connecticut, US]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n; Ranking\nTo qualify as a stream, a body of water must be either recurring or perennial. Recurring ([[Intermittent stream|intermittent]]) streams have water in the channel for at least part of the year. A stream of the [[Strahler Stream Order|first order]] is a stream which does not have any other recurring or perennial stream feeding into it. When two first-order streams come together, they form a second-order stream. When two second-order streams come together, they form a third-order stream. Streams of lower order joining a higher order stream do not change the order of the higher stream. Thus, if a first-order stream joins a second-order stream, it remains a second-order stream. It is not until a second-order stream combines with another second-order stream that it becomes a third-order stream.\n\n; Gradient\nThe ''gradient'' of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character and is entirely determined by its [[base level]] of erosion.  The base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean, a lake or pond, or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient, and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream.\n\nIn geological terms, the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course.  If this base level is low, then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient, and if the base level is relatively high, then the stream will form a flood plain and meander.\n\n; Meander\n[[Meander]]s are looping changes of direction of a stream caused by the erosion and deposition of bank materials.  These are typically serpentine in form. Typically, over time the meanders gradually migrate downstream.\n\nIf some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander, a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter, leaving behind an arc-shaped body of water termed an ''[[oxbow lake]]'' or ''bayou''.  A flood may also cause a meander to be cut through in this way.\n\n; Profile\nTypically, streams are said to have a particular ''profile'', beginning with steep gradients, no flood plain, and little shifting of channels, eventually evolving into streams with low gradients, wide flood plains, and extensive meanders. The initial stage is sometimes termed a \"young\" or \"immature\" stream, and the later state a \"mature\" or \"old\" stream.  However, a stream may meander for some distance before falling into a \"young\" stream condition.\n\n; [[Stream load]]\nStreams can carry sediment, or alluvium. The amount of load it can carry (capacity) as well as the largest object it can carry (competence) are both dependent on the [[velocity]] of the stream.\n\n==Intermittent and ephemeral streams==\n{{See also|Intermittent river}}\n\n[[File:Low creek.jpg|thumb|Australian creek, low in the dry season, carrying little water.

Washes can fill up quickly during rains, and there may be a sudden torrent of water after a [[thunderstorm]] begins upstream, such as during [[monsoon]]al conditions.  These [[flash flood]]s often catch travelers by surprise. An intermittent stream can also be called an [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]] in [[Latin America]], a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne]] in Britain, or a [[wadi]] in the [[Arabic]]-speaking world.\n\nIn [[Italy]], an intermittent stream is termed a '''torrent''' {{in it|torrente}}. In full flood the stream may or may not be \"torrential\" in the dramatic sense of the word, but there will be one or more seasons in which the flow is reduced to a trickle or less. Typically torrents have [[Apennine mountains|Apennine]] rather than [[Alps|Alpine]] sources, and in the summer they are fed by little precipitation and no melting snow. In this case the maximum discharge will be during the spring and autumn. However, there are also glacial torrents with a different seasonal regime.\n\nIn Australia, an intermittent stream is usually called a creek and marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line.\n\n==Drainage basins==\nThe extent of land basin drained by a stream is termed its '''[[drainage basin]]''' (also known in North America as the '''watershed''' and, in British English, as a '''catchment''').<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Hydrologic Definitions: Watershed |title=Manual of Hydrology: Part 1.

For instance, the [[Continental Divide]] in North America divides the mainly easterly-draining [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Arctic Ocean]] basins from the largely westerly-flowing [[Pacific Ocean]] basin. The Atlantic Ocean basin, however, may be further subdivided into the Atlantic Ocean and [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainages. (This delineation is termed the [[Eastern Continental Divide]].) Similarly, the Gulf of Mexico basin may be divided into the [[Mississippi River]] basin and several smaller basins, such as the [[Tombigbee River]] basin.

Most of this water re-enters the atmosphere by [[evaporation]] from soil and water bodies, or by the [[evapotranspiration]] of plants. Some of the water proceeds to sink into the earth by [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and becomes [[groundwater]], much of which eventually enters streams.  Some precipitated water is temporarily locked up in snow fields and [[glacier]]s, to be released later by evaporation or melting.  The rest of the water flows off the land as [[Surface runoff|runoff]], the proportion of which varies according to many factors, such as wind, humidity, vegetation, rock types, and relief. This runoff starts as a thin film called sheet wash, combined with a network of tiny rills, together constituting sheet runoff; when this water is concentrated in a channel, a stream has its birth. Some creeks may start from ponds or lakes.\n\n[[File:Audubon Society long exposure.JPG|thumb|Stream in Southbury, Connecticut, US]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n; Ranking\nTo qualify as a stream, a body of water must be either recurring or perennial. Recurring ([[Intermittent stream|intermittent]]) streams have water in the channel for at least part of the year. A stream of the [[Strahler Stream Order|first order]] is a stream which does not have any other recurring or perennial stream feeding into it. When two first-order streams come together, they form a second-order stream. When two second-order streams come together, they form a third-order stream. Streams of lower order joining a higher order stream do not change the order of the higher stream. Thus, if a first-order stream joins a second-order stream, it remains a second-order stream. It is not until a second-order stream combines with another second-order stream that it becomes a third-order stream.\n\n; Gradient\nThe ''gradient'' of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character and is entirely determined by its [[base level]] of erosion.  The base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean, a lake or pond, or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient, and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream.\n\nIn geological terms, the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course.  If this base level is low, then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient, and if the base level is relatively high, then the stream will form a flood plain and meander.\n\n; Meander\n[[Meander]]s are looping changes of direction of a stream caused by the erosion and deposition of bank materials.  These are typically serpentine in form. Typically, over time the meanders gradually migrate downstream.\n\nIf some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander, a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter, leaving behind an arc-shaped body of water termed an ''[[oxbow lake]]'' or ''bayou''.  A flood may also cause a meander to be cut through in this way.\n\n; Profile\nTypically, streams are said to have a particular ''profile'', beginning with steep gradients, no flood plain, and little shifting of channels, eventually evolving into streams with low gradients, wide flood plains, and extensive meanders. The initial stage is sometimes termed a \"young\" or \"immature\" stream, and the later state a \"mature\" or \"old\" stream.  However, a stream may meander for some distance before falling into a \"young\" stream condition.\n\n; [[Stream load]]\nStreams can carry sediment, or alluvium. The amount of load it can carry (capacity) as well as the largest object it can carry (competence) are both dependent on the [[velocity]] of the stream.\n\n==Intermittent and ephemeral streams==\n{{See also|Intermittent river}}\n\n[[File:Low creek.jpg|thumb|Australian creek, low in the dry season, carrying little water.

Washes can fill up quickly during rains, and there may be a sudden torrent of water after a [[thunderstorm]] begins upstream, such as during [[monsoon]]al conditions.  These [[flash flood]]s often catch travelers by surprise. An intermittent stream can also be called an [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]] in [[Latin America]], a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne]] in Britain, or a [[wadi]] in the [[Arabic]]-speaking world.\n\nIn [[Italy]], an intermittent stream is termed a '''torrent''' {{in it|torrente}}. In full flood the stream may or may not be \"torrential\" in the dramatic sense of the word, but there will be one or more seasons in which the flow is reduced to a trickle or less. Typically torrents have [[Apennine mountains|Apennine]] rather than [[Alps|Alpine]] sources, and in the summer they are fed by little precipitation and no melting snow. In this case the maximum discharge will be during the spring and autumn. However, there are also glacial torrents with a different seasonal regime.\n\nIn Australia, an intermittent stream is usually called a creek and marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line.\n\n==Drainage basins==\nThe extent of land basin drained by a stream is termed its '''[[drainage basin]]''' (also known in North America as the '''watershed''' and, in British English, as a '''catchment''').<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Hydrologic Definitions: Watershed |title=Manual of Hydrology: Part 1.

The Atlantic Ocean basin, however, may be further subdivided into the Atlantic Ocean and [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainages. (This delineation is termed the [[Eastern Continental Divide]].) Similarly, the Gulf of Mexico basin may be divided into the [[Mississippi River]] basin and several smaller basins, such as the [[Tombigbee River]] basin. Continuing in this vein, a component of the Mississippi River basin is the [[Ohio River]] basin, which in turn includes the [[Kentucky River]] basin, and so forth.\n\n==Crossings==\n[[Stream crossing]]s are where streams are crossed by [[road]]s, [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[railway]]s, or any other thing which might restrict the flow of the stream in ordinary or [[flood]] conditions. Any structure over or in a stream which results in limitations on the movement of fish or other ecological elements may be an issue.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chalk stream]]\n* [[Head cut (stream geomorphology)|Head cut]]\n* [[Playfair's Law]]\n* [[River ecosystem]]\n* [[Rock-cut basin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|stream}}\n{{Commons category|Streams}}\n{{wikiquote|Streams}}\n* [http://old.streamnet.org/glossarystream.html Glossary of stream-related terms], StreamNet\n\n{{rivers, streams and springs}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Water streams| ]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water]]\n[[Category:Fluvial landforms]]\n[[Category:Geomorphology]]\n[[Category:Hydrology]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n\n[[kk:\u0420\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0439 (\u041a\u044b\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u044b\u0441\u044b)]]\n", "name_user": "2604:3d09:e37f:d6c0:41ba:5751:c6b1:f8c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"}
