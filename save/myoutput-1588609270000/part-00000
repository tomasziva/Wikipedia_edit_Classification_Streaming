Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing. She originally thought the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks.

[[Louis Walsh]] was in his favour, but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini|Cheryl Cole]] and guest judge [[Katy Perry]] felt that he needed some time to grow. [[Simon Cowell]] voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes.  Horan was then put through to bootcamp.\n\n[[File:One Direction X Factor Live Glasgow 2.jpg|thumb|left|Horan with One Direction on ''The X Factor'' Live Tour in 2011]]\nAt bootcamp, he sang \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge [[Nicole Scherzinger]], Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.\n\nThe group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" and [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]] and winner [[Matt Cardle]].\n\n===2011\u20132015: One Direction===\nFollowing ''The X Factor'', One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million [[Syco]] record contract. They began recording their debut album in Los Angeles in January 2011. That February, a book licensed by One Direction, ''One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story)'', was released and topped ''[[The Sunday Times]]''' Best Seller list. That same month, the band and other contestants from the series participated in ''The X Factor Live Tour''. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers such as [[Carl Falk]], [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Steve Mac]], and [[Rami Yacoub]].\n\nOne Direction's debut single, \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\", was released in September 2011.

Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.\n\nThe group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" and [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]] and winner [[Matt Cardle]].\n\n===2011\u20132015: One Direction===\nFollowing ''The X Factor'', One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million [[Syco]] record contract. They began recording their debut album in Los Angeles in January 2011. That February, a book licensed by One Direction, ''One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story)'', was released and topped ''[[The Sunday Times]]''' Best Seller list. That same month, the band and other contestants from the series participated in ''The X Factor Live Tour''. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers such as [[Carl Falk]], [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Steve Mac]], and [[Rami Yacoub]].\n\nOne Direction's debut single, \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\", was released in September 2011. A global and commercial success, the song reached number one in several countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Direction on UK|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/one%20direction/|website=The Official Chart Company|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mexico Airplay |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/charts/internationalcharts/mexico |accessdate=1 January 2016 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69HQ7r3yp?url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/charts/internationalcharts/mexico |archivedate=19 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Track Archive|url=http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fmusicvideo%2Fmusic%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&ct=240001&arch=t&lyr=2011&year=2011&week=37|website=GFK Chart Track|accessdate=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827045450/http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fmusicvideo%2Fmusic%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&ct=240001&arch=t&lyr=2011&year=2011&week=37|archive-date=27 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7408939/ask-billboard-one-directions-career-sales |title = Ask Billboard: One Direction's Career Sales}}</ref> Subsequent singles, \"[[Gotta Be You (One Direction song)|Gotta Be You]]\", \"[[One Thing (One Direction song)|One Thing]]\", and \"[[More than This (One Direction song)|More than This]]\", had also received success,<ref>{{cite web|title=More Than This on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=More+Than+This&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=One Thing on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=One+Thing&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gotta Be You on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=Gotta+Be+You&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref> with the first two becoming top ten hits in the UK.
