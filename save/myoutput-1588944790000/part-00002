The first congregational congregation was founded at [[Llanfaches]] in 1639. Early founders were in the puritan tradition. Later several churches were founded and formed separate denominations. They embraced different theological positions. Finally the denomination was founded in 1872 as a voluntary association of churches. They called it Independent because each congregation claims to be under the authority of [[Christ]]. Individual congregations cooperate through associations. Now the Union works through six departments: finance, [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]], [[Christian ministry|ministry]], education, churches, communication. The Union churches have much in common with other free churches in Wales. Ministers can freely move their ministry among them. The Unions council met once a year. ''The Union is a free and voluntary body, its aims to help to make churches a fellowship that serve Jesus Christ''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/union-of-welsh-independents|title=Union of Welsh Independents \u2014 World Council of Churches|website=www.oikoumene.org}}</ref> The church has high emphasis on preaching the [[Gospel]], and education, empowering church members.
