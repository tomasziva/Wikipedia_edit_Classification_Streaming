This was the logo seen in front of all films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', again created by Imaginary Forces. Kevin Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within The Walt Disney Company, it \"felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features\" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that \"We didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\"<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\">{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |title=Introducing the New Marvel Studios Logo |last=Strom |first=Marc |date=November 12, 2013 |publisher=Marvel |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131115084009/http%3A//marvel%2Ecom/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |archive-date=November 15, 2013 |access-date=November 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, ultimately choosing 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\"<ref name=\"ImaginaryForces\" />\n\nThe new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] through ''Captain America: Civil War''. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by [[Brian Tyler]], who wrote the scores to ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor: The Dark World'', and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\" /> It was featured on the films ''Thor: The Dark World'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.\n\nIn July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by [[Michael Giacchino]], who composed the scores to ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''. The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings, but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |title=See the New Marvel Studios Logo and Intro from Comic-Con |last=Perry |first=Spencer |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725150336/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was first seen in front of ''Doctor Strange''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |title=SDCC: New Marvel Studios Logo and Opening Fanfare Revealed |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725181957/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The updated logo was created by Perception, who were first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo. Feige specifically requested Perception \"to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.\" The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed \"How to Build a Universe\", which \"was designed to pay tribute to [the film making] process by touching on\" how a film's origins is inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial \"flipbook\" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes \"various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays\", with Perception picking \"both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.\" To add in the concept art images, Perception looked \"through a massive archive of concept art and \"The Art Of\u2026\" books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.\" Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the \"vault\" \"where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the \"Marvel\" logotype.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |title=Marvel Studios Logo |publisher=Perception |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204200932/http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |access-date=January 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017 [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |title=Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years Logo Unveiled at D23 |last=Hoffmeyer |first=Corey |date=July 15, 2017 |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716043557/http://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |archive-date=July 16, 2017 |access-date=July 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The logo debuted with ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' on April 26, 2018 and was used again in ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''.

This was the logo seen in front of all films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', again created by Imaginary Forces. Kevin Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within The Walt Disney Company, it \"felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features\" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that \"We didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\"<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\">{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |title=Introducing the New Marvel Studios Logo |last=Strom |first=Marc |date=November 12, 2013 |publisher=Marvel |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131115084009/http%3A//marvel%2Ecom/news/story/21508/introducing_the_new_marvel_studios_logo |archive-date=November 15, 2013 |access-date=November 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, ultimately choosing 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\"<ref name=\"ImaginaryForces\" />\n\nThe new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] through ''Captain America: Civil War''. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by [[Brian Tyler]], who wrote the scores to ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor: The Dark World'', and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"NewFlipbook\" /> It was featured on the films ''Thor: The Dark World'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.\n\nIn July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by [[Michael Giacchino]], who composed the scores to ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''. The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings, but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |title=See the New Marvel Studios Logo and Intro from Comic-Con |last=Perry |first=Spencer |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725150336/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/705551-see-the-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-intro-from-comic-con |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was first seen in front of ''Doctor Strange''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |title=SDCC: New Marvel Studios Logo and Opening Fanfare Revealed |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=July 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725181957/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-new-marvel-studios-logo-and-opening-fanfare-revealed |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The updated logo was created by Perception, who were first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo. Feige specifically requested Perception \"to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.\" The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed \"How to Build a Universe\", which \"was designed to pay tribute to [the film making] process by touching on\" how a film's origins is inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial \"flipbook\" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes \"various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays\", with Perception picking \"both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.\" To add in the concept art images, Perception looked \"through a massive archive of concept art and \"The Art Of\u2026\" books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.\" Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the \"vault\" \"where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the \"Marvel\" logotype.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |title=Marvel Studios Logo |publisher=Perception |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204200932/http://www.experienceperception.com/case-study/marvelstudios/ |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |access-date=January 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017 [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |title=Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years Logo Unveiled at D23 |last=Hoffmeyer |first=Corey |date=July 15, 2017 |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716043557/http://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-first-ten-years-logo/ |archive-date=July 16, 2017 |access-date=July 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The logo debuted with ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' on April 26, 2018 and was used again in ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''.
