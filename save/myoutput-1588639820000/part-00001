Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878. This birth date is maintained in his School Leaving Certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, a police arrest record from 18 April 1902 which gave his age as 23 years, and all other surviving pre-Revolution documents.

Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a [[Collective leadership in the Soviet Union|collective leadership]], he eventually consolidated power to become the country's ''de facto'' [[dictator]] by the 1930s. A [[communist]] ideologically committed to the [[Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin formalised these ideas as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], while his own policies are known as [[Stalinism]].\n\n<!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power-->\nBorn to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and [[protection rackets]]. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a [[one-party state]] under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's 1924 death]]. Under Stalin, \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\" became a central tenet of the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party's dogma]]. Through the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialisation]], creating a centralised [[command economy]]. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]]. To eradicate accused \"[[enemies of the working class]]\", Stalin instituted the \"[[Great Purge]]\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n\n<!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death-->\nStalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported European [[anti-fascist]] movements during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Soviet sphere of influence|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Chinese Civil War|China]], and [[Soviet Civil Administration|North Korea]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946\u201347|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[doctors' plot]]. After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced him]] and initiated the [[de-Stalinisation]] of [[Soviet society]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and [[socialism]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|mass repressions]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|that killed millions]].\n<!--please do not remove, for ToC spacing-->\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}\n\n===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878\u20131899===\nStalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] and home to a mix of Georgian, Armenian, Russian, and Jewish communities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} He was born on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 Dec}},{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's exact date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878.
