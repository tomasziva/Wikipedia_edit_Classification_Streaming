Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Its southern [[Canada\u2013United States border|border with the United States]], stretching {{convert|8891|km|mi}}, is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]].\n\nVarious [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada]] for thousands of years before European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]'' of 1931 and culminated in the ''[[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]]'' of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[British parliament]].\n\nCanada is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]], with a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] and a [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] who serves as the chair of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] and [[Government of Canada|head of government]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] and [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, [[economic freedom]], and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canada\u2013United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its [[Economy of Canada|economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].\n\nA [[developed country]], Canada has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally]] as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|thirteenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]], the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.\n\n==Etymology==\n<!--linked-->\n{{Main|Name of Canada}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing this to specify which languages produced the word Canada.

Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Its southern [[Canada\u2013United States border|border with the United States]], stretching {{convert|8891|km|mi}}, is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]].\n\nVarious [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada]] for thousands of years before European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]'' of 1931 and culminated in the ''[[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]]'' of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[British parliament]].\n\nCanada is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]], with a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] and a [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] who serves as the chair of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] and [[Government of Canada|head of government]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] and [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, [[economic freedom]], and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canada\u2013United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its [[Economy of Canada|economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].\n\nA [[developed country]], Canada has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally]] as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|thirteenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]], the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.\n\n==Etymology==\n<!--linked-->\n{{Main|Name of Canada}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing this to specify which languages produced the word Canada.
