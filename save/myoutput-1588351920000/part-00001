Her work on [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] (now known as Matiyasevich's theorem or the MRDP theorem) played a crucial role in its ultimate resolution. Robinson was a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|1983 MacArthur Fellow]].\n\n== Early years ==\nRobinson was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the daughter of Ralph Bowers Bowman and Helen (Hall) Bowman.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|4}} Her father owned a machine equipment company while her mother was a school teacher before marriage.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|4}} Her mother died when Robinson was 2 years old and her father remarried.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|4}} Her older sister was the mathematical popularizer and biographer [[Constance Reid]] and her younger sister is Billie Comstock.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|22}}\n\nWhen she was 9 years old, she was diagnosed with scarlet fever which was shortly followed by rheumatic fever.<ref name=\"Autobiography\">{{cite book|url=https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Polya/07468342.di020720.02p00912.pdf|title=The Autobiography of Julia Robinson|last1=Reid|first1=Constance|date=1986|publisher=The College Mathematics Journal|pages=3\u201321|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>{{Rp|4}} This caused her to miss two years of school.

Before she was able to transfer to UC Berkeley, her father committed suicide in 1937 due to financial insecurities.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|5}} She took five mathematics courses in her first year at Berkeley<ref>https://www.nap.edu/read/4560/chapter/21#455</ref>, one being a number theory course taught by [[Raphael M.

She received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1940.,<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|5}} and later married Raphael in 1941.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|5}}\n\n==Mathematical contributions==\n\nAfter graduating, Robinson continued in graduate studies at Berkeley. As a graduate student, Robinson was employed as a teaching assistant with the Department of Mathematics and later as a statistics lab assistant by [[Jerzy Neyman]] in the Berkeley Statistical Laboratory, where her work resulted in her first published paper, titled \"''A Note on Exact Sequential Analysis\"''.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\" />{{Rp|5}}\n\nRobinson received her [[Ph.D.]] degree in 1948 under [[Alfred Tarski]] with a dissertation on \"Definability and Decision Problems in Arithmetic\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|14}}\nHer dissertation showed that the theory of the rational numbers was an [[undecidable problem]], by demonstrating that elementary number theory could be defined in terms of the rationals.

For instance from Theorem 3.2 and Godel's result, we can conclude that the relation which holds between three rationals ''A, B,'' and ''N'' if and only if ''N'' is a positive integer and A=B<sup>''N''</sup> is definable in the arithmetic of rationals.\" <ref>Robinson, J.

Robinson began exploring methods for this problem in 1948 while at the [[RAND Corporation]]. Her work regarding Diophantine representation for exponentiation and her method of using [[Pell's equation]] led to the J.R. hypothesis (named after Robinson) in 1950.  Proving this hypothesis would be central in the final solution.  Her research publications would lead to collaborations with [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Yuri Matiyasevich]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Decision Problem for Exponential Diophantine Equations|last1=Robinson|first1=Julia|last2=Davis|first2=Martin|last3=Putnam|first3=Hilary|date=1961|publisher=Annals of Mathematics|location=Princeton University}}</ref> \n\nIn 1950, Robinson first met Martin Davis, then an instructor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was trying to show that all sets with listability property were Diophantine in contrast to Robinson's attempt to show that a few special sets \u2014 including prime numbers and the powers of 2 \u2014 were Diophantine. Robinson and Davis started collaborating in 1959 and were later joined by Hilary Putnam, they then showed that the solutions to a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d equation was key to Hilbert's tenth problem.<ref>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-julia-robinson-helped-define-limits-mathematical-knowledge</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the problem was resolved in the negative; that is, they showed that no such algorithm can exist.  Through the 1970s, Robinson continued working with Matiyasevich on one of their solution's corollaries, which she once stated that\n\n<blockquote>there is a constant N such that, given a Diophantine equation with any number of parameters and in any number of unknowns, one can effectively transform this equation into another with the same parameters but in only N unknowns such that both equations are solvable or unsolvable for the same values of the parameters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~yumat/Julia/|title=My Collaboration with JULIA ROBINSON|website=logic.pdmi.ras.ru|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the time the solution was first published, the authors established N = 200.  Robinson and Matiyasevich's joint work would produce further reduction to 9 unknowns.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Game Theory ===\nDuring the late 1940s, Robinson spent a year or so at the [[RAND Corporation]] in Santa Monica researching game theory which led to her published paper called \"''An Iterative Method of Solving a Game''\" in 1951.<ref name=\"NAS Memoir\">\n{{cite encyclopedia|last=Feferman|first=Solomon|authorlink=Solomon Feferman|encyclopedia=Biographical Memoirs|title=Julia Bowman Robinson, 1919\u20131985|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/robinson-julia.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-06-18|year=1994|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|volume=63|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-309-04976-4|pages=1\u201328}}\n</ref>{{Rp|7}} In her paper, she proved that the [[fictitious play]] dynamics converges to the [[mixed strategy]] [[Nash equilibrium]] in two-player [[zero-sum]] games.

It took time for her to accept the nomination, stated in her autobiography:<blockquote>\"In 1982 I was nominated for the presidency of the American Mathematical Society. I realized that I had been chosen because I was a woman and because I had the seal of approval, as it were, of the National Academy. After discussion with Raphael, who thought I should decline and save my energy for mathematics, and other members of my family, who differed with him, I decided that as a woman and a mathematician I had no alternative but to accept. I have always tried to do everything I could to encourage talented women to become research mathematicians. I found my service as president of the Society taxing but very, very satisfying.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1982, Robinson was given the Noether award through the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] and did a lecture series called ''Functional Equations in Arithmetic.'' <ref>\"Noether Brochure: Julia Robinson, Functional Equations in Arithmetic\". Association for Women in Mathematics. Retrieved 2008-06-18</ref> Around this time she also was given the MacArthur Fellowship Prize of $60,000.

It took time for her to accept the nomination, stated in her autobiography:<blockquote>\"In 1982 I was nominated for the presidency of the American Mathematical Society. I realized that I had been chosen because I was a woman and because I had the seal of approval, as it were, of the National Academy. After discussion with Raphael, who thought I should decline and save my energy for mathematics, and other members of my family, who differed with him, I decided that as a woman and a mathematician I had no alternative but to accept. I have always tried to do everything I could to encourage talented women to become research mathematicians. I found my service as president of the Society taxing but very, very satisfying.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1982, Robinson was given the Noether award through the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] and did a lecture series called ''Functional Equations in Arithmetic.'' <ref>\"Noether Brochure: Julia Robinson, Functional Equations in Arithmetic\".
