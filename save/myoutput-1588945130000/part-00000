The team is currently based in Vile Parle, Mumbai, India and was conceptually founded in 2012 with the purpose to represent its university at the international Formula Student and national Formula Bharat competitions.\n\nThe team went on to make its first international appearance at the Formula Student Germany competition in 2014. It has won a total of three international titles and six national titles from 2014-2020. DJSR has become one of the most successful Indian teams in recent Formula Student history, being the best overall ranked Indian team in FSG17 and the only Indian team to have designed and manufactured 2 cars in the 2018-19 season. It hence became the first Indian Team to participate in Formula Bharat in the electric, as well as combustion category. It was bestowed the special recognition, \"Never Give Up\" award in FSG19. \n\nThe competition requires students to use their engineering concepts to design and manufacture a single-seater high performance race car in the most cost efficient manner and the team designs and manufactures at least one model every year.\n\n==Racing seasons==\n===Season 1 (2014)===\n[[File:DJSR01, the first car ever made by the team.png|center|thumb|353x353px|DJSR01, the first car ever manufactured by the team]]\n\nDJS Racing debuted in Formula Student Germany 2014 with its first prototype DJSR 01.

They were awarded 1st Prize in Design Event because of their excellent skills on validating the concepts behind designing the car. Along with this, they performed really well in static events and were 2nd best in Static events and 3rd most fuel efficient car at the competition.\n\nThe team even qualified for Formula Student Germany by being the 10th fastest team to clear the quiz all around the world. For this event, the car was upgraded after its Indian competition by implementing Drexler Differential, Data Acquisition System, etc. It was acclaimed the Best Indian team at the competition and was the 2nd best Asian team too. They secured 41st position overall with 13th place in Cost event, 16th place in Design event and 23rd place in Business Presentation.

The second prototype weighed just under 200 kilograms, achieving a 30% weight reduction over the previous variant. With this car the team competed at Formula Student India 2016, securing a 6th position overall despite being a first-year team at the competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=DNA Report|url=http://54.254.97.154/locality/mumbai-north-central/go-vroom-vile-parle-students-secure-sixth-position-formula-students-india-2016-87146|website=DNA Mumbai}}</ref> The all-inclusive transmission and suspension design, along with the compact packaging of the car, led the team to securing a coveted 4th position in the design finals. The team's well-maintained finances and budgeting resulted in the team placing 2nd in the cost event. DJSR 02 was among 9 teams who competed in the endurance event.

They were awarded 1st Prize in Design Event because of their excellent skills on validating the concepts behind designing the car. Along with this, they performed really well in static events and were 2nd best in Static events and 3rd most fuel efficient car at the competition.\n\nThe team even qualified for Formula Student Germany by being the 10th fastest team to clear the quiz all around the world. For this event, the car was upgraded after its Indian competition by implementing Drexler Differential, Data Acquisition System, etc. It was acclaimed the Best Indian team at the competition and was the 2nd best Asian team too. They secured 41st position overall with 13th place in Cost event, 16th place in Design event and 23rd place in Business Presentation.
