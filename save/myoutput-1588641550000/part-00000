At the age of 16, she lost both her parents and her infant brother in the [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|1878 yellow fever epidemic]]. She went to work and kept the rest of the family together with the help of her grandmother. Later moving with some of her siblings to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], she found better pay as a teacher. Soon, Wells co-owned and wrote for the ''Memphis Free Speech and Headlight'' newspaper. Her reporting covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wells documented [[lynching in the United States]] through her indictment called \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases,\" investigating frequent claims of whites that lynchings were reserved for black criminals only. Wells exposed lynching as a barbaric practice of whites in the South used to intimidate and oppress African Americans who created economic and political competition\u2014and a subsequent threat of loss of power\u2014for whites. A white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses as her investigative reporting was carried nationally in black-owned newspapers.\n\nSubjected to continued threats, Wells left Memphis for [[Chicago]]. She married and had a family while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women's movement for the rest of her life. Wells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)|civil rights movement]] and the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].

Wells resisted this solution. To keep her younger siblings together as a family, she found work as a teacher in a black elementary school in Holly Springs. Her paternal grandmother, Peggy Wells, along with other friends and relatives, stayed with her siblings and cared for them during the week while Wells was teaching.\n\nBut when Peggy Wells died from a stroke and her sister Eugenia died, Wells accepted the invitation of her aunt Fanny and moved with her two youngest sisters to Memphis in 1883.\n\n==Early career and anti-segregation activism==\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#F3F0FD|salign=right|It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed ...

The previous year, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled against the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] (which had banned racial discrimination in public accommodations). This verdict supported railroad companies that chose to racially segregate their passengers. When Wells refused to give up her seat, the conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. Wells gained publicity in Memphis when she wrote a newspaper article for ''The Living Way'', a black church weekly, about her treatment on the train.

The two boys got into an argument and a fight during the game. As the black boy Harris began to win the fight, the father of Cornelius Hurst intervened and began to \"thrash\" Harris.

Black economic progress was a contemporary issue in the South, and in many states whites worked to suppress black progress. In this period at the turn of the century, Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed laws and/or new constitutions to [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise most black people and many poor white people]] through use of [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]] and other devices. Wells-Barnett recommended that black people use arms to defend against lynching.<ref name=\"Southern Horrors\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14975/14975-h/14975-h.htm ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases''.]</ref>\n\nShe followed-up with greater research and detail in ''The Red Record'' (1895), a 100-page pamphlet describing lynching in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. It also covered black peoples' struggles in the South since the Civil War. ''The Red Record'' explored the alarmingly high rates of lynching in the United States (which was at a peak from 1880 to 1930). Wells-Barnett said that during Reconstruction, most Americans outside the South did not realize the growing rate of violence against black people in the South. She believed that during slavery, white people had not committed as many attacks because of the economic labour value of slaves. Wells noted that, since slavery time, \"ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, [through lynching] without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution.\"\n\n[[Frederick Douglass]] had written an article noting three eras of \"Southern barbarism\" and the excuses that whites claimed in each period.\n\nWells-Barnett explored these in detail in her ''The Red Record''.\n* During slavery time, she noted that whites worked to \"repress and stamp out alleged 'race riots{{'\"}} or suspected slave rebellions, usually killing black people in far higher proportions than any white casualties. Once the Civil War ended, white people feared black people, who were in the majority in many areas. White people acted to control them and suppress them by violence.\n* During the [[Reconstruction Era]] white people lynched black people as part of mob efforts to suppress black political activity and re-establish [[white supremacy]] after the war. They feared \"Negro Domination\" through voting and taking office. Wells-Barnett urged black people in high-risk areas to move away to protect their families.\n* She noted that whites frequently claimed that black men had \"to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women\". She noted that white people assumed that any relationship between a white woman and a black man was a result of rape. But, given power relationships, it was much more common for white men to take sexual advantage of poor black women. She stated: \"Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that black men rape white women.\" Wells connected lynching to sexual violence, showing how the myth of the black man's lust for white women led to murder of African-American men.\n\nWells-Barnett gave 14 pages of statistics related to lynching cases committed from 1892 to 1895; she also included pages of graphic accounts detailing specific lynchings. She notes that her data was taken from articles by white correspondents, white press bureaus, and white newspapers. ''The Red Record'' was a huge pamphlet, and had far-reaching influence in the debate about lynching. ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'' and ''The Red Record'''s accounts of these lynchings grabbed the attention of Northerners who knew little about lynching or accepted the common explanation that black men deserved this fate. Generally southern states and white juries refused to indict any perpetrators for lynching, although they were frequently known and sometimes shown in the photographs being made more frequently of such events.\n\nDespite Wells-Barnett's attempt to garner support among white Americans against lynching, she believed that her campaign could not overturn the economic interests whites had in using lynching as an instrument to maintain Southern order and discourage Black economic ventures. Ultimately, Wells-Barnett concluded that appealing to reason and compassion would not succeed in gaining criminalization of lynching by Southern whites.<ref name=\"curry\"/>\n\nWells-Barnett concluded that perhaps armed resistance was the only defense against lynching. Meanwhile, she extended her efforts to gain support of such powerful white nations as Britain to shame and sanction the racist practices of America.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Tommy J.|title=The Fortune of Wells: Ida B.

A prominent attorney, Barnett was a civil rights activist and journalist in Chicago. Like Wells, he spoke widely against lynchings and for the civil rights of African Americans. Wells and Barnett had met in 1893, working together on a pamphlet protesting the lack of Black representation at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893. Barnett founded ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the first Black newspaper in Chicago, in 1878. Wells began writing for the paper in 1893, later acquired a partial ownership interest, and after marrying Barnett, assumed the role of editor.\n\nWells' marriage to Barnett was a legal union as well as a partnership of ideas and actions. Both were journalists, and both were established activists with a shared commitment to civil rights. In an interview, Wells' daughter Alfreda said that the two had \"like interests\" and that their journalist careers were \"intertwined.\" This sort of close working relationship between a wife and husband was unusual at the time, as women often played more traditional domestic roles in a marriage.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

In the chapter of her ''Crusade For Justice'' autobiography called \"A Divided Duty,\" Wells described the difficulty she had splitting her time between her family and her work. She continued to work after the birth of her first child, traveling and bringing the infant Charles with her. Although she tried to balance her roles as a mother and as a national activist, she was not always successful. [[Susan B.

When he died in 1895, Wells was perhaps at the height of her notoriety, but many men and women were ambivalent or against a woman taking the lead in black civil rights at a time when women were not seen as, and often not allowed to be, leaders by the wider society.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=african+american+history+oxford#v=onepage&q=african%2520american%2520history%2520oxford&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass |last=Seymour Jr. |first= James B. |work=Well-Barnett, Ida |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780195167771 |editor-last=Finkelman |editor-first=Paul |volume=3 |page=333 |language=en}}</ref>  For the new leading voices, [[Booker T.

For example, there are differing in accounts for why Wells' name was excluded from the original list of founders of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. In his autobiography ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', Du Bois implied that Wells chose not to be included.<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 1940, p. 224.</ref> However, in her autobiography, Wells stated that Du Bois deliberately excluded her from the list.<ref>Duster (1970), ''Crusade for Justice'', p. 322.</ref>\n\n==Organizing in Chicago==\nHaving settled in Chicago, Wells continued her anti-lynching work while becoming more focused on the civil rights of African Americans. She worked with national civil rights leaders to protest a major exhibition, she was active in the national women's club movement, and she ultimately ran for the Illinois State Senate. She also was passionate about women\u2019s rights and suffrage. She was a spokeswomen and an advocate for women being successful in the workplace, having &nbsp;equal opportunities, and creating a name for themselves\n\n=== World's Columbian Exposition ===\nIn 1893, the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was held in Chicago. Together with [[Frederick Douglass]] and other black leaders, Wells organized a black boycott of the fair, for its exclusion of African Americans from the exhibits. Wells, Douglass, [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and Wells' future husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, wrote sections of the pamphlet ''The Reason Why: The Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition'', which detailed the progress of blacks since their arrival in America and also exposed the basis of Southern lynchings. Wells later reported to [[Albion W. Tourg\u00e9e]] that copies of the pamphlet had been distributed to more than 20,000 people at the fair.<sup>[44]</sup> That year she started work with ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the oldest African-American newspaper in the city.\n\n=== Women's Clubs ===\nLiving in Chicago in the late 19th century, Wells was very active in the national [[Woman's club movement]]. In 1893, she organized ''The Women's Era Club'', a first-of-its-kind civic club for African-American women in Chicago. It would later be renamed the Ida B. Wells Club in her honor.<sup>[46]</sup>  In 1896, Ida B. Wells took part in the meeting in Washington, D.C. that founded the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Association-of-Colored-Womens-Clubs|title=National Association of Colored Women\u2019s Clubs {{!}} Description, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> After Ms. Wells' death, the Ida B. Wells Club went on to do many things. The club advocated to have a housing project in Chicago named after the founder, Ida B. Wells, and succeeded, making history in 1939 as the first housing project named after a colored woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bpichicago.org/blog/honoring-ida-b-wells-with-chicagos-first-monument-to-an-african-american-woman/|title=Honoring Ida B.

Wells also helped organize the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Afro-American Council]].\n\nWells received much support from other social activists and her fellow club women. Frederick Douglass praised her work: \"You have done your people and mine a service ... What a revelation of existing conditions your writing has been for me.\"<sup>[49]</sup>\n\nDespite Douglass' praise, Wells was becoming a controversial figure among local and national women's clubs. This was evident when in 1899 the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs intended to meet in Chicago. Writing to the president of the association, Mary Terrell, Chicago organizers of the event stated that they would not cooperate in the meeting if it included Wells. When Wells learned that Terrell had agreed to exclude Wells, she called it \"a staggering blow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d3bRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Crusade+for+justice;+the+autobiography+of+Ida+B.+Wells%22#v=onepage&q=%22staggering%20blow%22&f=false|title=Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B.

Given her experience as a school teacher in segregated systems in the South, she wrote to the publisher on the failures of segregated school systems and the successes of integrated public schools. She then went to his office and lobbied him. Unsatisfied, she enlisted the social reformer [[Jane Addams]] in her cause. Wells and the pressure group she put together with Addams are credited with stopping the adoption of an officially segregated school system.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Worldliness of a Cosmopolitan Education: Passionate Lives in Public Service |last=Pinar |first=William F. |publisher=Routledge |pages=77\u201379|year=2009 |isbn=9781135844851}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture |last=Davies |first=Carole Boyce |authorlink=Carole Boyce Davies|publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=977|year=2008 |isbn=9781851097005 }}</ref>\n\n== Suffrage ==\n\n=== Willard controversy ===\nWells' role in the U.S. suffrage movement was inextricably linked to her lifelong crusade against racism, violence and discrimination towards African Americans. Her view of women's enfranchisement was pragmatic and political.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B. Wells-Barnett and American Reform, 1880\u20131930|last=Schechter|first=Patricia|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Like all suffragists she believed in women's right to vote, but she also saw enfranchisement as a way for black women to become politically involved in their communities and to use their votes to elect African Americans, regardless of gender, to influential political offices.\n\nAs a prominent black suffragist, Wells held strong positions against racism, violence and lynching that brought her into conflict with leaders of largely white suffrage organizations. Perhaps the most notable example of this conflict was her very public disagreement with [[Frances Willard]], the first President of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/willard-and-wells/introduction |title=Truth-Telling: Frances Willard and Ida B. Wells, Introduction |editor=Ella Wagner |display-editors=etal |date=March 14, 2019 |website=Frances Willard House Museum |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe WCTU was a predominantly white women's organization, with branches in every state and a growing membership. With roots in the call for temperance and sobriety, the organization later became a powerful advocate of suffrage in the U.S.\n\nIn 1893 Wells and Willard travelled separately to Britain on lecture tours. Willard was promoting temperance as well as suffrage for women, and Wells was calling attention to lynching in the U.S. The basis of their dispute was Wells' public statements that Willard was silent on the issue of lynching.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crusade for Justice|last=Duster|year=1970|isbn=|location=Chicago}} Chapters 18, 19 and 20.</ref> She referred to an interview Willard had conducted during her tour of the American South, in which she had blamed African Americans' behavior for the defeat of temperance legislation. \"The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,\" she had said, and \"the grog shop is its center of power. ... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.\"[63]\n\nAlthough Willard and her prominent supporter Lady Somerset attempted to limit press coverage of Wells' comments, newspapers in Britain in fact provided details of the dispute.\n\nWells also dedicated a chapter of her 1895 pamphlet ''A Red Record'' to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter titled \"Miss Willard's Attitude\" condemned Willard for using rhetoric that she thought promoted violence and other crimes against African Americans in America.\n\n=== Alpha Suffrage Club ===\nIn the years following her dispute with Willard, Wells continued her Anti- Lynching campaign and organizing in Chicago. She focused her work on black women's suffrage in the city following the enactment of a new state law enabling partial women's suffrage. The Illinois Presidential and Municipal Suffrage Bill of 1913 gave women in the state the right to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices; but not for governor, state representatives or members of Congress. Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi to give women these voting rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-per-flash-women-voter-0623-new-20130623-story.html|title=Illinois Women Win the Right To Vote|last=Grossman|first=Ron|date=June 23, 2013|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 17, 2018}}</ref>During the membership of Ida B.

In 1928, she tried to become a delegate to the Republican National Convention but lost to Oscar De Priest. Her feelings toward the Republican Party became more mixed due to the [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] Administration's stance on civil rights and attempts to promote a \"Lily-white\" policy in Southern Republican organizations. In 1930, Wells unsuccessfully sought elective office, running as an independent for a seat in the [[Illinois Senate]].<ref name=TE/> In her race, she lacked the support of Regular Republicans and De Priest, both of whom supported the winner of the seat, Adelbert Roberts.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n== Influence on black feminist activism ==\nAlthough not a feminist writer herself, Wells-Barnett tried to explain that the defense of white women's honor allowed Southern white men to get away with murder by projecting their own history of sexual violence onto black men.

Her reporting covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wells documented [[lynching in the United States]] through her indictment called \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases,\" investigating frequent claims of whites that lynchings were reserved for black criminals only. Wells exposed lynching as a barbaric practice of whites in the South used to intimidate and oppress African Americans who created economic and political competition\u2014and a subsequent threat of loss of power\u2014for whites. A white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses as her investigative reporting was carried nationally in black-owned newspapers.\n\nSubjected to continued threats, Wells left Memphis for [[Chicago]]. She married and had a family while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women's movement for the rest of her life. Wells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)|civil rights movement]] and the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].

Black economic progress was a contemporary issue in the South, and in many states whites worked to suppress black progress. In this period at the turn of the century, Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed laws and/or new constitutions to [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise most black people and many poor white people]] through use of [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]] and other devices. Wells-Barnett recommended that black people use arms to defend against lynching.<ref name=\"Southern Horrors\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14975/14975-h/14975-h.htm ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases''.]</ref>\n\nShe followed-up with greater research and detail in ''The Red Record'' (1895), a 100-page pamphlet describing lynching in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. It also covered black peoples' struggles in the South since the Civil War. ''The Red Record'' explored the alarmingly high rates of lynching in the United States (which was at a peak from 1880 to 1930). Wells-Barnett said that during Reconstruction, most Americans outside the South did not realize the growing rate of violence against black people in the South. She believed that during slavery, white people had not committed as many attacks because of the economic labour value of slaves. Wells noted that, since slavery time, \"ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, [through lynching] without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution.\"\n\n[[Frederick Douglass]] had written an article noting three eras of \"Southern barbarism\" and the excuses that whites claimed in each period.\n\nWells-Barnett explored these in detail in her ''The Red Record''.\n* During slavery time, she noted that whites worked to \"repress and stamp out alleged 'race riots{{'\"}} or suspected slave rebellions, usually killing black people in far higher proportions than any white casualties. Once the Civil War ended, white people feared black people, who were in the majority in many areas. White people acted to control them and suppress them by violence.\n* During the [[Reconstruction Era]] white people lynched black people as part of mob efforts to suppress black political activity and re-establish [[white supremacy]] after the war. They feared \"Negro Domination\" through voting and taking office. Wells-Barnett urged black people in high-risk areas to move away to protect their families.\n* She noted that whites frequently claimed that black men had \"to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women\". She noted that white people assumed that any relationship between a white woman and a black man was a result of rape. But, given power relationships, it was much more common for white men to take sexual advantage of poor black women. She stated: \"Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that black men rape white women.\" Wells connected lynching to sexual violence, showing how the myth of the black man's lust for white women led to murder of African-American men.\n\nWells-Barnett gave 14 pages of statistics related to lynching cases committed from 1892 to 1895; she also included pages of graphic accounts detailing specific lynchings. She notes that her data was taken from articles by white correspondents, white press bureaus, and white newspapers. ''The Red Record'' was a huge pamphlet, and had far-reaching influence in the debate about lynching. ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'' and ''The Red Record'''s accounts of these lynchings grabbed the attention of Northerners who knew little about lynching or accepted the common explanation that black men deserved this fate. Generally southern states and white juries refused to indict any perpetrators for lynching, although they were frequently known and sometimes shown in the photographs being made more frequently of such events.\n\nDespite Wells-Barnett's attempt to garner support among white Americans against lynching, she believed that her campaign could not overturn the economic interests whites had in using lynching as an instrument to maintain Southern order and discourage Black economic ventures. Ultimately, Wells-Barnett concluded that appealing to reason and compassion would not succeed in gaining criminalization of lynching by Southern whites.<ref name=\"curry\"/>\n\nWells-Barnett concluded that perhaps armed resistance was the only defense against lynching. Meanwhile, she extended her efforts to gain support of such powerful white nations as Britain to shame and sanction the racist practices of America.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Tommy J.|title=The Fortune of Wells: Ida B.

Wells began writing for the paper in 1893, later acquired a partial ownership interest, and after marrying Barnett, assumed the role of editor.\n\nWells' marriage to Barnett was a legal union as well as a partnership of ideas and actions. Both were journalists, and both were established activists with a shared commitment to civil rights. In an interview, Wells' daughter Alfreda said that the two had \"like interests\" and that their journalist careers were \"intertwined.\" This sort of close working relationship between a wife and husband was unusual at the time, as women often played more traditional domestic roles in a marriage.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

In the chapter of her ''Crusade For Justice'' autobiography called \"A Divided Duty,\" Wells described the difficulty she had splitting her time between her family and her work. She continued to work after the birth of her first child, traveling and bringing the infant Charles with her. Although she tried to balance her roles as a mother and as a national activist, she was not always successful. [[Susan B. Anthony]] said she seemed \"distracted.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tichi|first1=Cecelia|title=Civic Passions: Seven Who Launched Progressive America|date=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-0-8078-7191-1|page=340}}</ref>\n\n==African-American leadership==\nThe 19th century's acknowledged leader for African-American civil rights, [[Frederick Douglass]] praised Wells' work, giving her introductions and sometimes financial support for her investigations. When he died in 1895, Wells was perhaps at the height of her notoriety, but many men and women were ambivalent or against a woman taking the lead in black civil rights at a time when women were not seen as, and often not allowed to be, leaders by the wider society.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=african+american+history+oxford#v=onepage&q=african%2520american%2520history%2520oxford&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass |last=Seymour Jr. |first= James B. |work=Well-Barnett, Ida |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780195167771 |editor-last=Finkelman |editor-first=Paul |volume=3 |page=333 |language=en}}</ref>  For the new leading voices, [[Booker T.

For example, there are differing in accounts for why Wells' name was excluded from the original list of founders of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. In his autobiography ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', Du Bois implied that Wells chose not to be included.<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 1940, p. 224.</ref> However, in her autobiography, Wells stated that Du Bois deliberately excluded her from the list.<ref>Duster (1970), ''Crusade for Justice'', p. 322.</ref>\n\n==Organizing in Chicago==\nHaving settled in Chicago, Wells continued her anti-lynching work while becoming more focused on the civil rights of African Americans. She worked with national civil rights leaders to protest a major exhibition, she was active in the national women's club movement, and she ultimately ran for the Illinois State Senate. She also was passionate about women\u2019s rights and suffrage. She was a spokeswomen and an advocate for women being successful in the workplace, having &nbsp;equal opportunities, and creating a name for themselves\n\n=== World's Columbian Exposition ===\nIn 1893, the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was held in Chicago. Together with [[Frederick Douglass]] and other black leaders, Wells organized a black boycott of the fair, for its exclusion of African Americans from the exhibits. Wells, Douglass, [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and Wells' future husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, wrote sections of the pamphlet ''The Reason Why: The Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition'', which detailed the progress of blacks since their arrival in America and also exposed the basis of Southern lynchings. Wells later reported to [[Albion W. Tourg\u00e9e]] that copies of the pamphlet had been distributed to more than 20,000 people at the fair.<sup>[44]</sup> That year she started work with ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the oldest African-American newspaper in the city.\n\n=== Women's Clubs ===\nLiving in Chicago in the late 19th century, Wells was very active in the national [[Woman's club movement]]. In 1893, she organized ''The Women's Era Club'', a first-of-its-kind civic club for African-American women in Chicago. It would later be renamed the Ida B. Wells Club in her honor.<sup>[46]</sup>  In 1896, Ida B. Wells took part in the meeting in Washington, D.C. that founded the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Association-of-Colored-Womens-Clubs|title=National Association of Colored Women\u2019s Clubs {{!}} Description, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> After Ms. Wells' death, the Ida B. Wells Club went on to do many things. The club advocated to have a housing project in Chicago named after the founder, Ida B. Wells, and succeeded, making history in 1939 as the first housing project named after a colored woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bpichicago.org/blog/honoring-ida-b-wells-with-chicagos-first-monument-to-an-african-american-woman/|title=Honoring Ida B.

Wells also helped organize the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Afro-American Council]].\n\nWells received much support from other social activists and her fellow club women. Frederick Douglass praised her work: \"You have done your people and mine a service ... What a revelation of existing conditions your writing has been for me.\"<sup>[49]</sup>\n\nDespite Douglass' praise, Wells was becoming a controversial figure among local and national women's clubs. This was evident when in 1899 the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs intended to meet in Chicago. Writing to the president of the association, Mary Terrell, Chicago organizers of the event stated that they would not cooperate in the meeting if it included Wells. When Wells learned that Terrell had agreed to exclude Wells, she called it \"a staggering blow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d3bRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Crusade+for+justice;+the+autobiography+of+Ida+B.+Wells%22#v=onepage&q=%22staggering%20blow%22&f=false|title=Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B.

Given her experience as a school teacher in segregated systems in the South, she wrote to the publisher on the failures of segregated school systems and the successes of integrated public schools. She then went to his office and lobbied him. Unsatisfied, she enlisted the social reformer [[Jane Addams]] in her cause. Wells and the pressure group she put together with Addams are credited with stopping the adoption of an officially segregated school system.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Worldliness of a Cosmopolitan Education: Passionate Lives in Public Service |last=Pinar |first=William F. |publisher=Routledge |pages=77\u201379|year=2009 |isbn=9781135844851}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture |last=Davies |first=Carole Boyce |authorlink=Carole Boyce Davies|publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=977|year=2008 |isbn=9781851097005 }}</ref>\n\n== Suffrage ==\n\n=== Willard controversy ===\nWells' role in the U.S. suffrage movement was inextricably linked to her lifelong crusade against racism, violence and discrimination towards African Americans. Her view of women's enfranchisement was pragmatic and political.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B. Wells-Barnett and American Reform, 1880\u20131930|last=Schechter|first=Patricia|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Like all suffragists she believed in women's right to vote, but she also saw enfranchisement as a way for black women to become politically involved in their communities and to use their votes to elect African Americans, regardless of gender, to influential political offices.\n\nAs a prominent black suffragist, Wells held strong positions against racism, violence and lynching that brought her into conflict with leaders of largely white suffrage organizations. Perhaps the most notable example of this conflict was her very public disagreement with [[Frances Willard]], the first President of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/willard-and-wells/introduction |title=Truth-Telling: Frances Willard and Ida B. Wells, Introduction |editor=Ella Wagner |display-editors=etal |date=March 14, 2019 |website=Frances Willard House Museum |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe WCTU was a predominantly white women's organization, with branches in every state and a growing membership. With roots in the call for temperance and sobriety, the organization later became a powerful advocate of suffrage in the U.S.\n\nIn 1893 Wells and Willard travelled separately to Britain on lecture tours. Willard was promoting temperance as well as suffrage for women, and Wells was calling attention to lynching in the U.S. The basis of their dispute was Wells' public statements that Willard was silent on the issue of lynching.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crusade for Justice|last=Duster|year=1970|isbn=|location=Chicago}} Chapters 18, 19 and 20.</ref> She referred to an interview Willard had conducted during her tour of the American South, in which she had blamed African Americans' behavior for the defeat of temperance legislation. \"The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,\" she had said, and \"the grog shop is its center of power. ... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.\"[63]\n\nAlthough Willard and her prominent supporter Lady Somerset attempted to limit press coverage of Wells' comments, newspapers in Britain in fact provided details of the dispute.\n\nWells also dedicated a chapter of her 1895 pamphlet ''A Red Record'' to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter titled \"Miss Willard's Attitude\" condemned Willard for using rhetoric that she thought promoted violence and other crimes against African Americans in America.\n\n=== Alpha Suffrage Club ===\nIn the years following her dispute with Willard, Wells continued her Anti- Lynching campaign and organizing in Chicago. She focused her work on black women's suffrage in the city following the enactment of a new state law enabling partial women's suffrage. The Illinois Presidential and Municipal Suffrage Bill of 1913 gave women in the state the right to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices; but not for governor, state representatives or members of Congress. Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi to give women these voting rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-per-flash-women-voter-0623-new-20130623-story.html|title=Illinois Women Win the Right To Vote|last=Grossman|first=Ron|date=June 23, 2013|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 17, 2018}}</ref>During the membership of Ida B.

In 1928, she tried to become a delegate to the Republican National Convention but lost to Oscar De Priest. Her feelings toward the Republican Party became more mixed due to the [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] Administration's stance on civil rights and attempts to promote a \"Lily-white\" policy in Southern Republican organizations. In 1930, Wells unsuccessfully sought elective office, running as an independent for a seat in the [[Illinois Senate]].<ref name=TE/> In her race, she lacked the support of Regular Republicans and De Priest, both of whom supported the winner of the seat, Adelbert Roberts.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n== Influence on black feminist activism ==\nAlthough not a feminist writer herself, Wells-Barnett tried to explain that the defense of white women's honor allowed Southern white men to get away with murder by projecting their own history of sexual violence onto black men. Her call for all races and genders to be accountable for their actions showed African-American women that they can speak out and fight for their rights. By portraying the horrors of lynching, she worked to show that racial and gender discrimination are linked, furthering the black feminist cause.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|last1=Stansell|first1=Christine|title=The Feminist Promise|date=2010|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|page=126<!--|pages=128-->}}</ref>\n\n== Autobiography and death ==\nWells began writing her autobiography, ''Crusade for Justice'' (1928), but never finished the book; it would be posthumously published, edited by her daughter Alfreda, in 1970, as ''Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B.
