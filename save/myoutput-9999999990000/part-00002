The protagonist is instructed by Pedro, a floating sentient banana that Mitch is an arms dealer and must be eliminated. Upon escaping the butchery and killing Mitch, the protagonist heads to the district Null, an abandoned community project now home to a man named Denny and his army of bounty hunters. When confronting Denny he flees but reveals that his Sister Ophelia controls the Internet. The protagonist deals with Denny and heads via the sewers to confront Ophelia. After defeating Ophelia, it is revealed that the protagonist has been systematically killing his own family: with Mitch being his father, Denny his brother and Ophelia his sister. Pedro reveals to the player that the protagonist knocked himself unconscious and erased his memory so that he can eliminate his family without guilt. Upon revealing this, Pedro jams itself into the protagonist's ear and tried to have him shoot himself. The final battle is a visual representation of the protagonist's mental struggle to resist Pedro's influence. With Pedro defeated, the protagonist removes his mask, revealing that he was Pedro all along with the banana being nothing but a figment of his imagination. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyO7ZiIzTrY</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n''My Friend Pedro'' started development in February 2015 \"on and off\"<ref name=\"Deadtoast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.deadtoast.com/blog/?p=368 |title=My Friend Perdo: Blood Bullets Bananas |author=Victor |date=21 November 2015 |website=DeadToast |access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref> until indirectly announcing that development would be in full swing on December 4, 2015 in a devlog. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadtoast.com/blog/?p=379 |title=DevLog Entry #4 |author=Victor |date=4 December 2015 |website=DeadToast |access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref> It had been announced that it was in the pre-alpha stage of development on November 21, 2015 aimed to release on PC and \"eventually\" Macintosh computers.<ref name=\"Deadtoast\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = NS: 78/100<ref name=\"MC_NS\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/my-friend-pedro |title=My Friend Pedro for Switch Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref><br />PC:<br> 81/100<ref name=\"MC_PC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/my-friend-pedro |title=My Friend Pedro for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref><br />XONE: 76/100<ref name=\"MC_XONE\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/my-friend-pedro |title=My Friend Pedro for Xbox One Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref><br/>PS4: 71/100<ref name=\"MC_PS4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/my-friend-pedro|title=My Friend Pedro for PlayStation 4 Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''My Friend Pedro'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MC_PC\" /><ref name=\"MC_NS\" /> ''[[IGN]]{{'s}} Mitchell Saltzman reviewed it with an 8.5/10 score, saying it \"simply feels great to play\", while noting that the campaign has little replay value.<ref name=\"ign\">{{Cite web| title = My Friend Pedro Review - IGN| first = Mitchell | last = Saltzman| work = IGN| date = June 20, 2019| access-date = December 20, 2019| url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review}}</ref>\n\nThe game was nominated for \"Fresh Indie Game\" with DeadToast Entertainment at [[The Game Awards 2019]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2019-nominees-full-list/1100-6471564/ |title=The Game Awards 2019 Nominees Full List |first=Jeremy |last=Winslow |date=19 November 2019 |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://myfriendpedro.com/}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:2019 video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Organized crime video games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Devolver Digital games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=June 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = My Friend Pedro\n| image = My_Friend_Pedro.jpg\n| developer = DeadToast Entertainment\n| publisher = [[Devolver Digital]]\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = {{Unbulleted list|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[Nintendo Switch]]|[[Xbox One]]|[[PlayStation 4]]}}\n| released = {{Unbulleted list|'''Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch'''|20 June 2019|'''Xbox One'''|5 December 2019<ref>https://twitter.com/deadtoast_com/status/1195095947027656704</ref>|'''PlayStation 4'''|2 April 2020}}\n| genre = [[Shoot 'em up]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''''My Friend Pedro''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] video game developed by DeadToast Entertainment and published by [[Devolver Digital]].
