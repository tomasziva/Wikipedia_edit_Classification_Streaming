Males tended to have larger wings than females, and were heavier than females, on average. Both males and females had similar thorax dimensions (wing muscles are contained in the thorax). Female monarchs tended to have thicker wings, which is thought to convey greater tensile strength. This would make female wings less likely to be damaged during migration. Also, females had lower wing loading than males ([[wing loading]] is a value derived from the ratio of wing size to body mass), which would mean females require less energy to fly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2015/11/03/New-study-just-published-describing-why-female-monarchs-are-better-fliers |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=3 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:String of Monarchs, Pismo Preserve.jpg|thumb|350px|String of monarchs wintering at the [[Pismo State Beach]] Monarch Preserve, 2015]]\nThe range of the western and eastern populations of ''D. plexippus plexippus'' expands and contracts depending upon the season.

Overwintering, roosting butterflies have been seen on basswoods, elms, sumacs, locusts, oaks, osage-oranges, mulberries, pecans, willows, cottonwoods, and mesquites.<ref name=\"Robert Michael Pyle\"/> While breeding, monarch habitats can be found in agricultural fields, pasture land, prairie remnants, urban and suburban residential areas, gardens, trees, and roadsides \u2013 anywhere where there is access to larval host plants.<ref name=\"Sue Halpern\"/> Habitat restoration is a primary goal in monarch conservation efforts. Habitat requirements change during migration. During the fall migration, butterflies must have access to nectar-producing plants. During the spring migration, butterflies must have access to larval food plants and nectar plants.\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\nThe monarch butterfly undergoes four stages of complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]:\n\n=== Eggs ===\n\nThe eggs are derived from materials ingested as a larva and from the [[spermatophore]]s received from males during mating.<ref name=o3>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 3</ref> Eggs are laid singly on the underside of a young leaf of a milkweed plant during the spring and summer months.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> The eggs are cream colored or light green, ovate to conical in shape, and about 1.2\u00d70.9&nbsp;mm in size. The eggs weigh less than 0.5&nbsp;mg each and have raised ridges that form longitudinally from the point to apex to the base. Though each egg is {{frac|1|1000}} the mass of the female, she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs.<ref name=o3/> The number of eggs laid by a female, who may mate several times, ranges from 290 to 1180.<ref name=o23>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 23</ref> Females lay their eggs on the underside of the milkweed leaves; the offspring's consumption of the milkweed benefits health and helps defend them against predators.<ref name=\"T. Lefevre\"/><ref name=\"Jaap de Roode\"/> Eggs take 3 to 8 days to develop and hatch into larva or [[caterpillar]]s.<ref name=\"Xerces Society\"/>{{rp|(p21)}} Monarchs will lay eggs along the southern migration route.<ref name=o51>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Larvae ===\n\nThe caterpillar goes through five major, distinct stages of growth and after each one, it [[molt]]s. Each caterpillar, or [[instar]], that molts is larger than the previous as it eats and stores energy in the form of fat and nutrients to carry it through the nonfeeding pupal stage. Each instar usually lasts about 3 to 5 days, depending on various factors such as temperature and food availability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Vertical Caterpillar 2000px.jpg|thumb|upright|Fifth instar with the white spots visible on the prolegs]]\n\n'''The first instar''' caterpillar that emerges out of the egg is pale green and translucent. It lacks banding coloration or tentacles. The larvae or caterpillar eats its egg case and begins to feed on [[milkweed]]. It is during this stage of growth that the caterpillar begins to sequester [[cardenolide]]s. The circular motion a caterpillar uses while eating milkweed prevents the flow of [[latex]] that could entrap it. The first instar is usually between 2 and 6S&nbsp;mm long.\n\n'''The second instar''' larva develops a characteristic pattern of white, yellow and black transverse bands. It is no longer translucent but is covered in short [[setae]]. Pairs of black tentacles begin to grow. One pair grows on the thorax and another pair on the abdomen. Like the first instar, second instar larvae usually eat holes in the middle of the leaf, rather than at the edges. The second instar is usually between 6&nbsp;mm and 1&nbsp;cm long.\n\n'''The third instar''' larva has more distinct bands and the two pairs of tentacles become longer. Legs on the thorax differentiate into a smaller pair near the head and larger pairs further back. These third-stage caterpillars begin to eat along the leaf edges. The third instar is usually between 1 and 1.5&nbsp;cm long.\n\n'''The fourth instar''' has a different banding pattern. It develops white spots on the [[proleg]]s near the back of the caterpillar. It is usually between 1.5 and 2.5&nbsp;cm long.\n\n'''The fifth instar''' larva has a more complex banding pattern and white dots on the prolegs, with front legs that are small and very close to the head. A caterpillar at this stage has an enormous appetite, being able to consume a large milkweed leaf in a day. Its length ranges from 2.5 to 4.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Swallowtail Caterpillar, Monarch Caterpillar & Queen Caterpillar in Florida (27224446333).jpg|thumb|upright|{{clarify|text=Size comparison between|date=April 2020}} a monarch caterpillar, a [[queen (butterfly)|queen caterpillar]] and a [[black swallowtail|black swallowtail caterpillar]]]]\n\nAt this stage of development, it is relatively large compared to the earlier instars. The caterpillar completes its growth. At this point, it is 4.5&nbsp;cm long (large specimens can reach 5&nbsp;cm) and 7 to 8&nbsp;mm wide, and weighs about 1.5&nbsp;grams. This can be compared to the first instar, which was 2 to 6&nbsp;mm long and 0.5 to 1.5&nbsp;mm wide. Fifth-instar larvae increase in weight 2000 times from first instars. Fifth-stage instar larva can chew through the petiole or midrib of milkweed leaves and stop the flow of latex. After this, they eat more leaf tissue. Before pupation, larvae must consume milkweed to increase their mass. Larvae stop feeding and search for a pupation site.\n\n=== Pupa ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Danaus plexippus emerging from chrysalis 04.jpg|thumb|upright=0.66|Adult monarch emerges from its [[chrysalis]] shell]]\nTo prepare for the [[pupa]] or [[chrysalis]] stage, the caterpillar chooses a safe place for pupation, where it spins a silk pad on a downward-facing horizontal surface. At this point, it turns around and securely latches on with its last pair of hindlegs and hangs upside down, in the form of the letter J. After \"J-hanging\" for about 12\u201316 hours, it will suddenly straighten out its body and go into [[peristalsis]] some seconds before its skin splits behind its head. It then sheds its skin over a period of a few minutes, revealing a green chrysalis. At first, the chrysalis is long, soft, and somewhat amorphous, but over a few hours it compacts into its distinct shape \u2013 an opaque, pale-green chrysalis with small golden dots near the bottom, and a gold-and-black rim around the dorsal side near the top. At first, its exoskeleton is soft and fragile, but it hardens and becomes more durable within about a day. At this point, it is about 2.5&nbsp;cm (1\") long and 10\u201312&nbsp;mm (3/8\u20137/16\") wide, weighing about 1.2&nbsp;grams. At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8\u201315 days (usually 11\u201312 days). During this pupal stage, the adult butterfly forms inside. Within a day or so before emerging is due, the exoskeleton first becomes translucent and the chrysalis more bluish. Finally, within 12 hours or so, it becomes transparent, revealing the black and orange colors of the butterfly inside before it [[Eclosion|ecloses]] (emerges).\n\n=== Adult ===\n\nAn adult butterfly emerges after about two weeks as a chrysalis, and hangs upside down for a few hours until its wings are dry. Fluids are pumped into the wings, and they expand, dry, and stiffen. The monarch expands and retracts its wings, and once conditions allow, it then flies and feeds on a variety of nectar plants. During the breeding season adults reach sexual maturity in four or five days. However, the migrating generation does not reach maturity until overwintering is complete.<ref name=\"monarchlab.org\"/> Monarchs typically live for two to five weeks during their breeding season.<ref name=\"Xerces Society\"/>{{rp|(pp22-23)}} Larvae growing in high densities are smaller, have lower survival, and weigh less as adults compared with those growing in lower densities.<ref name=\"D.T. Flockhart\"/> Monarch metamorphosis from egg to adult occurs during the warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During the development, both larvae and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive.<ref name=\"Xerces Society\"/>{{rp|(pp21-22)}} However, this is a natural attrition rate for most butterflies, since they are low on the food chain.\n\n==== Reproduction ====\n[[File:Monarch butterfly mating.webm|thumb|Monarch butterfly mating]]\n\nHealthy males are more likely to mate than unhealthy ones. Females and males typically mate more than once. Females that mate several times lay more eggs.<ref name=\":1\"/> Mating for the overwintering populations occurs in the spring, prior to dispersion. Mating is less dependent on pheromones than other species in its genus.<ref name=\"animaldiversity1\"/> Male search and capture strategies may influence copulatory success, and human-induced changes to the habitat can influence monarch mating activity at overwintering sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Solensky|first=Michelle J.|date=November 2004|title=The Effect of Behavior and Ecology on Male Mating Success in Overwintering Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus)|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|volume=17|issue=6|pages=723\u2013743|doi=10.1023/b:joir.0000048985.58159.0d|issn=0892-7553}}</ref>\n\nCourtship occurs in two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the butterflies copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes.<ref name=\"Emmel, Thomas C.\"/> Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females may be able to avoid mating, though some have more success than others.<ref name=\":37\"/><ref name=\":38\"/> During copulation, a male transfers his [[spermatophore]] to a female. Along with [[sperm]], the spermatophore provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in egg laying. An increase in spermatophore size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that produce larger spermatophores also fertilize more females' eggs.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\n=== Pictorial life cycle ===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Danaus plexippus, Monarch egg.jpg|Egg\nFile:Monarch

Homeowners often raise monarchs in plastic or glass containers in their kitchens, basements, porches, etc., and under artificial lighting and controlled temperatures. Such conditions would not mimic what the monarchs are used to in the wild, and may result in adult monarchs that are unsuited for the realities of their wild existence.

The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of [[apostatic selection]] (i.e., the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of [[camouflage]] (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stimson |first=John |author2=Mark Berman |year=1990 |title= Predator induced colour polymorphism in Danaus plexippus L.

In [[Homeric Greek]], his name means \"one who urges on horses\", i.e., \"rider\" or \"[[chariot]]eer\". In the 10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'', at the bottom of page 467,<ref name=\"Linnaeus, C. (1758)\"/> Linnaeus wrote that the names of the ''Danai festivi'', the division of the genus to which ''Papilio plexippus'' belonged, were derived from the sons of Aegyptus. Linnaeus divided his large genus ''Papilio'', containing all known butterfly species, into what we would now call subgenera. The ''Danai festivi'' formed one of the \"subgenera\", containing colorful species, as opposed to the ''Danai candidi'', containing species with bright white wings. Linnaeus wrote: \"{{lang|la|Danaorum Candidorum nomina a filiabus Danai Aegypti, Festivorum a filiis mutuatus sunt.}}\" (English: \"The names of the ''Danai candidi'' have been derived from the daughters of Danaus, those of the ''Danai festivi'' from the sons of Aegyptus.\")\n\nRobert Michael Pyle suggested ''Danaus'' is a masculinized version of [[Dana\u00eb]] (Greek {{wikt-lang|grc|\u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b7}}), Danaus's great-great-granddaughter, to whom Zeus came as a shower of gold, which seemed to him a more appropriate source for the name of this butterfly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pyle |first=Robert Michael |title=Chasing Monarchs: Migrating with the Butterflies of Passage |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gO9eXQI0ZxQC&pg=PA148|year=2001 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books |isbn=978-0-618-12743-6 |pages=148\u2013149 }}</ref>\n\nThere are three species of monarch butterflies:\n* ''D. plexippus'', described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the species known most commonly as the monarch butterfly of North America. Its range actually extends worldwide and can be found in Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and the [[Pacific Islands]].\n* ''[[Danaus erippus|D. erippus]]'', the southern monarch, was described by [[Pieter Cramer]] in 1775. This species is found in tropical and subtropical latitudes of South America, mainly in Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and southern Peru. The South American monarch and the North American monarch may have been one species at one time. Some researchers believe the southern monarch separated from the monarch's population some 2 [[mya (unit)|mya]], at the end of the [[Pliocene]]. [[Sea level]]s were higher, and the entire [[Amazon River|Amazonas]] lowland was a vast expanse of [[brackish]] swamp that offered limited butterfly habitat.<ref name=smith/>\n* ''[[Danaus cleophile|D. cleophile]]'', the Jamaican monarch, described by [[Jean Baptiste Godart]] in 1819, ranges from [[Jamaica]] to [[Hispaniola]].<ref name=\"IUCN\"/>\n\nSix subspecies and two color morphs of ''D. plexippus'' have been identified:<ref name=\"nic.funet.fi\"/>\n* ''D. p. plexippus'' \u2013 nominate subspecies, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the migratory subspecies known from most of North America.\n** ''D. p. p.'' form ''nivosus'', the white monarch commonly found on [[Oahu]], Hawaii, and rarely in other locations.<ref name=\"Lawrence Gibbs\"/>\n** ''D. p. p.''

Males tended to have larger wings than females, and were heavier than females, on average. Both males and females had similar thorax dimensions (wing muscles are contained in the thorax). Female monarchs tended to have thicker wings, which is thought to convey greater tensile strength. This would make female wings less likely to be damaged during migration. Also, females had lower wing loading than males ([[wing loading]] is a value derived from the ratio of wing size to body mass), which would mean females require less energy to fly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2015/11/03/New-study-just-published-describing-why-female-monarchs-are-better-fliers |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=3 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:String of Monarchs, Pismo Preserve.jpg|thumb|350px|String of monarchs wintering at the [[Pismo State Beach]] Monarch Preserve, 2015]]\nThe range of the western and eastern populations of ''D. plexippus plexippus'' expands and contracts depending upon the season.

Overwintering, roosting butterflies have been seen on basswoods, elms, sumacs, locusts, oaks, osage-oranges, mulberries, pecans, willows, cottonwoods, and mesquites.<ref name=\"Robert Michael Pyle\"/> While breeding, monarch habitats can be found in agricultural fields, pasture land, prairie remnants, urban and suburban residential areas, gardens, trees, and roadsides \u2013 anywhere where there is access to larval host plants.<ref name=\"Sue Halpern\"/> Habitat restoration is a primary goal in monarch conservation efforts. Habitat requirements change during migration. During the fall migration, butterflies must have access to nectar-producing plants. During the spring migration, butterflies must have access to larval food plants and nectar plants.\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\nThe monarch butterfly undergoes four stages of complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]:\n\n=== Eggs ===\n\nThe eggs are derived from materials ingested as a larva and from the [[spermatophore]]s received from males during mating.<ref name=o3>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 3</ref> Eggs are laid singly on the underside of a young leaf of a milkweed plant during the spring and summer months.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> The eggs are cream colored or light green, ovate to conical in shape, and about 1.2\u00d70.9&nbsp;mm in size. The eggs weigh less than 0.5&nbsp;mg each and have raised ridges that form longitudinally from the point to apex to the base. Though each egg is {{frac|1|1000}} the mass of the female, she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs.<ref name=o3/> The number of eggs laid by a female, who may mate several times, ranges from 290 to 1180.<ref name=o23>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 23</ref> Females lay their eggs on the underside of the milkweed leaves; the offspring's consumption of the milkweed benefits health and helps defend them against predators.<ref name=\"T. Lefevre\"/><ref name=\"Jaap de Roode\"/> Eggs take 3 to 8 days to develop and hatch into larva or [[caterpillar]]s.<ref name=\"Xerces Society\"/>{{rp|(p21)}} Monarchs will lay eggs along the southern migration route.<ref name=o51>[[#Oberhauser2004|Oberhauser (2004)]], p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Larvae ===\n\nThe caterpillar goes through five major, distinct stages of growth and after each one, it [[molt]]s. Each caterpillar, or [[instar]], that molts is larger than the previous as it eats and stores energy in the form of fat and nutrients to carry it through the nonfeeding pupal stage. Each instar usually lasts about 3 to 5 days, depending on various factors such as temperature and food availability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Vertical Caterpillar 2000px.jpg|thumb|upright|Fifth instar with the white spots visible on the prolegs]]\n\n'''The first instar''' caterpillar that emerges out of the egg is pale green and translucent. It lacks banding coloration or tentacles. The larvae or caterpillar eats its egg case and begins to feed on [[milkweed]]. It is during this stage of growth that the caterpillar begins to sequester [[cardenolide]]s. The circular motion a caterpillar uses while eating milkweed prevents the flow of [[latex]] that could entrap it. The first instar is usually between 2 and 6S&nbsp;mm long.\n\n'''The second instar''' larva develops a characteristic pattern of white, yellow and black transverse bands. It is no longer translucent but is covered in short [[setae]]. Pairs of black tentacles begin to grow. One pair grows on the thorax and another pair on the abdomen. Like the first instar, second instar larvae usually eat holes in the middle of the leaf, rather than at the edges. The second instar is usually between 6&nbsp;mm and 1&nbsp;cm long.\n\n'''The third instar''' larva has more distinct bands and the two pairs of tentacles become longer. Legs on the thorax differentiate into a smaller pair near the head and larger pairs further back. These third-stage caterpillars begin to eat along the leaf edges. The third instar is usually between 1 and 1.5&nbsp;cm long.\n\n'''The fourth instar''' has a different banding pattern. It develops white spots on the [[proleg]]s near the back of the caterpillar. It is usually between 1.5 and 2.5&nbsp;cm long.\n\n'''The fifth instar''' larva has a more complex banding pattern and white dots on the prolegs, with front legs that are small and very close to the head. A caterpillar at this stage has an enormous appetite, being able to consume a large milkweed leaf in a day. Its length ranges from 2.5 to 4.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Swallowtail Caterpillar, Monarch Caterpillar & Queen Caterpillar in Florida (27224446333).jpg|thumb|upright|{{clarify|text=Size comparison between|date=April 2020}} a monarch caterpillar, a [[queen (butterfly)|queen caterpillar]] and a [[black swallowtail|black swallowtail caterpillar]]]]\n\nAt this stage of development, it is relatively large compared to the earlier instars. The caterpillar completes its growth. At this point, it is 4.5&nbsp;cm long (large specimens can reach 5&nbsp;cm) and 7 to 8&nbsp;mm wide, and weighs about 1.5&nbsp;grams. This can be compared to the first instar, which was 2 to 6&nbsp;mm long and 0.5 to 1.5&nbsp;mm wide. Fifth-instar larvae increase in weight 2000 times from first instars. Fifth-stage instar larva can chew through the petiole or midrib of milkweed leaves and stop the flow of latex. After this, they eat more leaf tissue. Before pupation, larvae must consume milkweed to increase their mass. Larvae stop feeding and search for a pupation site.\n\n=== Pupa ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Danaus plexippus emerging from chrysalis 04.jpg|thumb|upright=0.66|Adult monarch emerges from its [[chrysalis]] shell]]\nTo prepare for the [[pupa]] or [[chrysalis]] stage, the caterpillar chooses a safe place for pupation, where it spins a silk pad on a downward-facing horizontal surface. At this point, it turns around and securely latches on with its last pair of hindlegs and hangs upside down, in the form of the letter J. After \"J-hanging\" for about 12\u201316 hours, it will suddenly straighten out its body and go into [[peristalsis]] some seconds before its skin splits behind its head. It then sheds its skin over a period of a few minutes, revealing a green chrysalis. At first, the chrysalis is long, soft, and somewhat amorphous, but over a few hours it compacts into its distinct shape \u2013 an opaque, pale-green chrysalis with small golden dots near the bottom, and a gold-and-black rim around the dorsal side near the top. At first, its exoskeleton is soft and fragile, but it hardens and becomes more durable within about a day. At this point, it is about 2.5&nbsp;cm (1\") long and 10\u201312&nbsp;mm (3/8\u20137/16\") wide, weighing about 1.2&nbsp;grams. At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8\u201315 days (usually 11\u201312 days). During this pupal stage, the adult butterfly forms inside. Within a day or so before emerging is due, the exoskeleton first becomes translucent and the chrysalis more bluish. Finally, within 12 hours or so, it becomes transparent, revealing the black and orange colors of the butterfly inside before it [[Eclosion|ecloses]] (emerges).\n\n=== Adult ===\n\nAn adult butterfly emerges after about two weeks as a chrysalis, and hangs upside down for a few hours until its wings are dry. Fluids are pumped into the wings, and they expand, dry, and stiffen. The monarch expands and retracts its wings, and once conditions allow, it then flies and feeds on a variety of nectar plants. During the breeding season adults reach sexual maturity in four or five days. However, the migrating generation does not reach maturity until overwintering is complete.<ref name=\"monarchlab.org\"/> Monarchs typically live for two to five weeks during their breeding season.<ref name=\"Xerces Society\"/>{{rp|(pp22-23)}} Larvae growing in high densities are smaller, have lower survival, and weigh less as adults compared with those growing in lower densities.<ref name=\"D.T. Flockhart\"/> Monarch metamorphosis from egg to adult occurs during the warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During the development, both larvae and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive.<ref name=\"Xerces Society\"/>{{rp|(pp21-22)}} However, this is a natural attrition rate for most butterflies, since they are low on the food chain.\n\n==== Reproduction ====\n[[File:Monarch butterfly mating.webm|thumb|Monarch butterfly mating]]\n\nHealthy males are more likely to mate than unhealthy ones. Females and males typically mate more than once. Females that mate several times lay more eggs.<ref name=\":1\"/> Mating for the overwintering populations occurs in the spring, prior to dispersion. Mating is less dependent on pheromones than other species in its genus.<ref name=\"animaldiversity1\"/> Male search and capture strategies may influence copulatory success, and human-induced changes to the habitat can influence monarch mating activity at overwintering sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Solensky|first=Michelle J.|date=November 2004|title=The Effect of Behavior and Ecology on Male Mating Success in Overwintering Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus)|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|volume=17|issue=6|pages=723\u2013743|doi=10.1023/b:joir.0000048985.58159.0d|issn=0892-7553}}</ref>\n\nCourtship occurs in two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the butterflies copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes.<ref name=\"Emmel, Thomas C.\"/> Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females may be able to avoid mating, though some have more success than others.<ref name=\":37\"/><ref name=\":38\"/> During copulation, a male transfers his [[spermatophore]] to a female. Along with [[sperm]], the spermatophore provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in egg laying. An increase in spermatophore size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that produce larger spermatophores also fertilize more females' eggs.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\n=== Pictorial life cycle ===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Danaus plexippus, Monarch egg.jpg|Egg\nFile:Monarch

This parasite can rapidly build up in captive monarchs, especially if they are housed together. The spores of the parasite also can quickly contaminate all housing equipment, so that all subsequent monarchs reared in the same containers then become infected. One researcher stated that rearing more than 100 monarchs constitutes \"mass-rearing\" and should not be done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akdavis6.wixsite.com/monarchscience/single-post/2015/09/07/What-everyone-needs-to-know-about-rearing-monarchs-from-a-science-standpoint |title=monarchscience |publisher=Akdavis6.wixsite.com |date=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the disease risks, researchers believe these captive-reared monarchs are not as fit as wild ones, owing to the unnatural conditions they are raised in. Homeowners often raise monarchs in plastic or glass containers in their kitchens, basements, porches, etc., and under artificial lighting and controlled temperatures. Such conditions would not mimic what the monarchs are used to in the wild, and may result in adult monarchs that are unsuited for the realities of their wild existence.

These spores are passed, from [[vertical transmission|female to caterpillar]], when spores rub off during egg laying and are then ingested by caterpillars.
