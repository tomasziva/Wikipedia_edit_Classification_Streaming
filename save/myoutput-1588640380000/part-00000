While fusilier is derived from the 17th-century [[French language|French]] word ''fusil'' \u2013 meaning a type of [[flintlock]] [[musket]] \u2013 the term has been used in contrasting ways in different countries and at different times, including soldiers guarding [[artillery]], various [[special forces|elite units]], ordinary [[line infantry]] and other uses.\n\n== Derivation of the word ==\nThe word ''fusil'', which was the name of the type of musket carried by a fusilier, is itself derived from the Old French and Latin ''foisil'' , meaning a piece of flint.<ref>[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Godefroy|Godefroy, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric]], ''Dictionnaire de l'ancienne langue fran\u00e7aise et de tous ses dialectes du IX<sup>e</sup> au XV<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle (1881)''([http://micmap.org/dicfro/search/dictionnaire-godefroy/foisil foisil])</ref> In the Waray language (a dialect spoken by the Waray people of Eastern Leyte, Biliran island and Western Samar located in the Visayan islands of the Philippines), the word for gun or using a gun is also called \"pusil\", this may be a corruption of the French term.<ref> ([https://glosbe.com/war/tl/pusil])</ref> What is more likely is that their use of \"pusil\" is derived from the old Spanish word for gun, \"fusil\". Spain was the colonial power occupying the Philippines for centuries and Waray speakers have difficulty pronouncing the letter \"f\" so it is usually given the sound of a \"p\" thus fusil perhaps became pusil.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Fus. Urwin and Eastwood 2, AHD, 5-19-07.jpg|thumb|[[historical reenactment|Reenactor]]s in the uniform of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] (23rd Regiment of Foot), one of the first British fusilier units]]\n[[Flintlock]] small arms were first used militarily during the early 17th century. Flintlocks, at the time, were more reliable and safer to use than [[matchlock]] muskets, which required a [[match]] to be lit near the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] before the weapon could be triggered. By contrast, flintlocks were fired using a piece of [[flint]]. By the time of the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131652), one flintlock musket, the [[snaphance]], was in common use in Britain.\n\nThe term ''fusiliers'' was first used officially by the [[French Army]] in 1670, when four fusiliers were distributed among each [[company (military unit)|company]] of infantry.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Cathal J. Nolan, 2008, ''Wars of the Age of Louis XIV'', 1650\u20131715'', Westport, Conn.; Greenwood Press, p168.</ref> The following year the ''Fusiliers du Roi'' (\"King's Fusiliers\"), the first [[regiment]] composed primarily of soldiers with flintlocks, was formed<ref name=\"Nolan\"/> by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].\n\nGuarding and escorting [[artillery]] pieces was the first task assigned to the ''Fusiliers du Roi'': flintlocks were especially useful around [[field artillery]], as they were less likely than matchlocks to accidentally ignite open barrels of [[gunpowder]], required at the time to load [[cannon]]s.<ref name=\"Nolan\"/> At the time, artillery units also required guards to maintain discipline amongst civilian [[drayman|draymen]].<ref name=\"barnes\">{{cite book |title=A History of the Regiments and Uniforms of the British Army |last=Barnes |first=R M |year=1972 |publisher=Sphere Books |location= |isbn= |page=28}}</ref> Hence the term fusilier became strongly associated with the role of guarding artillery in Britain and the English-speaking world,<ref name=\"barnes\"/> especially after the formation of the first official \"Fusilier\" units, during the 1680s. As late as the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756-63, the Austrian Army maintained an Artillery Fusilier Regiment for the exclusive roles of providing support for field batteries on the battlefield and of protecting the artillery when on the march and in camp.<ref>{{cite book|first=J.|last=Braithwaite|page=24|title=Uniforms of the Seven Years' War Austria|ISBN=0-904555-01-1}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 18th century, as flintlocks became the main weapon used by infantry, the term fusilier gradually ceased to have this meaning and was applied to various units.<ref name=\"Nolan\"/>\n\n==Fusiliers by country==\n===Belgium===\nThe [[Belgian Army]] has no specific regiment called fusiliers, but the general denomination for infantry soldiers is ''Storm fusilier'' ({{lang-nl|stormfuselier}}; {{lang-fr|fusilier d'assaut}}).\n\nThe [[Belgian Navy]] used to have a regiment of marine infantry composed of ''marine fusiliers'' in charge of the protection of the naval bases. However this unit was disbanded in the 1990s reforms.\n\n===Brazil===\nAdopting a number of practices from the Portuguese military in the 19th century, the [[Brazilian Army]] uses the term ''fuzileiros'' (fusiliers) to designate the regular line infantry, as opposed to the [[grenadiers]] (''granadeiros'') and the light infantry (''ca\u00e7adores'' and ''atiradores''). In addition, the [[Brazilian Marine Corps]] is called ''Fuzileiros Navais'' (Naval Fusiliers).\n\n===Canada===\nThere are five fusilier regiments patterned on the British tradition forming part of the [[Canadian Militia]], and later the [[Canadian Army]]. The [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]], although not fusiliers, wears fusilier ceremonial uniform with scarlet plumes because of its alliance with the Royal Welch Fusiliers.\n\nThe five Canadian fusilier regiments are:\n*[[The Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada]] (which wears Highland uniform, but with white fusilier hackles on [[balmoral bonnet]]s)\n*[[Les Fusiliers du St-Laurent|Les Fusiliers du S<sup>t</sup>-Laurent]], white plume\n*[[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]], white plume\n*[[The Princess Louise Fusiliers]] (which wear a grey hackle as a token of their alliance with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, now part of the Royal Irish Regiment)\n*[[Les Fusiliers de Sherbrooke]], white plume\n\nThe [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]] were known as 1st Regiment \"Prince of Wales' Fusiliers\" before 1911.\n\n===France===\n[[Image:1er RFM flag guard Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The flag of the 1st Regiment of [[Fusiliers Marins|Naval Fusiliers]] at the 2008 [[Bastille Day Military Parade]]]]\nBy the mid-18th century, the [[French Army]] used the term ''fusiliers'' to designate ordinary [[line infantry]], as opposed to specialist or \u00e9lite infantry, such as ''[[grenadier]]s'', ''[[voltigeur]]s'', ''[[carabinier]]s'' or ''[[chasseur]]s''.\n\nThe French Army no longer uses the term ''fusiliers'', although a number of its infantry regiments descend from fusilier regiments.\n\nThe term ''fusiliers'' is still used in the navy and air force. They are protection forces of riflemen assuring security and policing on land bases and installations as well as on ships. The commandos are selected from their ranks. The commandos are special forces units. They are:\n*[[French Navy]]: {{lang|fr|Force maritime des fusiliers marins et commandos}} ([[FORFUSCO]])\n*[[French Air Force]]: {{lang|fr|[[Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air]]}}\n\n===Germany===\n[[Image:Prussian Fusiliers.jpg|thumb|Fusiliers of the Prussian Army in the late 18th century]]\nPrussia made early use of the title \"fusilier\" for various types of infantry. In 1705, the Foot Guards (''[[Leibgarde (military)|Leibgarde]] zu Fuss'') were designated as Fusilier Guards.<ref>Richard Knotel, page 121 ''Uniforms of the World'', {{ISBN|0-684-16304-7}}</ref> By 1837, low-quality infantry raised from garrison companies also were named fusiliers. These latter units were dressed in blue with low mitre caps.<ref>http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=Prussian_Army#Prussian_Fusilier_Regiments</ref> Between 1740 and 1743 on Frederick the Great raised 14 separate Fusilier Regiments (numbers 33-40, 41-43 and 45-48).<ref>Albert Seaton, pp. 9 and 24, ''Frederick the Great's Army'', {{ISBN|0-85045-151-5}}</ref> Except for the mitre caps, these new regiments were identical in appearance, training and role to the existing line infantry (musketeers).\n\nSubsequently, [[Prussia]] and several other German states used the designation Fusilier to denote a type of [[light infantry]], dressed in green, that acted as [[skirmishers]]. In the Prussian Army, they had been formed in 1787 as independent battalions, with many of the officers having had experience in the American Revolutionary War. The Prussian reforms of 1808 absorbed the fusiliers as the third battalion of each [[line infantry]] regiment. Now wearing the same [[Prussian blue]] uniforms as standard musketeers, they were distinguished by black leather belts, and a slightly different arrangement of cartridge pouch.\n\nIn the [[Prussian Army]] of 1870, Infantry Regiments 33 to 40 plus Regiments 73 ([[Province of Hanover|Hanover]]), 80 ([[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] or Hesse-Cassel) and 86 ([[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]) were all designated as fusiliers, as was the [[Guards Fusilier Regiment|Guard Fusilier Regiment]]. In addition, the third battalions of all guard, [[grenadier]] and line infantry regiments retained the designation 'Fusilier Battalion'. They were armed with a slightly shorter version of the [[Dreyse needle gun|Dreyse]] rifle (''F\u00fcsiliergewehr''), that took a [[sword bayonet]] (''F\u00fcsilier-Seitengewehr'') rather than the standard socket [[bayonet]]. Although still theoretically skirmishers, in practice they differed little from their compatriots, as all Prussian infantry fought in a style that formed a dense 'firing' or 'skirmish' line.\n\nBy the 1880s, the title was honorific and, while implying 'specialist' or 'elite', did not have any tactical significance. In a sense, all infantry were becoming fusiliers, as weapons, tactics and equipment took on the fusilier characteristics - that is: skirmish line, shorter rifles, sword bayonets and black leather equipment. Nonetheless these titular units remained in existence until the end of the German Imperial Army in 1918, as follows:\n\n*[[Guards Fusilier Regiment|Guard Fusilier Regiment]]\n*[[33rd (East Prussian) Fusiliers \"Count Roon\"|Fusilier Regiment Count Roon]] ([[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]]n) No.33\n*Fusilier Regiment Queen Victoria of Sweden ([[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]]n) No.34\n*Fusilier Regiment Prince Henry of Prussia ([[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]) No.35\n*Fusilier Regiment General Field Marshal Count Blumenthal ([[Duchy of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]]) No.36\n*Fusilier Regiment von Steinmetz ([[West Prussia]]n) No.37\n*Fusilier Regiment Field Marshal Count Moltke ([[Province of Silesia|Silesia]]n) No.38\n*Lower [[Rhine Province|Rhineland]] Fusilier Regiment No.39\n*Fusilier Regiment Prince Charles Anton of [[Province of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] No.40\n*Fusilier Regiment Field Marshal Prince Albert of Prussia (Hanoverian) No.73\n*Fusilier Regiment von Gerdsdorff (Electoral Hessian) No.80\n*Fusilier Reqiment Queen (Schleswig-Holstein) No.86\n*Grand-Ducal [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg]] Fusilier Regiment No.90\n*[[122nd Fusilier Regiment (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Fusilier Regiment Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria King of Hungary (4th Royal)]] [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]) No.122\n\nIn addition, there was the following regiment:\n\n*Royal [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] [[Sch\u00fctzen (military)|Sch\u00fctzen]] (Fusilier) Regiment Prince George No.108\n\nThis was a special case, as it was also classed as 'Sch\u00fctzen' ([[Sharpshooter]]): this designation originally signified a type of '[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]' ([[Rifleman]]), and thus the regiment wore the J\u00e4ger-style dark green uniform.\n\nThe various Fusilier regiments and battalions in the German Imperial Army of 1914 did not have any single distinctions of dress or equipment to distinguish them as fusiliers. Individual regiments did, however, have special features worn with the dark blue full dress. Some of these features were maintained on the field grey dress of the trenches right up to 1918. As examples in full dress, the Guard Fusiliers had nickel buttons and yellow shoulder straps, and the 80th Fusiliers special braiding on collars and cuffs (deriving from their origin as the Elector of Hesse's Guards). When a regiment was permitted the distinction of a horse-hair plume on the [[pickelhaube]], for fusiliers it was always black. This included the third (Fusilier) Battalion of those regiments normally distinguished by a white horse-hair plume.\n\nIn World War II, the elite German Division ''[[Panzer-Grenadier-Division Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Gro\u00dfdeutschland]]'' contained a regiment titled ''Panzerf\u00fcsiliere'' ([[Panzer-Grenadier-Division Gro\u00dfdeutschland#Panzerf\u00fcsilier Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"|'Armoured Fusiliers']]), to maintain the old German traditions. This was again titular, as in organisation, appearance and tactical use they were essentially ''[[Panzergrenadier]]e''. The modern German Army has no fusiliers.\n\n===Mexico===\nOn 1 January 1969, the [[Mexican Army]] created the Parachute Fusilier Brigade (''Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas'') with two infantry battalions and a training battalion. The brigade's role is that of a strategic reserve, based in Mexico City.\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the [[Royal Netherlands Army]], one of the two [[foot guards]] regiments: the [[Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene]], is a regiment of fusiliers.\n\n===Portugal===\n[[Image:Fusilliers marins Portugais.jpg|thumb|Portuguese Navy Fusiliers on parade]]\nFrom the 18th to the 19th centuries, the term ''fuzileiros'' (fusiliers) was used, in the [[Portuguese Army]], to designate the regular line infantry, as opposed to the [[grenadiers]] (''granadeiros'') and the light infantry (''ca\u00e7adores'' and ''atiradores''). The Portuguese Army discontinued the use of the term in the 1860s\n\nThe term ''fuzileiros marinheiros'' (fusilier sailors) has been used in the [[Portuguese Navy]], since the late 18th century, to designate the naval infantry. The [[Portuguese Marine Corps]] is called ''Fuzileiros Navais'' (Naval Fusiliers).\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[File:Kragenspiegel F\u00fcsilier.png|thumb|right|upright|Gorget patch of Swiss F\u00fcsilier]]\nLine infantry soldiers of the lowest rank in the Swiss Army have historically been designated as fusiliers. Because the modern Swiss infantry soldier is trained in a much broader variety of tasks than his historical counterpart, and because of some negative connotations attached to the term \"F\u00fcsiliere\", modern infantry battalions of the Swiss army have been renamed \"Infanteriebataillone\" or \"Inf Bat\".<ref name=\"Admin.ch: Truppengattungen: Infanterie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.he.admin.ch/internet/heer/de/home/themen/truppengattungen/die_infanterie.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722202905/http://www.he.admin.ch/internet/heer/de/home/themen/truppengattungen/die_infanterie.html |archivedate=2012-07-22 }},.</ref> The individual soldiers are officially called \"Infanteristen\", not \"F\u00fcsiliere\" but colloquially they are still referred to as \"F\u00fcsiliere\" or \"F\u00fcsle\". This meaning is retained in the name of the 1938 Swiss film ''[[Fusilier Wipf]]''.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe original fusiliers in the British Army were The 7th Foot, Royal Regiment of Fuzileers raised in 1685. This subsequently became [[The Royal Fusiliers]] (City of London Regiment). The original purpose of this unit was to act as escort to artillery guns, as well as keeping discipline amongst the civilian drivers.<ref name=\"barnes\"/> Both Scots (21st Foot) and Welsh (23rd Foot) regiments also became fusiliers in the period up to and including 1702 and all three regiments were distinguished by the wearing of a slightly shorter version of the Mitred Cap worn by Grenadier companies of all other infantry regiments. A number of additional infantry regiments were subsequently designated as fusiliers during the 19th century, but this was simply a historic distinction without any relationship to special weapons or roles.\n\nIn 1865, a distinctive head-dress was authorised for [[British Army]] fusilier regiments.<ref name=\"kipling&king\">{{cite book |title=Head-Dress Badges of the British Army.

This is a short cut feather plume, the colour or colours of which varied according to the regiment. Initially, the only regiment authorised to wear a plume or hackle were the 5th of Foot (Northumberland Fusiliers). The regiment had originally worn a white feather distinction, authorised in 1824 to commemorate the victory of St Lucia in 1778 when men of the Fifth Regiment were supposed to have taken white feathers from the hats of fallen French soldiers. When, in 1829, a white plume was ordered for all line infantry regiments, to preserve the Fifth (Northumberland) Regiment's emblem, they were authorised to wear a white plume with a red tip, allegedly to indicate a distinction won in battle. The Fifth were designated Fusiliers in 1836.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Boer War]], plumes were added to the headgear of all fusilier regiments in recognition of their service in South Africa.\n\nThe following fusilier regiments existed prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The new regiment wore the white hackle of the RSF, with a flaming grenade badge bearing the monogram of the HLI.<ref name=\"rhf_history\"/>\n*Under the same review, the three English fusilier regiments were grouped as the [[Fusilier Brigade]] in 1958. While retaining their individual identities, a single cap badge was adopted. This was flaming grenade bearing St George and the Dragon within a laurel wreath the whole ensigned by a crown. This combined elements of the badges of the three regiments, who continued to be distinguished by their coloured hackles: red over white for the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, white for the Royal Fusiliers and primrose yellow for the Lancashire Fusiliers.\n*Also in 1958 the [[North Irish Brigade]] was formed, consisting of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Fusiliers and the [[Royal Ulster Rifles]]. All regiments adopted a harp and crown badge on the [[caubeen]], worn with a hackle: grey for the Inniskillings, green for the Royal Irish Fusiliers and black for the Rifles.\n*On 1 May 1963, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was redesignated as the [[Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers]] and joined the Fusilier Brigade.

While fusilier is derived from the 17th-century [[French language|French]] word ''fusil'' \u2013 meaning a type of [[flintlock]] [[musket]] \u2013 the term has been used in contrasting ways in different countries and at different times, including soldiers guarding [[artillery]], various [[special forces|elite units]], ordinary [[line infantry]] and other uses.\n\n== Derivation of the word ==\nThe word ''fusil'', which was the name of the type of musket carried by a fusilier, is itself derived from the Old French and Latin ''foisil'' , meaning a piece of flint.<ref>[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Godefroy|Godefroy, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric]], ''Dictionnaire de l'ancienne langue fran\u00e7aise et de tous ses dialectes du IX<sup>e</sup> au XV<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle (1881)''([http://micmap.org/dicfro/search/dictionnaire-godefroy/foisil foisil])</ref> In the Waray language (a dialect spoken by the Waray people of Eastern Leyte, Biliran island and Western Samar located in the Visayan islands of the Philippines), the word for gun or using a gun is also called \"pusil\", this may be a corruption of the French term.<ref> ([https://glosbe.com/war/tl/pusil])</ref> What is more likely is that their use of \"pusil\" is derived from the old Spanish word for gun, \"fusil\". Spain was the colonial power occupying the Philippines for centuries and Waray speakers have difficulty pronouncing the letter \"f\" so it is usually given the sound of a \"p\" thus fusil perhaps became pusil.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Fus. Urwin and Eastwood 2, AHD, 5-19-07.jpg|thumb|[[historical reenactment|Reenactor]]s in the uniform of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] (23rd Regiment of Foot), one of the first British fusilier units]]\n[[Flintlock]] small arms were first used militarily during the early 17th century. Flintlocks, at the time, were more reliable and safer to use than [[matchlock]] muskets, which required a [[match]] to be lit near the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] before the weapon could be triggered. By contrast, flintlocks were fired using a piece of [[flint]]. By the time of the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131652), one flintlock musket, the [[snaphance]], was in common use in Britain.\n\nThe term ''fusiliers'' was first used officially by the [[French Army]] in 1670, when four fusiliers were distributed among each [[company (military unit)|company]] of infantry.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Cathal J. Nolan, 2008, ''Wars of the Age of Louis XIV'', 1650\u20131715'', Westport, Conn.; Greenwood Press, p168.</ref> The following year the ''Fusiliers du Roi'' (\"King's Fusiliers\"), the first [[regiment]] composed primarily of soldiers with flintlocks, was formed<ref name=\"Nolan\"/> by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].\n\nGuarding and escorting [[artillery]] pieces was the first task assigned to the ''Fusiliers du Roi'': flintlocks were especially useful around [[field artillery]], as they were less likely than matchlocks to accidentally ignite open barrels of [[gunpowder]], required at the time to load [[cannon]]s.<ref name=\"Nolan\"/> At the time, artillery units also required guards to maintain discipline amongst civilian [[drayman|draymen]].<ref name=\"barnes\">{{cite book |title=A History of the Regiments and Uniforms of the British Army |last=Barnes |first=R M |year=1972 |publisher=Sphere Books |location= |isbn= |page=28}}</ref> Hence the term fusilier became strongly associated with the role of guarding artillery in Britain and the English-speaking world,<ref name=\"barnes\"/> especially after the formation of the first official \"Fusilier\" units, during the 1680s. As late as the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756-63, the Austrian Army maintained an Artillery Fusilier Regiment for the exclusive roles of providing support for field batteries on the battlefield and of protecting the artillery when on the march and in camp.<ref>{{cite book|first=J.|last=Braithwaite|page=24|title=Uniforms of the Seven Years' War Austria|ISBN=0-904555-01-1}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 18th century, as flintlocks became the main weapon used by infantry, the term fusilier gradually ceased to have this meaning and was applied to various units.<ref name=\"Nolan\"/>\n\n==Fusiliers by country==\n===Belgium===\nThe [[Belgian Army]] has no specific regiment called fusiliers, but the general denomination for infantry soldiers is ''Storm fusilier'' ({{lang-nl|stormfuselier}}; {{lang-fr|fusilier d'assaut}}).\n\nThe [[Belgian Navy]] used to have a regiment of marine infantry composed of ''marine fusiliers'' in charge of the protection of the naval bases. However this unit was disbanded in the 1990s reforms.\n\n===Brazil===\nAdopting a number of practices from the Portuguese military in the 19th century, the [[Brazilian Army]] uses the term ''fuzileiros'' (fusiliers) to designate the regular line infantry, as opposed to the [[grenadiers]] (''granadeiros'') and the light infantry (''ca\u00e7adores'' and ''atiradores''). In addition, the [[Brazilian Marine Corps]] is called ''Fuzileiros Navais'' (Naval Fusiliers).\n\n===Canada===\nThere are five fusilier regiments patterned on the British tradition forming part of the [[Canadian Militia]], and later the [[Canadian Army]]. The [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]], although not fusiliers, wears fusilier ceremonial uniform with scarlet plumes because of its alliance with the Royal Welch Fusiliers.\n\nThe five Canadian fusilier regiments are:\n*[[The Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada]] (which wears Highland uniform, but with white fusilier hackles on [[balmoral bonnet]]s)\n*[[Les Fusiliers du St-Laurent|Les Fusiliers du S<sup>t</sup>-Laurent]], white plume\n*[[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]], white plume\n*[[The Princess Louise Fusiliers]] (which wear a grey hackle as a token of their alliance with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, now part of the Royal Irish Regiment)\n*[[Les Fusiliers de Sherbrooke]], white plume\n\nThe [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]] were known as 1st Regiment \"Prince of Wales' Fusiliers\" before 1911.\n\n===France===\n[[Image:1er RFM flag guard Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The flag of the 1st Regiment of [[Fusiliers Marins|Naval Fusiliers]] at the 2008 [[Bastille Day Military Parade]]]]\nBy the mid-18th century, the [[French Army]] used the term ''fusiliers'' to designate ordinary [[line infantry]], as opposed to specialist or \u00e9lite infantry, such as ''[[grenadier]]s'', ''[[voltigeur]]s'', ''[[carabinier]]s'' or ''[[chasseur]]s''.\n\nThe French Army no longer uses the term ''fusiliers'', although a number of its infantry regiments descend from fusilier regiments.\n\nThe term ''fusiliers'' is still used in the navy and air force. They are protection forces of riflemen assuring security and policing on land bases and installations as well as on ships. The commandos are selected from their ranks. The commandos are special forces units. They are:\n*[[French Navy]]: {{lang|fr|Force maritime des fusiliers marins et commandos}} ([[FORFUSCO]])\n*[[French Air Force]]: {{lang|fr|[[Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air]]}}\n\n===Germany===\n[[Image:Prussian Fusiliers.jpg|thumb|Fusiliers of the Prussian Army in the late 18th century]]\nPrussia made early use of the title \"fusilier\" for various types of infantry. In 1705, the Foot Guards (''[[Leibgarde (military)|Leibgarde]] zu Fuss'') were designated as Fusilier Guards.<ref>Richard Knotel, page 121 ''Uniforms of the World'', {{ISBN|0-684-16304-7}}</ref> By 1837, low-quality infantry raised from garrison companies also were named fusiliers. These latter units were dressed in blue with low mitre caps.<ref>http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=Prussian_Army#Prussian_Fusilier_Regiments</ref> Between 1740 and 1743 on Frederick the Great raised 14 separate Fusilier Regiments (numbers 33-40, 41-43 and 45-48).<ref>Albert Seaton, pp. 9 and 24, ''Frederick the Great's Army'', {{ISBN|0-85045-151-5}}</ref> Except for the mitre caps, these new regiments were identical in appearance, training and role to the existing line infantry (musketeers).\n\nSubsequently, [[Prussia]] and several other German states used the designation Fusilier to denote a type of [[light infantry]], dressed in green, that acted as [[skirmishers]]. In the Prussian Army, they had been formed in 1787 as independent battalions, with many of the officers having had experience in the American Revolutionary War. The Prussian reforms of 1808 absorbed the fusiliers as the third battalion of each [[line infantry]] regiment. Now wearing the same [[Prussian blue]] uniforms as standard musketeers, they were distinguished by black leather belts, and a slightly different arrangement of cartridge pouch.\n\nIn the [[Prussian Army]] of 1870, Infantry Regiments 33 to 40 plus Regiments 73 ([[Province of Hanover|Hanover]]), 80 ([[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] or Hesse-Cassel) and 86 ([[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]) were all designated as fusiliers, as was the [[Guards Fusilier Regiment|Guard Fusilier Regiment]]. In addition, the third battalions of all guard, [[grenadier]] and line infantry regiments retained the designation 'Fusilier Battalion'. They were armed with a slightly shorter version of the [[Dreyse needle gun|Dreyse]] rifle (''F\u00fcsiliergewehr''), that took a [[sword bayonet]] (''F\u00fcsilier-Seitengewehr'') rather than the standard socket [[bayonet]]. Although still theoretically skirmishers, in practice they differed little from their compatriots, as all Prussian infantry fought in a style that formed a dense 'firing' or 'skirmish' line.\n\nBy the 1880s, the title was honorific and, while implying 'specialist' or 'elite', did not have any tactical significance. In a sense, all infantry were becoming fusiliers, as weapons, tactics and equipment took on the fusilier characteristics - that is: skirmish line, shorter rifles, sword bayonets and black leather equipment. Nonetheless these titular units remained in existence until the end of the German Imperial Army in 1918, as follows:\n\n*[[Guards Fusilier Regiment|Guard Fusilier Regiment]]\n*[[33rd (East Prussian) Fusiliers \"Count Roon\"|Fusilier Regiment Count Roon]] ([[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]]n) No.33\n*Fusilier Regiment Queen Victoria of Sweden ([[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]]n) No.34\n*Fusilier Regiment Prince Henry of Prussia ([[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]) No.35\n*Fusilier Regiment General Field Marshal Count Blumenthal ([[Duchy of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]]) No.36\n*Fusilier Regiment von Steinmetz ([[West Prussia]]n) No.37\n*Fusilier Regiment Field Marshal Count Moltke ([[Province of Silesia|Silesia]]n) No.38\n*Lower [[Rhine Province|Rhineland]] Fusilier Regiment No.39\n*Fusilier Regiment Prince Charles Anton of [[Province of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] No.40\n*Fusilier Regiment Field Marshal Prince Albert of Prussia (Hanoverian) No.73\n*Fusilier Regiment von Gerdsdorff (Electoral Hessian) No.80\n*Fusilier Reqiment Queen (Schleswig-Holstein) No.86\n*Grand-Ducal [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg]] Fusilier Regiment No.90\n*[[122nd Fusilier Regiment (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Fusilier Regiment Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria King of Hungary (4th Royal)]] [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]) No.122\n\nIn addition, there was the following regiment:\n\n*Royal [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] [[Sch\u00fctzen (military)|Sch\u00fctzen]] (Fusilier) Regiment Prince George No.108\n\nThis was a special case, as it was also classed as 'Sch\u00fctzen' ([[Sharpshooter]]): this designation originally signified a type of '[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]' ([[Rifleman]]), and thus the regiment wore the J\u00e4ger-style dark green uniform.\n\nThe various Fusilier regiments and battalions in the German Imperial Army of 1914 did not have any single distinctions of dress or equipment to distinguish them as fusiliers. Individual regiments did, however, have special features worn with the dark blue full dress. Some of these features were maintained on the field grey dress of the trenches right up to 1918. As examples in full dress, the Guard Fusiliers had nickel buttons and yellow shoulder straps, and the 80th Fusiliers special braiding on collars and cuffs (deriving from their origin as the Elector of Hesse's Guards). When a regiment was permitted the distinction of a horse-hair plume on the [[pickelhaube]], for fusiliers it was always black. This included the third (Fusilier) Battalion of those regiments normally distinguished by a white horse-hair plume.\n\nIn World War II, the elite German Division ''[[Panzer-Grenadier-Division Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Gro\u00dfdeutschland]]'' contained a regiment titled ''Panzerf\u00fcsiliere'' ([[Panzer-Grenadier-Division Gro\u00dfdeutschland#Panzerf\u00fcsilier Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"|'Armoured Fusiliers']]), to maintain the old German traditions. This was again titular, as in organisation, appearance and tactical use they were essentially ''[[Panzergrenadier]]e''. The modern German Army has no fusiliers.\n\n===Mexico===\nOn 1 January 1969, the [[Mexican Army]] created the Parachute Fusilier Brigade (''Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas'') with two infantry battalions and a training battalion. The brigade's role is that of a strategic reserve, based in Mexico City.\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the [[Royal Netherlands Army]], one of the two [[foot guards]] regiments, the [[Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene]] is a regiment of fusiliers.\n\n===Portugal===\n[[Image:Fusilliers marins Portugais.jpg|thumb|Portuguese Navy Fusiliers on parade]]\nFrom the 18th to the 19th centuries, the term ''fuzileiros'' (fusiliers) was used, in the [[Portuguese Army]], to designate the regular line infantry, as opposed to the [[grenadiers]] (''granadeiros'') and the light infantry (''ca\u00e7adores'' and ''atiradores''). The Portuguese Army discontinued the use of the term in the 1860s\n\nThe term ''fuzileiros marinheiros'' (fusilier sailors) has been used in the [[Portuguese Navy]], since the late 18th century, to designate the naval infantry. The [[Portuguese Marine Corps]] is called ''Fuzileiros Navais'' (Naval Fusiliers).\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[File:Kragenspiegel F\u00fcsilier.png|thumb|right|upright|Gorget patch of Swiss F\u00fcsilier]]\nLine infantry soldiers of the lowest rank in the Swiss Army have historically been designated as fusiliers. Because the modern Swiss infantry soldier is trained in a much broader variety of tasks than his historical counterpart, and because of some negative connotations attached to the term \"F\u00fcsiliere\", modern infantry battalions of the Swiss army have been renamed \"Infanteriebataillone\" or \"Inf Bat\".<ref name=\"Admin.ch: Truppengattungen: Infanterie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.he.admin.ch/internet/heer/de/home/themen/truppengattungen/die_infanterie.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722202905/http://www.he.admin.ch/internet/heer/de/home/themen/truppengattungen/die_infanterie.html |archivedate=2012-07-22 }},.</ref> The individual soldiers are officially called \"Infanteristen\", not \"F\u00fcsiliere\" but colloquially they are still referred to as \"F\u00fcsiliere\" or \"F\u00fcsle\". This meaning is retained in the name of the 1938 Swiss film ''[[Fusilier Wipf]]''.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe original fusiliers in the British Army were The 7th Foot, Royal Regiment of Fuzileers raised in 1685. This subsequently became [[The Royal Fusiliers]] (City of London Regiment). The original purpose of this unit was to act as escort to artillery guns, as well as keeping discipline amongst the civilian drivers.<ref name=\"barnes\"/> Both Scots (21st Foot) and Welsh (23rd Foot) regiments also became fusiliers in the period up to and including 1702 and all three regiments were distinguished by the wearing of a slightly shorter version of the Mitred Cap worn by Grenadier companies of all other infantry regiments. A number of additional infantry regiments were subsequently designated as fusiliers during the 19th century, but this was simply a historic distinction without any relationship to special weapons or roles.\n\nIn 1865, a distinctive head-dress was authorised for [[British Army]] fusilier regiments.<ref name=\"kipling&king\">{{cite book |title=Head-Dress Badges of the British Army.

This is a short cut feather plume, the colour or colours of which varied according to the regiment. Initially, the only regiment authorised to wear a plume or hackle were the 5th of Foot (Northumberland Fusiliers). The regiment had originally worn a white feather distinction, authorised in 1824 to commemorate the victory of St Lucia in 1778 when men of the Fifth Regiment were supposed to have taken white feathers from the hats of fallen French soldiers. When, in 1829, a white plume was ordered for all line infantry regiments, to preserve the Fifth (Northumberland) Regiment's emblem, they were authorised to wear a white plume with a red tip, allegedly to indicate a distinction won in battle. The Fifth were designated Fusiliers in 1836.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Boer War]], plumes were added to the headgear of all fusilier regiments in recognition of their service in South Africa.\n\nThe following fusilier regiments existed prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Royal Scots Fusiliers was amalgamated with the [[Highland Light Infantry]] on 20 January 1959 to form the [[Royal Highland Fusiliers]]. The new regiment wore the white hackle of the RSF, with a flaming grenade badge bearing the monogram of the HLI.<ref name=\"rhf_history\"/>\n*Under the same review, the three English fusilier regiments were grouped as the [[Fusilier Brigade]] in 1958. While retaining their individual identities, a single cap badge was adopted. This was flaming grenade bearing St George and the Dragon within a laurel wreath the whole ensigned by a crown. This combined elements of the badges of the three regiments, who continued to be distinguished by their coloured hackles: red over white for the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, white for the Royal Fusiliers and primrose yellow for the Lancashire Fusiliers.\n*Also in 1958 the [[North Irish Brigade]] was formed, consisting of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Fusiliers and the [[Royal Ulster Rifles]]. All regiments adopted a harp and crown badge on the [[caubeen]], worn with a hackle: grey for the Inniskillings, green for the Royal Irish Fusiliers and black for the Rifles.\n*On 1 May 1963, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was redesignated as the [[Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers]] and joined the Fusilier Brigade. An old gold and blue hackle was adopted.\n*On 23 April 1968, ([[St George's Day]]) the four regiments of the Fusilier Brigade were amalgamated to form [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]].
