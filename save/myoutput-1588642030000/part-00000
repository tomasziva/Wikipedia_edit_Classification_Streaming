Qureshi apologised to any who were offended by her words, and stated that \"the debate was about the plight of the Palestinian people, and in no way did I mean to equate events in Gaza with the Holocaust\", adding that \"I know the Holocaust was the most brutal act of genocide of the 20th century, and no one should seek to underestimate its impact\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/07/labour-mp-apologises-holocaust-remark|title=Labour MP apologises for Holocaust remark|work=The Guardian|agency=Press Association|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317171354/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/07/labour-mp-apologises-holocaust-remark|archive-date=17 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Dysch|first=Marcus|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/115505/labour-mp-yasmin-qureshi-apologises-gaza-holocaust-comparison|title=Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi apologises for Gaza-Holocaust comparison|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=10 February 2014|accessdate=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011065610/http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/115505/labour-mp-yasmin-qureshi-apologises-gaza-holocaust-comparison|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/07/labour-mp-apologises-holocaust-remark|title=Labour MP apologises for Holocaust remark|first=Press|last=Association|date=7 February 2014|via=www.theguardian.com|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317171354/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/07/labour-mp-apologises-holocaust-remark|archive-date=17 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, ''[[The Times]]'' stated that Qureshi accepted a \u00a35,000 donation from [[Sufyan Ismail]] but failed to declare it;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/extremist-leads-muslim-lobby-group-7q2hg30zc|title=Extremist leads Muslim lobby group|first=Dominic Kennedy|last=Investigations\u00a0Editor|date=10 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk|access-date=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407072843/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/extremist-leads-muslim-lobby-group-7q2hg30zc|archive-date=7 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> it was found that the donation was in fact declared on time and in keeping with parliamentary procedure, it was declared through Ismail's company name 'One Group' and can be found on public parliamentary donation records.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/150713/150713.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121030125/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/150713/150713.pdf |archive-date=21 November 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://yasminqureshi.org.uk/ Yasmin Qureshi MP] Official constituency website\n*{{UK MP links | parliament = yasmin-qureshi/3924 | guardian = 8667/yasmin-qureshi | publicwhip = Yasmin_Qureshi | theywork = yasmin_qureshi | record = Yasmin-Qureshi/Bolton-South-East/1150 | bbc = 35869.stm | journalisted = }}\n* {{C-SPAN|yasminqureshi}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Brian Iddon]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title={{nowrap|[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Bolton South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bolton South East]]}}|years=[[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]]\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{North West Labour Party MPs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qureshi, Yasmin}}\n[[Category:1963 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alumni of London South Bank University]]\n[[Category:British politicians of Pakistani descent]]\n[[Category:British Muslims]]\n[[Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Pakistani emigrants to the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:British people of Punjabi descent]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 2010\u20132015]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 2015\u20132017]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 2017\u20132019]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 2019\u2013]]\n[[Category:21st-century British women politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Bolton South East]]\n", "name_user": "Trappist the monk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eControversies:remove 'invisible' characters from cs1|2 template parameters; (1\u00d7 NBSP; empty parameters removed)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasmin_Qureshi"}
