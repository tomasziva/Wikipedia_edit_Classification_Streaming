Dagdeviren is the first Turkish scientist in the history of the Harvard Society to become a [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows]] at Harvard University. As a faculty member, she directs her own Conformable Decoders research group at the [[MIT Media Lab]].<ref name=\"cd\"/> The group works at the intersection of materials science, engineering and biomedical engineering. They create mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems that can intimately integrate with the target object of interest for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting, among other applications.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/mission.html|title=Conformable Decoders|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> Dagdeviren believes that vital information from nature and the human body is \u201ccoded\u201d in various forms of physical patterns. Her research focuses on the creation of conformable decoders that can \u201cdecode\u201d these patterns into beneficial signals and/or energy.<ref name=\"cd\" /> \n\n==Early life==\nCanan Da\u011fdeviren was born in [[Istanbul]], Turkey on May 4, 1985. She is the oldest of three, and has two younger brothers. She completed her primary education in [[\u0130zmit]], where she also attended middle school. However, her family was forced to leave the city after the [[1999 \u0130zmit earthquake]], and she continued her high school education in [[Adana]].\n\nDagdeviren was drawn to scientific exploration from a very young age. In an interview with Discover Magazine, she recalls being fascinated by smashing rocks together and producing sparks, saying \u201cI loved the idea that you deform this material and create sparks -- it was very exciting.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/how-flexible-sensors-might-begin-to-read-the-bodys-language|title=How Flexible Sensors Might Begin to Read the Body's Language|website=Discover Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Another source of inspiration came from a book that her father gave her on the life of Marie Curie. She quickly became infatuated not just with Curie's work, but also with the research conducted by her husband Pierre Curie, who Dagdeviren considers her \u201cscientific love.\u201d Pierre and his brother Jacques first described [[piezoelectricity]] in 1880,<ref name=\":2\" /> a concept that would later serve as the driving force behind many of Dagdeviren's own projects and applications.\n\nFinally, at the heart of her work is Dagdeviren's own family. An early source of inspiration was learning about her grandfather, who died of heart failure at age 28. Even as a young girl, she promised herself that someday she would create technology that would decode and monitor similar health issues to honor his memory.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Education & Academic Career==\nCanan Dagdeviren studied [[Physics Engineering]] at the [[Hacettepe University]] in [[Ankara]], graduating in 2007. She obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree from [[Sabanc\u0131 University]] in Istanbul, and won a [[Fulbright scholarship]] for study in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tr.usembassy.gov/canan_dagdeviren_story_2015/|title=Canan Dagdeviren - An Inspiring Story|date=2015-01-17|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Turkey|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> With this scholarship, she chose to conduct research in [[materials science]] and engineering at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]], where she focused on exploring patterning techniques and creating piezoelectric biomedical systems. Here, one of the projects that she developed was a conformable, piezoelectric, energy harvester that converts mechanical energy from internal organ movements into electric energy to power medical devices. It is soft and flexible and conforms to the heart as well as other soft tissues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/prize/scilifelab/canan-dagdeviren|title=Canan Dagdeviren|date=2016-12-01|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> This technology could extend the battery life of implanted electronics or eliminate the need for battery replacement, sparing patients from repeated operations and the risk of surgical complications. In August 2014 she received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.milliyet.com.tr/gundem/canan-dagdeviren-kimdir-2392696|title=Canan Da\u011fdeviren kimdir?|website=Milliyet|language=tr|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Her advisor was [[John A.

She teaches a course on conformable devices every semester,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/courses.html|title=Conformable Decoders|website=conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> and also serves as a freshman advisor.\n\nRecently, she was invited to present to the World.Minds community at the annual invitation-only symposium in Zurich, Switzerland. Her most recent research and achievements are summarized in her [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWoqAgsQBsg&t=2s World.Minds talk].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWoqAgsQBsg&t=2s|title=Canan Da\u011fdeviren: Conformable Decoders (2019 WORLD.MINDS Annual Symposium)|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Projects & Publications ==\n\n=== YellowBox ===\n[[File:20171129 YellowBox Article copy 2.png|thumb|Yellowbox|158x158px|alt=]]The YellowBox is a cleanroom used by Conformable Decoders at the [[MIT Media Lab]], which Dagdeviren designed and constructed from the ground up in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/meet-yellowbox/|title=Meet the YellowBox|last=Dagdeviren|first=Canan|website=MIT Media Lab|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> When she was a PhD student, she promised herself that if she ever had the opportunity to build her own space, it would be physically transparent so that anyone passing by would have the ability to observe, take notes, and learn from her without needing any special permissions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/launching-a-lab-7b02413072ad|title=Launching a lab|last=Lab|first=MIT Media|date=2017-04-27|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> This inclusivity is part of what makes YellowBox such a unique scientific environment. \nAnother unique aspect of YellowBox is that it is organized using [[5S (methodology)|5S Methodology]]. 5S is a system which uses five guiding practices to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness: Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/managing-a-lab-18/|title=Managing a Lab|last=Dagdeviren|first=Canan|website=MIT Media Lab|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Essentially, 5S is an organizational methodology that uses visual labels\u2014color-coded based on functionality\u2014to organize spaces and increase safety, identifying potential hazards and procedural information.<ref name=\":0\" /> As a result of this highly organized and efficient system, YellowBox achieved a Green Labs certification by Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) in 2017\u2014the ''first'' research lab at the MIT Media Lab to receive this designation since its founding in 1985.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:PZTMEH-2 08.27.2016 copy.tif|thumb|PZT MEH|148x148px]]\n\n=== Conformal Piezoelectric Mechanical Energy Harvesters: Mechanically Invisible Human Dynamos (PZT MEH) ===\nIn 2014, Dagdeviren and her team developed conformal piezoelectric mechanical energy harvesters, which have been described as \u201cmechanically invisible human dynamos.\u201d<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/project1.html|title=Conformable Decoders|website=conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> This project seeks to develop conformal piezoelectric patches integrated into personal garments to extract energy from body movements such as the motion of arms, fingers, and legs. In the future, this work could improve quality life for people and potentially provide environmentally friendly power. Since these energy harvesters are powered by human motion instead of battery power, the need for replacements and high risk/high cost surgical procedures to change depleted batteries could be eliminated.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Miniaturized Neural System For Chronic, Local Intracerebral Drug Delivery (MiNDS) ===\n[[File:MiNDS Device1 01.12.2018 copy.jpg|thumb|MiNDS|162x162px]]\nIn 2018,  Dagdeviren and her team developed an implantable, remotely controllable, miniaturized neural drug delivery system permitting dynamic adjustment of therapy with pinpoint spatial accuracy. Recent advances in medications for neurodegenerative disorders are expanding opportunities for improving the debilitating symptoms suffered by patients. Existing pharmacologic treatments, however, often rely on systemic drug administration, which result in broad drug distribution and consequent increased risk for toxicity. Given that many key neural circuitries have sub\u2013cubic millimeter volumes and cell-specific characteristics, small-volume drug administration into affected brain areas with minimal diffusion and leakage is essential. Dagdeviren and her team demonstrates that this device can chemically modulate local neuronal activity in small-animal (rodent) and large-animal (nonhuman primate) models, while simultaneously allowing the recording of neural activity to enable feedback control<ref>{{Cite web|title=Miniaturized neural system for chronic, local intracerebral drug delivery|url=https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/425/eaan2742?rss=1|last=|first=|date=Jan. 24, 2018|website=Science Translational Medicine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n=== Flexible Piezoelectric Devices for Gastrointestinal Motility Sensing (PZT GI-S) ===\n[[File:PZT GIS 09.27.2017 copy 2.png|thumb|PZT GI-S|161x161px]]\nIn 2017, the PZT GI-S project (essentially \u201ca Fitbit for the stomach.\"<ref name=\"statnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/29/mit-capsule-body-listening-devices/|title=Our bodies talk to us \u2014 and these implantable devices can help listen|date=2018-06-29|website=STAT|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>) was published. Dagdeviren and fellow collaborators designed an ingestible, flexible piezoelectric device that senses mechanical deformation within the gastric cavity. They demonstrated the capabilities of the sensor in both in vitro and ex vivo simulated gastric models, quantified its key behaviors in the gastrointestinal tract using computational modelling, and validated its functionality in awake and ambulating swine. The proof-of-concept device may lead to the development of ingestible piezoelectric devices that might safely sense mechanical variations and harvest mechanical energy inside the gastrointestinal tract for the diagnosis and treatment of motility disorders, as well as for monitoring ingestion in bariatric applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/project3.html|title=Conformable Decoders|website=conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic Textile Conformable Suit (E-TeCS) ===\n[[File:E-TeCS.jpg|thumb|120x120px|E-TeCS]]\nIn 2020, Dagdeviren and her team created a tailored, electronic textile conformable suit [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41528-020-0068-y (E-TeCS)] to perform large-scale, multi-modal physiological (temperature, heart rate, and respiration) sensing ''in vivo'' <ref>{{cite web|title=Sensors woven into a shirt can monitor vital signs|url=http://news.mit.edu/2020/sensors-monitor-vital-signs-0423|last=Trafton|first=Anne|date=2020-04-23|website=MIT News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>. The rapid advancement of electronic devices and fabrication technologies has further promoted the field of wearables and smart textiles. However, most of the current efforts in textile electronics focus on a single modality and cover a small area. E-TeCS introduces a new platform of modular, conformable (i.e., flexible and stretchable) distributed sensor networks that can be embedded into digitally-knit textiles. This platform can be customized for various forms, sizes and functions using standard, accessible and high-throughput textile manufacturing and garment patterning techniques.\n\n=== The Bees of Science ===\n[[File:0*yC2HEE0sPu1wZFDx.jpg|thumb|The Bees of Science|alt=|180x180px]]\nIn June 2019, Dagdeviren blended media, art, and science to create an exhibition which was featured in the lobby of the Media Lab for 8 months. The exhibition displayed her students\u2019 work, and was titled The Bees of Science. In a blog post, she explained \u201cLike bees, my students work at the intersection of nature, art, and science, drawing on both their experiences in diverse fields of science and engineering and also their diverse cultural backgrounds, much as the bees draw nectar from a host of different flowers. They then apply their minds, hearts, and hands to create unique micro- and nano-scale, mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems for human health monitoring\u2014their scientific \u201choney.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/canan-dagdeviren-reflects-on-exhibiting-student-work/|title=Exhibiting at the Media Lab: Canan Dagdeviren reflects on exhibiting student work|last=Dagdeviren|first=Canan|website=MIT Media Lab|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Awards & Honors==\nIn 2014, Dagdeviren became the first Turkish scientist to be elected as a Junior Fellow of Harvard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/life/2016/04/19/harvards-first-turkish-junior-follow-invited-to-join-mit-faculty|title=Harvard's first Turkish junior follow invited to join MIT faculty|website=DailySabah|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, MIT Technology Review named her among the \"Top 35 Innovators Under 35\" (inventor category),<ref>{{Citation|title=Canan Dagdeviren - The Innovators Under 35 EmTech 2015 MIT Technology Review|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi82tShB18s|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> and Forbes magazine selected her as one of the \"Top 30 Under 30 in Science.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ggik45ekh/canan-dagdeviren-29/|title=Canan Dagdeviren, 29|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> The following year she received many honors, including being named a Gifted Citizen by Ciudad de las Ideas of Puebla, Mexico,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/285416|title=Gifted Citizen: los emprendedores sociales que cambian las reglas del juego|last=Lagos|first=Anna|date=2016-11-18|website=Entrepreneur|language=es|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> and the Spotlight Health Scholar by Aspen Institute.

Dagdeviren is the first Turkish scientist in the history of the Harvard Society to become a [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows]] at Harvard University. As a faculty member, she directs her own Conformable Decoders research group at the [[MIT Media Lab]].<ref name=\"cd\"/> The group works at the intersection of materials science, engineering and biomedical engineering. They create mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems that can intimately integrate with the target object of interest for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting, among other applications.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/mission.html|title=Conformable Decoders|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> Dagdeviren believes that vital information from nature and the human body is \u201ccoded\u201d in various forms of physical patterns. Her research focuses on the creation of conformable decoders that can \u201cdecode\u201d these patterns into beneficial signals and/or energy.<ref name=\"cd\" /> \n\n==Early life==\nCanan Da\u011fdeviren was born in [[Istanbul]], Turkey on May 4, 1985. She is the oldest of three, and has two younger brothers. She completed her primary education in [[\u0130zmit]], where she also attended middle school. However, her family was forced to leave the city after the [[1999 \u0130zmit earthquake]], and she continued her high school education in [[Adana]].\n\nDagdeviren was drawn to scientific exploration from a very young age. In an interview with Discover Magazine, she recalls being fascinated by smashing rocks together and producing sparks, saying \u201cI loved the idea that you deform this material and create sparks -- it was very exciting.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/how-flexible-sensors-might-begin-to-read-the-bodys-language|title=How Flexible Sensors Might Begin to Read the Body's Language|website=Discover Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Another source of inspiration came from a book that her father gave her on the life of Marie Curie. She quickly became infatuated not just with Curie's work, but also with the research conducted by her husband Pierre Curie, who Dagdeviren considers her \u201cscientific love.\u201d Pierre and his brother Jacques first described [[piezoelectricity]] in 1880,<ref name=\":2\" /> a concept that would later serve as the driving force behind many of Dagdeviren's own projects and applications.\n\nFinally, at the heart of her work is Dagdeviren's own family. An early source of inspiration was learning about her grandfather, who died of heart failure at age 28. Even as a young girl, she promised herself that someday she would create technology that would decode and monitor similar health issues to honor his memory.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Education & Academic Career==\nCanan Dagdeviren studied [[Physics Engineering]] at the [[Hacettepe University]] in [[Ankara]], graduating in 2007. She obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree from [[Sabanc\u0131 University]] in Istanbul, and won a [[Fulbright scholarship]] for study in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tr.usembassy.gov/canan_dagdeviren_story_2015/|title=Canan Dagdeviren - An Inspiring Story|date=2015-01-17|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Turkey|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> With this scholarship, she chose to conduct research in [[materials science]] and engineering at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]], where she focused on exploring patterning techniques and creating piezoelectric biomedical systems. Here, one of the projects that she developed was a conformable, piezoelectric, energy harvester that converts mechanical energy from internal organ movements into electric energy to power medical devices.

Recent advances in medications for neurodegenerative disorders are expanding opportunities for improving the debilitating symptoms suffered by patients. Existing pharmacologic treatments, however, often rely on systemic drug administration, which result in broad drug distribution and consequent increased risk for toxicity. Given that many key neural circuitries have sub\u2013cubic millimeter volumes and cell-specific characteristics, small-volume drug administration into affected brain areas with minimal diffusion and leakage is essential. Dagdeviren and her team demonstrates that this device can chemically modulate local neuronal activity in small-animal (rodent) and large-animal (nonhuman primate) models, while simultaneously allowing the recording of neural activity to enable feedback control<ref>{{Cite web|title=Miniaturized neural system for chronic, local intracerebral drug delivery|url=https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/425/eaan2742?rss=1|last=|first=|date=Jan. 24, 2018|website=Science Translational Medicine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n=== Flexible Piezoelectric Devices for Gastrointestinal Motility Sensing (PZT GI-S) ===\n[[File:PZT GIS 09.27.2017 copy 2.png|thumb|PZT GI-S|161x161px]]\nIn 2017, the PZT GI-S project is essentially \u201ca Fitbit for the stomach.\"<ref name=\"statnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/29/mit-capsule-body-listening-devices/|title=Our bodies talk to us \u2014 and these implantable devices can help listen|date=2018-06-29|website=STAT|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Dagdeviren and fellow collaborators have designed an ingestible, flexible piezoelectric device that senses mechanical deformation within the gastric cavity. They demonstrated the capabilities of the sensor in both in vitro and ex vivo simulated gastric models, quantified its key behaviors in the gastrointestinal tract using computational modelling, and validated its functionality in awake and ambulating swine. The proof-of-concept device may lead to the development of ingestible piezoelectric devices that might safely sense mechanical variations and harvest mechanical energy inside the gastrointestinal tract for the diagnosis and treatment of motility disorders, as well as for monitoring ingestion in bariatric applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/project3.html|title=Conformable Decoders|website=conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic Textile Conformable Suit (E-TeCS) ===\n[[File:E-TeCS.jpg|thumb|120x120px|E-TeCS]]\nIn 2020, Dagdeviren and her team created a tailored, electronic textile conformable suit [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41528-020-0068-y (E-TeCS)] to perform large-scale, multi-modal physiological (temperature, heart rate, and respiration) sensing ''in vivo'' <ref>{{cite web|title=Sensors woven into a shirt can monitor vital signs|url=http://news.mit.edu/2020/sensors-monitor-vital-signs-0423|last=Trafton|first=Anne|date=2020-04-23|website=MIT News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>. The rapid advancement of electronic devices and fabrication technologies has further promoted the field of wearables and smart textiles. However, most of the current efforts in textile electronics focus on a single modality and cover a small area. E-TeCS introduces a new platform of modular, conformable (i.e., flexible and stretchable) distributed sensor networks that can be embedded into digitally-knit textiles. This platform can be customized for various forms, sizes and functions using standard, accessible and high-throughput textile manufacturing and garment patterning techniques.\n\n=== The Bees of Science ===\n[[File:0*yC2HEE0sPu1wZFDx.jpg|thumb|The Bees of Science|alt=|180x180px]]\nIn June 2019, Dagdeviren blended media, art, and science to create an exhibition which was featured in the lobby of the Media Lab for 8 months.
