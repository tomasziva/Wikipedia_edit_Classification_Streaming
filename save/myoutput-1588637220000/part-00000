The film was produced by [[David O. Selznick]] of [[Selznick International Pictures]] and directed by [[Victor Fleming]]. Set in the [[American South]] against the backdrop of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]], the film tells the story of [[Scarlett O'Hara]], the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner. It follows her romantic pursuit of [[Ashley Wilkes]], who is married to his cousin, [[Melanie Hamilton]], and her subsequent marriage to [[Rhett Butler]]. The leading roles are played by [[Vivien Leigh]] (Scarlett), [[Clark Gable]] (Rhett), [[Leslie Howard]] (Ashley), and [[Olivia de Havilland]] (Melanie).\n\nProduction was difficult from the start. Filming was delayed for two years because of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett Butler, and the \"search for Scarlett\" led to 1,400 women being interviewed for the part. The original screenplay was written by [[Sidney Howard]] and underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length. The original director, [[George Cukor]], was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming, who in turn was briefly replaced by [[Sam Wood]] while Fleming took some time off due to [[exhaustion]].\n\nThe film received positive reviews upon its release in December 1939, although some reviewers found it overlong. The casting was widely praised, and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett. At the [[12th Academy Awards]], it received ten [[Academy Awards]] (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Fleming), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Leigh), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Hattie McDaniel]], becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.\n\n''Gone with the Wind'' was immensely popular when first released. It became the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-earning film made up to that point]], and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|adjusted for monetary inflation]], it is still [[List of highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|the highest-grossing film in history]]. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is regarded as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]]; it has placed in the top ten of the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|top 100 American films]] since the list's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|inception in 1998]]. In 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Gone With the Wind Poster 1939.jpg|thumb|Scarlett and Rhett at the charity dance]]\nIn 1861, on the eve of the [[American Civil War]], [[Scarlett O'Hara]] lives at [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], her family's [[cotton plantation]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that [[Ashley Wilkes]], whom she secretly loves, is to be [[Cousin marriage|married to his cousin]], [[Melanie Hamilton]], and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation [[Twelve Oaks]]. At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett makes an advance on Ashley, but instead catches the attention of another guest, [[Rhett Butler]]. The barbecue is disrupted by news of the declaration of war, and the men rush to enlist. In a bid to arouse jealousy in Ashley, Scarlett marries Melanie's younger brother Charles before he leaves to fight. Following Charles's death while serving in the [[Confederate Army]], Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in [[Atlanta]], where she creates a scene by attending a charity bazaar in her mourning attire and waltzing with Rhett, now a [[blockade runner]] for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\nThe tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the [[Union Army]] in the [[Atlanta Campaign]], Melanie gives birth with Scarlett's aid, and Rhett helps them flee the city. Once out of the city, Rhett chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett to make her own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of [[typhoid fever]] and her father has become senile. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.\n\nAs the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father attempts to chase away a [[scalawag]] from his land, but is thrown from his horse and killed. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstructionist]] taxes imposed on Tara, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fianc\u00e9, the middle-aged and wealthy [[general store]] owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor. Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a [[shanty town]] after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts.\n\nRhett and Scarlett have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed. One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom.\n\nThe next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a [[miscarriage]]. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony. Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was him she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase. A distraught Scarlett resolves to return home to Tara, believing that one day she will get Rhett back.\n\n==Cast==\nDespite receiving top-[[Billing (filmmaking)|billing]] in the [[opening credits]], Gable\u2014along with Leigh, Howard, and de Havilland who receive second, third, and fourth billing respectively\u2014has a relatively low placing in the [[cast list]], due to its unusual structure. Rather than ordered by conventional billing, the cast is broken down into three sections: the Tara plantation, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta. The cast's names are ordered according to the social rank of the characters; therefore Thomas Mitchell, who plays Gerald O'Hara, leads the cast list as the head of the O'Hara family, while Barbara O'Neil as his wife receives the second credit and Vivien Leigh as the eldest daughter the third credit, despite having the most screen time. Similarly, Howard C. Hickman as John Wilkes is credited over Leslie Howard who plays his son, and Clark Gable, who plays only a visitor at Twelve Oaks, receives a relatively low credit in the cast list, despite being presented as the \"[[Movie star|star]]\" of the film in all the promotional literature.<ref name=\"AFIcatalog\">{{cite web |title=Gone With the Wind |work=[[The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/1181 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Following the death of Mary Anderson\u2014who played Maybelle Merriwether\u2014in April 2014, there are only two surviving credited cast members from the film: Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes; and Mickey Kuhn, who played her son, Beau.<ref>{{cite news |first=Claire |last=Noland |title=Mary Anderson Dies at 96; Actress had Role in 'Gone With the Wind' |date=April 8, 2014 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-mary-anderson-20140408-story.html |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col}}\n;Tara plantation\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Gerald O'Hara\n* [[Barbara O'Neil]] as Ellen O'Hara (his wife)\n* [[Vivien Leigh]] as [[Scarlett O'Hara]] (daughter)\n* [[Evelyn Keyes]] as Suellen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[Ann Rutherford]] as Carreen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[George Reeves]] as Brent Tarleton (actually as Stuart){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton|The credits at the start of the film contain an error: George Reeves is listed \"as Brent Tarleton\", but plays Stuart, while Fred Crane is listed \"as Stuart Tarleton\", but plays Brent.<ref name=AFIcatalog/>}}\n* [[Fred Crane (actor)|Fred Crane]] as Stuart Tarleton (actually as Brent){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton}}\n* [[Hattie McDaniel]] as Mammy (house servant)\n* [[Oscar Polk]] as Pork (house servant)\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Prissy (house servant)\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Jonas Wilkerson (field overseer)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as Big Sam (field foreman)\n;At Twelve Oaks\n* [[Howard Hickman]] as John Wilkes\n* [[Alicia Rhett]] as [[India Wilkes]] (his daughter)\n* [[Leslie Howard]] as [[Ashley Wilkes]] (his son)\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as [[Melanie Hamilton]] (their cousin)\n* [[Rand Brooks]] as [[Gone with the Wind (novel)#Other characters|Charles Hamilton]] (Melanie's brother)\n* [[Carroll Nye]] as Frank Kennedy (a guest)\n* [[Clark Gable]] as [[Rhett Butler]] (a visitor from Charleston)\n;In Atlanta\n* [[Laura Hope Crews]] as Aunt Pittypat Hamilton\n* [[Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson|Eddie Anderson]] as Uncle Peter (her coachman)\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Dr. Meade\n* [[Leona Roberts]] as Mrs. Meade\n* [[Jane Darwell]] as Mrs. Merriwether\n* [[Ona Munson]] as Belle Watling\n;Minor supporting roles\n* [[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]] as the Yankee deserter\n* [[Cammie King|Cammie King Conlon]] as Bonnie Blue Butler\n* [[J.

Mayer]] and [[Irving Thalberg]] at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), [[Pandro Berman]] at [[RKO Pictures]], and [[David O. Selznick]] of [[Selznick International Pictures]]. [[Jack L. Warner]] liked the story, but [[Warner Bros.]]'s biggest star [[Bette Davis]] was uninterested, and [[Darryl Zanuck]] of [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] did not offer enough money. Selznick changed his mind after his story editor [[Kay B. Barrett|Kay Brown]] and business partner [[John Hay Whitney]] urged him to buy the film rights. In July 1936\u2014a month after it was published\u2014Selznick bought the rights for $50,000.<ref name=\"Friedrich\">{{cite book |last=Friedrich |first=Otto |title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s |year=1986 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=978-0-520-20949-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cityofnetsportra00frie/page/17 17]\u201321  |url=https://archive.org/details/cityofnetsportra00frie/page/17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Book Purchase |work=Gone with the Wind Online Exhibit |location=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |publisher=[[Harry Ransom Center]] |url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/gwtw/book |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602124241/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/gwtw/book |archivedate=June 2, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Search for Scarlett: Chronology |work=Gone with the Wind Online Exhibit |location=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |publisher=[[Harry Ransom Center]] |url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/gwtw/scarlett/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602124241/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/gwtw/scarlett |archivedate=June 2, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh - Wind.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Publicity photo of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh as Rhett and Scarlett]]\nThe casting of the two lead roles became a complex, two-year endeavor.

It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht was in the middle of working on the film ''[[At the Circus]]'' for the [[Marx Brothers]]. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend [[Gene Fowler]], he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick and director Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They acted scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, \"After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me.

Warner Bros.\u2014who had contracted Steiner in 1936\u2014agreed to lend him to Selznick. Steiner spent twelve weeks working on the score, the longest period that he had ever spent writing one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it was also the longest that he had ever written. Five orchestrators were hired, including [[Hugo Friedhofer]], Maurice de Packh, Bernard Kaun, [[Adolph Deutsch]] and Reginald Bassett.\n\nThe score is characterized by two love themes, one for Ashley's and Melanie's sweet love and another that evokes Scarlett's passion for Ashley, though notably there is no Scarlett and Rhett love theme. Steiner drew considerably on folk and patriotic music, which included [[Stephen Foster]] tunes such as \"Louisiana Belle\", \"Dolly Day\", \"Ringo De Banjo\", \"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\", \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\", and \"Katie Belle\", which formed the basis of Scarlett's theme; other tunes that feature prominently are: \"Marching through Georgia\" by [[Henry Clay Work]], \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\", \"[[Garryowen (air)|Garryowen]]\", and \"[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]\". The theme that is most associated with the film today is the melody that accompanies Tara, the O'Hara plantation; in the early 1940s, \"Tara's Theme\" formed the musical basis of the song \"My Own True Love\" by [[Mack David]]. In all, there are ninety-nine separate pieces of music featured in the score.\n\nDue to the pressure of completing on time, Steiner received some assistance in composing from Friedhofer, Deutsch and [[Heinz Roemheld]], and in addition, two short cues\u2014by [[Franz Waxman]] and [[William Axt]]\u2014were taken from scores in the MGM library.<ref>{{cite book |first=Laurence E. |last=MacDonald |title=The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History |year=1998 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-1-880157-56-5 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT68 52]\u2013[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT69 53]}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Preview, premiere and initial release===\nOn September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, [[Irene Mayer Selznick|Irene]], investor [[Jock Whitney|John \"Jock\" Whitney]], and film editor Hal Kern drove out to [[Riverside, California]] to preview the film at the [[Riverside Fox Theater|Fox Theatre]].

''The Guardian'' believed that if \"the story had been cut short and tidied up at the point marked by the interval, and if the personal drama had been made subservient to a cinematic treatment of the central theme\u2014the collapse and devastation of the Old South\u2014then ''Gone With the Wind'' might have been a really great film\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news |title=From the Archive, 28 May 1940: Gone with the Wind at the Gaiety |date=May 28, 1940 |work=[[The Manchester Guardian]] |publication-date=May 28, 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/may/28/archive-gone-with-the-wind-1940 |accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref> Likewise, Hoellering also found the second half of the film to be weaker than the first half: identifying the Civil War to be the driving force of the first part while the characters dominate in the second part, he concluded this is where the main fault of the picture lay, commenting that \"the characters alone do not suffice\". Despite many excellent scenes, he considered the drama to be unconvincing and that the \"psychological development\" had been neglected.<ref name=\"Hoellering\" />\n\nMuch of the praise was reserved for the casting, with Vivien Leigh in particular being singled out for her performance as Scarlett.

He went on to dismiss it as a \"nostalgic plea for sympathy for a still living cause of Southern reaction\". Moss further criticized the stereotypical black characterizations, such as the \"shiftless and dull-witted Pork\", the \"indolent and thoroughly irresponsible Prissy\", Big Sam's \"radiant acceptance of slavery\", and Mammy with her \"constant haranguing and doting on every wish of Scarlett\".<ref name=\"Lupack\">{{cite book |first=Barbara Tepa |last=Lupack |title=Literary Adaptations in Black American Cinema: From Oscar Micheaux to Toni Morrison |year=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |isbn=978-1-58046-103-0 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hjO7_Ju7lWUC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209 209]\u2013211}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Hattie McDaniel's Oscar win, [[Walter Francis White]], leader of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], accused her of being an [[Uncle Tom]].

he hopes \"never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs\".<ref name=\"Schickel\" /><ref name=\"Kauffmann\" /> Both Schickel and [[Andrew Sarris]] identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being \"created\" or \"directed\", but rather having emerged \"steaming from the crowded kitchen\", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.<ref

sentimentality.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\" /> Kauffmann also finds interesting parallels with ''The Godfather'', which had just replaced ''Gone with the Wind'' as the highest-grosser at the time: both were produced from \"ultra-American\" best-selling novels, both live within codes of honor that are romanticized, and both in essence offer cultural fabrication or revisionism.<ref name=\"Kauffmann\"

Bryan Rommel Ruiz has argued that despite factual inaccuracies in its depiction of the Reconstruction period, ''Gone with the Wind'' nevertheless reflects contemporary interpretations that were common in the early 20th century. One such viewpoint is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends off a leering [[freedman]]: a government official can be heard offering bribes to the emancipated slaves for their votes. The inference is taken to be that freedmen are ignorant about politics and unprepared for freedom, unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt Reconstruction officials.\n\nWhile perpetuating some [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] myths, the film makes concessions in regard to others. After the attack on Scarlett in the shanty town, a group of men including Scarlett's husband Frank, Rhett Butler, and Ashley raid the town; in the novel they belong to the Ku Klux Klan, representing the common trope of protecting the white woman's virtue, but the filmmakers consciously neutralize the presence of the Klan in the film by referring to it only as a \"political meeting\".<ref name=\"Ruiz\">{{cite book |first=W.

In 1975, her brother, Stephens Mitchell (who assumed control of her estate), authorized a sequel to be jointly produced by MGM and [[Universal Studios]] on a budget of $12&nbsp;million. [[Anne Edwards]] was commissioned to write the sequel as a novel which would then be adapted into a screenplay, and published in conjunction with the film's release.

The film was produced by [[David O. Selznick]] of [[Selznick International Pictures]] and directed by [[Victor Fleming]]. Set in the [[American South]] against the backdrop of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]], the film tells the story of [[Scarlett O'Hara]], the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner. It follows her romantic pursuit of [[Ashley Wilkes]], who is married to his cousin, [[Melanie Hamilton]], and her subsequent marriage to [[Rhett Butler]]. The leading roles are played by [[Vivien Leigh]] (Scarlett), [[Clark Gable]] (Rhett), [[Leslie Howard]] (Ashley), and [[Olivia de Havilland]] (Melanie).\n\nProduction was difficult from the start. Filming was delayed for two years because of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett Butler, and the \"search for Scarlett\" led to 1,400 women being interviewed for the part. The original screenplay was written by [[Sidney Howard]] and underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length. The original director, [[George Cukor]], was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming, who in turn was briefly replaced by [[Sam Wood]] while Fleming took some time off due to [[exhaustion]].\n\nThe film received positive reviews upon its release in December 1939, although some reviewers found it overlong. The casting was widely praised, and many reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett. At the [[12th Academy Awards]], it received ten [[Academy Awards]] (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Fleming), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Leigh), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Hattie McDaniel]], becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.\n\n''Gone with the Wind'' was immensely popular when first released. It became the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-earning film made up to that point]], and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|adjusted for monetary inflation]], it is still [[List of highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|the highest-grossing film in history]]. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is regarded as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]]; it has placed in the top ten of the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|top 100 American films]] since the list's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|inception in 1998]]. In 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Gone With the Wind Poster 1939.jpg|thumb|Scarlett and Rhett at the charity dance]]\nIn 1861, on the eve of the [[American Civil War]], [[Scarlett O'Hara]] lives at [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], her family's [[cotton plantation]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that [[Ashley Wilkes]], whom she secretly loves, is to be [[Cousin marriage|married to his cousin]], [[Melanie Hamilton]], and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation [[Twelve Oaks]]. At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett makes an advance on Ashley, but instead catches the attention of another guest, [[Rhett Butler]]. The barbecue is disrupted by news of the declaration of war, and the men rush to enlist. In a bid to arouse jealousy in Ashley, Scarlett marries Melanie's younger brother Charles before he leaves to fight. Following Charles's death while serving in the [[Confederate Army]], Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in [[Atlanta]], where she creates a scene by attending a charity bazaar in her mourning attire and waltzing with Rhett, now a [[blockade runner]] for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\nThe tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the [[Union Army]] in the [[Atlanta Campaign]], Melanie gives birth with Scarlett's aid, and Rhett helps them flee the city. Once out of the city, Rhett chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett to make her own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of [[typhoid fever]] and her father has become senile. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.\n\nAs the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father attempts to chase away a [[scalawag]] from his land, but is thrown from his horse and killed. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstructionist]] taxes imposed on Tara, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fianc\u00e9, the middle-aged and wealthy [[general store]] owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor. Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a [[shanty town]] after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts.\n\nRhett and Scarlett have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed. One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom.\n\nThe next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a [[miscarriage]]. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony. Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was him she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase. A distraught Scarlett resolves to return home to Tara, believing that one day she will get Rhett back.\n\n==Cast==\nDespite receiving top-[[Billing (filmmaking)|billing]] in the [[opening credits]], Gable\u2014along with Leigh, Howard, and de Havilland who receive second, third, and fourth billing respectively\u2014has a relatively low placing in the [[cast list]], due to its unusual structure. Rather than ordered by conventional billing, the cast is broken down into three sections: the Tara plantation, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta. The cast's names are ordered according to the social rank of the characters; therefore Thomas Mitchell, who plays Gerald O'Hara, leads the cast list as the head of the O'Hara family, while Barbara O'Neil as his wife receives the second credit and Vivien Leigh as the eldest daughter the third credit, despite having the most screen time. Similarly, Howard C. Hickman as John Wilkes is credited over Leslie Howard who plays his son, and Clark Gable, who plays only a visitor at Twelve Oaks, receives a relatively low credit in the cast list, despite being presented as the \"[[Movie star|star]]\" of the film in all the promotional literature.<ref name=\"AFIcatalog\">{{cite web |title=Gone With the Wind |work=[[The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/1181 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Following the death of Mary Anderson\u2014who played Maybelle Merriwether\u2014in April 2014, there are only two surviving credited cast members from the film: Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes; and Mickey Kuhn, who played her son, Beau.<ref>{{cite news |first=Claire |last=Noland |title=Mary Anderson Dies at 96; Actress had Role in 'Gone With the Wind' |date=April 8, 2014 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-mary-anderson-20140408-story.html |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col}}\n;Tara plantation\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Gerald O'Hara\n* [[Barbara O'Neil]] as Ellen O'Hara (his wife)\n* [[Vivien Leigh]] as [[Scarlett O'Hara]] (daughter)\n* [[Evelyn Keyes]] as Suellen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[Ann Rutherford]] as Carreen O'Hara (daughter)\n* [[George Reeves]] as Brent Tarleton (actually as Stuart){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton|The credits at the start of the film contain an error: George Reeves is listed \"as Brent Tarleton\", but plays Stuart, while Fred Crane is listed \"as Stuart Tarleton\", but plays Brent.<ref name=AFIcatalog/>}}\n* [[Fred Crane (actor)|Fred Crane]] as Stuart Tarleton (actually as Brent){{refn|group=nb|name=Tarleton}}\n* [[Hattie McDaniel]] as Mammy (house servant)\n* [[Oscar Polk]] as Pork (house servant)\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Prissy (house servant)\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Jonas Wilkerson (field overseer)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as Big Sam (field foreman)\n;At Twelve Oaks\n* [[Howard Hickman]] as John Wilkes\n* [[Alicia Rhett]] as [[India Wilkes]] (his daughter)\n* [[Leslie Howard]] as [[Ashley Wilkes]] (his son)\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as [[Melanie Hamilton]] (their cousin)\n* [[Rand Brooks]] as [[Gone with the Wind (novel)#Other characters|Charles Hamilton]] (Melanie's brother)\n* [[Carroll Nye]] as Frank Kennedy (a guest)\n* [[Clark Gable]] as [[Rhett Butler]] (a visitor from Charleston)\n;In Atlanta\n* [[Laura Hope Crews]] as Aunt Pittypat Hamilton\n* [[Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson|Eddie Anderson]] as Uncle Peter (her coachman)\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Dr. Meade\n* [[Leona Roberts]] as Mrs. Meade\n* [[Jane Darwell]] as Mrs. Merriwether\n* [[Ona Munson]] as Belle Watling\n;Minor supporting roles\n* [[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]] as the Yankee deserter\n* [[Cammie King|Cammie King Conlon]] as Bonnie Blue Butler\n* [[J.

It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht was in the middle of working on the film ''[[At the Circus]]'' for the [[Marx Brothers]]. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend [[Gene Fowler]], he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick and director Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They acted scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, \"After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic.\"\n\nMacAdams writes, \"It is impossible to determine exactly how much Hecht scripted ... In the official credits filed with the [[Screen Writers Guild]], Sidney Howard was of course awarded the sole screen credit, but four other writers were appended ...

Steiner spent twelve weeks working on the score, the longest period that he had ever spent writing one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it was also the longest that he had ever written. Five orchestrators were hired, including [[Hugo Friedhofer]], Maurice de Packh, Bernard Kaun, [[Adolph Deutsch]] and Reginald Bassett.\n\nThe score is characterized by two love themes, one for Ashley's and Melanie's sweet love and another that evokes Scarlett's passion for Ashley, though notably there is no Scarlett and Rhett love theme. Steiner drew considerably on folk and patriotic music, which included [[Stephen Foster]] tunes such as \"Louisiana Belle\", \"Dolly Day\", \"Ringo De Banjo\", \"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\", \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\", and \"Katie Belle\", which formed the basis of Scarlett's theme; other tunes that feature prominently are: \"Marching through Georgia\" by [[Henry Clay Work]], \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\", \"[[Garryowen (air)|Garryowen]]\", and \"[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]\". The theme that is most associated with the film today is the melody that accompanies Tara, the O'Hara plantation; in the early 1940s, \"Tara's Theme\" formed the musical basis of the song \"My Own True Love\" by [[Mack David]]. In all, there are ninety-nine separate pieces of music featured in the score.\n\nDue to the pressure of completing on time, Steiner received some assistance in composing from Friedhofer, Deutsch and [[Heinz Roemheld]], and in addition, two short cues\u2014by [[Franz Waxman]] and [[William Axt]]\u2014were taken from scores in the MGM library.<ref>{{cite book |first=Laurence E. |last=MacDonald |title=The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History |year=1998 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-1-880157-56-5 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT68 52]\u2013[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQGbUd83MhYC&pg=PT69 53]}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Preview, premiere and initial release===\nOn September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, [[Irene Mayer Selznick|Irene]], investor [[Jock Whitney|John \"Jock\" Whitney]], and film editor Hal Kern drove out to [[Riverside, California]] to preview the film at the [[Riverside Fox Theater|Fox Theatre]].

''The Guardian'' believed that if \"the story had been cut short and tidied up at the point marked by the interval, and if the personal drama had been made subservient to a cinematic treatment of the central theme\u2014the collapse and devastation of the Old South\u2014then ''Gone With the Wind'' might have been a really great film\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news |title=From the Archive, 28 May 1940: Gone with the Wind at the Gaiety |date=May 28, 1940 |work=[[The Manchester Guardian]] |publication-date=May 28, 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/may/28/archive-gone-with-the-wind-1940 |accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref> Likewise, Hoellering also found the second half of the film to be weaker than the first half: identifying the Civil War to be the driving force of the first part while the characters dominate in the second part, he concluded this is where the main fault of the picture lay, commenting that \"the characters alone do not suffice\".

he hopes \"never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs\".<ref name=\"Schickel\" /><ref name=\"Kauffmann\" /> Both Schickel and [[Andrew Sarris]] identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being \"created\" or \"directed\",

its epic theme, but\u2014finding agreement with the film's contemporary criticisms\u2014the personal lives take over in the second half, and it ends up losing its theme in unconvincing sentimentality.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\" /> Kauffmann also finds interesting parallels with ''The Godfather'', which had just replaced ''Gone with the Wind'' as the highest-grosser at the time: both were produced from \"ultra-American\" best-selling novels, both live within codes of honor that are romanticized, and both in essence offer cultural fabrication or revisionism.<ref name=\"Kauffmann\"

Bryan Rommel Ruiz has argued that despite factual inaccuracies in its depiction of the Reconstruction period, ''Gone with the Wind'' nevertheless reflects contemporary interpretations that were common in the early 20th century. One such viewpoint is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends off a leering [[freedman]]: a government official can be heard offering bribes to the emancipated slaves for their votes. The inference is taken to be that freedmen are ignorant about politics and unprepared for freedom, unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt Reconstruction officials.\n\nWhile perpetuating some [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] myths, the film makes concessions in regard to others. After the attack on Scarlett in the shanty town, a group of men including Scarlett's husband Frank, Rhett Butler, and Ashley raid the town; in the novel they belong to the Ku Klux Klan, representing the common trope of protecting the white woman's virtue, but the filmmakers consciously neutralize the presence of the Klan in the film by referring to it only as a \"political meeting\".<ref name=\"Ruiz\">{{cite book |first=W.

Mitchell continued to resist pressure from Selznick and MGM to write a sequel until her death in 1949. In 1975, her brother, Stephens Mitchell (who assumed control of her estate), authorized a sequel to be jointly produced by MGM and [[Universal Studios]] on a budget of $12&nbsp;million. [[Anne Edwards]] was commissioned to write the sequel as a novel which would then be adapted into a screenplay, and published in conjunction with the film's release. Edwards submitted a 775-page manuscript entitled ''Tara, The Continuation of Gone with the Wind'', set between 1872 and 1882 focusing on Scarlett's divorce from Rhett; MGM was not satisfied with the story and the deal collapsed.<ref name=\"Bartel\" />\n\nThe idea was revived in the 1990s, when a sequel was finally produced in 1994, in the form of a television [[miniseries]]. ''[[Scarlett (miniseries)|Scarlett]]'' was based upon [[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|the novel]] by [[Alexandra Ripley]], itself a sequel to Mitchell's book. British actors [[Joanne Whalley]] and [[Timothy Dalton]] were cast as Scarlett and Rhett, and the series follows Scarlett's relocation to Ireland after again becoming pregnant by Rhett.<ref name=\"scarlett\">{{cite web |title=Scarlett (1994) |work=[[Allmovie]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/scarlett-v135447 |accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring slavery]]\n\n==References==\n===Explanatory notes===\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book |last=Bridges |first=Herb |year=1999 |title=Gone with the Wind: The Three-Day Premiere in Atlanta |publisher=[[Mercer University Press]] |isbn=978-0-86554-672-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/gonewithwindthre00brid}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Judy |last2=Christman |first2=Paul J |year=1989 |title=The Art of Gone with the Wind: The Making of a Legend |url=https://archive.org/details/artofgonewithwin0000came |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0-13-046740-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |authorlink=Aljean Harmetz |year=1996 |title=On the Road to Tara: The Making of Gone with the Wind |location=New York |publisher=[[Harry N.
