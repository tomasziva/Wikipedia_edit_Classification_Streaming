The law school offered a two-year departmental program, and changed locations between downtown Nashville and the Vanderbilt campus. By 1941, it had expanded into the old chapel area of Kirkland Hall on the Vanderbilt campus, but faced very limited enrollment during [[World War II]]. Classes were suspended in 1944.\n[[Image:Vandy-Kirkland-2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|left|VLS was based in Kirkland Hall from 1944 to 1962.]]\nVanderbilt Law School was revived with a $1 million endowment in 1947 and experienced significant growth through the 1960s. Facing overcrowding, in 1962, it moved out of Kirkland Hall and into a dedicated law school building on 21st Avenue South, where it is still located.\n\nSince then, VLS has undergone a series of renovations and expansion, notably including a $24 million upgrade under then-dean [[Kent D. Syverud]] completed in 2002.\n\nBy 2000, VLS had established a Law & Business Program, new clinical programs, multiple law journals, and an LL.M. program for foreign lawyers. At this point, Vanderbilt had greatly solidified its regional prestige and was well on its way to aggressively developing a national reputation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/about-the-school/history/index.aspx |title=Vanderbilt Law School :: History |publisher=Law.vanderbilt.edu |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2012-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030327/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/about-the-school/history/index.aspx |archive-date=2007-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Edward L. Rubin was appointed to replace Syverud as dean of the law school. During Dean Rubin's tenure, Vanderbilt Law School significantly developed its Litigation & Dispute and Resolution Program (resulting from a $2.9 million endowment donation), established or formalized a number of academic programs, and increased its reputation in the field of [[Law and Economics]] by establishing a Ph.D. Program in Law and Economics based within the law school and headed by noted economist [[W. Kip Viscusi]]; students earn both a J.D. and a Ph.D. through the program.\n\nChris Guthrie succeeded Rubin as the law school's dean in July 2009. In addition to its Law and Business and Litigation and Dispute Resolution Programs, the law school now offers programs in Intellectual Property Law; International Legal Studies; Energy, Environment and Land Use Law; Criminal Justice; Social Justice; and Law and Government. Vanderbilt University and the law school also offers a joint-degree law and neuroscience program in which students earn both a J.D. and Ph.D., and the school introduced a joint-degree J.D./M.S. in Finance in conjunction with Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management in fall 2014.\n\n==Culture==\nThe total enrollment of students pursuing either a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D) or [[LL.M.]] is approximately 640.  The program usually admits no more than 175 students to the J.D. class, and approximately 50 students to the LL.M class each year. VLS has more than 45 student organizations,<ref>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/student-resources/student-organizations/index.aspx</ref> which support many lectures, presentations and social events throughout the year. Students are also encouraged to form new organizations tailored to their personal interests, which has most recently produced Law Students for Social Justice (LSSJ), a new organization within the Social Justice Program that aims to facilitate an increasing number of students interested in pursuing public interest careers or hearing from legal practitioners on various ways to implement social justice values into their practice.\n\n==Programs==\n[[Image:VULS.JPG|thumb|Vanderbilt University Law School Building, Nashville, Tenn.]]\nVanderbilt's upper-level concentration programs allow students to earn a certificate in Law & Business as well as concentrate their studies in such fields as international law,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/international |title=Vanderbilt Law School :: International Legal Studies |publisher=Law.vanderbilt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref> intellectual property law; litigation and dispute resolution; energy, environmental and land use law; criminal law and  social justice. In 2005, the Cecil D. Branstetter Litigation & Dispute Resolution Program received a $2.9 million endowment through a [[cy pres]] settlement of a class action lawsuit. Vanderbilt also has programs that allow students to focus on intellectual property law; energy, environmental and land use law; international and comparative law; criminal justice; and social justice. In fall 2011, Vanderbilt University received a $4.85 million grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation <ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=439 |title=Vanderbilt Law School :: Article Detail |publisher=Law.vanderbilt.edu |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref> for the establishment of a national MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Law and Neuroscience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawneuro.org/ |title=MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Law and Neuroscience &#124; Vanderbilt University |publisher=Lawneuro.org |date=2012-11-25 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref>\n\nVanderbilt's [[Ph.D.]] Program in [[Law and economics|Law & Economics]] was the first program of its kind in the nation{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

The law school offered a two-year departmental program, and changed locations between downtown Nashville and the Vanderbilt campus. By 1941, it had expanded into the old chapel area of Kirkland Hall on the Vanderbilt campus, but faced very limited enrollment during [[World War II]]. Classes were suspended in 1944.\n[[Image:Vandy-Kirkland-2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|left|VLS was based in Kirkland Hall from 1944 to 1962.]]\nVanderbilt Law School was revived with a $1 million endowment in 1947 and experienced significant growth through the 1960s. Facing overcrowding, in 1962, it moved out of Kirkland Hall and into a dedicated law school building on 21st Avenue South, where it is still located.\n\nSince then, VLS has undergone a series of renovations and expansion, notably including a $24 million upgrade under then-dean [[Kent D. Syverud]] completed in 2002.\n\nBy 2000, VLS had established a Law & Business Program, new clinical programs, multiple law journals, and an LL.M. program for foreign lawyers. At this point, Vanderbilt had greatly solidified its regional prestige and was well on its way to aggressively developing a national reputation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/about-the-school/history/index.aspx |title=Vanderbilt Law School :: History |publisher=Law.vanderbilt.edu |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2012-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030327/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/about-the-school/history/index.aspx |archive-date=2007-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Edward L. Rubin was appointed to replace Syverud as dean of the law school. During Dean Rubin's tenure, Vanderbilt Law School significantly developed its Litigation & Dispute and Resolution Program (resulting from a $2.9 million endowment donation), established or formalized a number of academic programs, and increased its reputation in the field of [[Law and Economics]] by establishing a Ph.D. Program in Law and Economics based within the law school and headed by noted economist [[W. Kip Viscusi]]; students earn both a J.D. and a Ph.D. through the program.\n\nChris Guthrie succeeded Rubin as the law school's dean in July 2009. In addition to its Law and Business and Litigation and Dispute Resolution Programs, the law school now offers programs in Intellectual Property Law; International Legal Studies; Energy, Environment and Land Use Law; Criminal Justice; Social Justice; and Law and Government. Vanderbilt University and the law school also offers a joint-degree law and neuroscience program in which students earn both a J.D. and Ph.D., and the school introduced a joint-degree J.D./M.S. in Finance in conjunction with Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management in fall 2014.\n\n==Culture==\nThe total enrollment of students pursuing either a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D) or [[LL.M.]] is approximately 640.  The program usually admits no more than 175 students to the J.D. class, and approximately 50 students to the LL.M class each year. VLS has more than 45 student organizations,<ref>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/student-resources/student-organizations/index.aspx</ref> which support many lectures, presentations and social events throughout the year. Students are also encouraged to form new organizations tailored to their personal interests, which has most recently produced Law Students for Social Justice (LSSJ), a new organization within the Social Justice Program that aims to facilitate an increasing number of students interested in pursuing public interest careers or hearing from legal practitioners on various ways to implement social justice values into their practice.\n\n==Programs==\n[[Image:VULS.JPG|thumb|Vanderbilt University Law School Building, Nashville, Tenn.]]\nVanderbilt's upper-level concentration programs allow students to earn a certificate in Law & Business as well as concentrate their studies in such fields as international law,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/international |title=Vanderbilt Law School :: International Legal Studies |publisher=Law.vanderbilt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref> intellectual property law; litigation and dispute resolution; energy, environmental and land use law; criminal law and  social justice. In 2005, the Cecil D. Branstetter Litigation & Dispute Resolution Program received a $2.9 million endowment through a [[cy pres]] settlement of a class action lawsuit. Vanderbilt also has programs that allow students to focus on intellectual property law; energy, environmental and land use law; international and comparative law; criminal justice; and social justice. In fall 2011, Vanderbilt University received a $4.85 million grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation <ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=439 |title=Vanderbilt Law School :: Article Detail |publisher=Law.vanderbilt.edu |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref> for the establishment of a national MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Law and Neuroscience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawneuro.org/ |title=MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Law and Neuroscience &#124; Vanderbilt University |publisher=Lawneuro.org |date=2012-11-25 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref>\n\nVanderbilt's [[Ph.D.]] Program in [[Law and economics|Law & Economics]] was the first program of its kind in the nation{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.
