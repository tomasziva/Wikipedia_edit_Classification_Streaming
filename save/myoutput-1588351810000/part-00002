The [[legitimacy (political)#monarchy|legitimation]] and governing power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([[crowned republic]]), to restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]), to fully [[autocracy|autocratic]] ([[absolute monarchy]]), combining [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary|judicial]] power.\n\nIn most cases, the [[Order of succession|succession]] of monarchies is [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], often building [[dynasty|dynastic periods]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective]]<ref>Stuart Berg Flexure and Lenore Carry Hack, editors, ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'', 2nd Ed., Random House, New York (1993)</ref> and [[Self-proclaimed monarchy|self-proclaimed]] monarchies.

Republics\u2019 heads of state are often styled \"[[President (government title)|President]]\" or a variant thereof.\n\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 20th century. Forty-five sovereign nations in the world have a [[List of current sovereign monarchs|monarch]] as head of state, including sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s that each have Queen [[Elizabeth II]] (in separate capacities). Most modern monarchs are [[constitutional monarch]]s, who retain a unique legal and ceremonial role but exercise limited or no political power under the nation's constitution. In some nations, however, such as [[Brunei]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Eswatini]] and [[Thailand]], the hereditary monarch has more political influence than any other single source of authority in the nation, either by tradition or by a constitutional mandate.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{see|King (title)|Rex (title)|Realm}}\nThe word \"monarch\" ({{lang-la|monarchia|links=yes|label=Late Latin}}) comes from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|mon\u00e1rkh\u0113s}}), derived from {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|m\u00f3nos}}, \"one, single\") and {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9|\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|\u00e1rkh\u014d}}, \"to rule\") [compare {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd|\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|[[Archon|\u00e1rkh\u014dn]]}}, \"ruler, chief\")]. It referred to a single at least nominally absolute ruler. In current usage the word ''monarchy'' usually refers to a traditional system of hereditary rule, as elective monarchies are quite rare.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sumeriankinglist.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Weld-Blundell Prism]], inscribed with the [[Sumerian King List]], list of the oldest monarchs yet found]]\nThe similar form of societal hierarchy known as [[chiefdom]] or [[tribal kingship]] is prehistoric. The oldest recorded and evidenced monarch was [[Enmebaragesi]], a [[Sumer]]ian King of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] c. 2600 BCE.\n\nFrom earliest historical times, with the [[Pharaoh|Egyptian]] and [[Lugal|Mesopotamian]] monarchs as well as in reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], the king held [[sacral kingship|sacral functions]] directly connected to [[sacrifice]] or was considered by their people to have [[imperial cult|divine ancestry]]. In [[Germanic antiquity]], [[Germanic king|kingship]] was primarily a sacral function. The king was directly hereditary for some tribes, while for others he was elected from among eligible members of royal families by the [[thing (assembly)|thing]]. The role of the Roman emperor as the protector of [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity]] was conflated with the sacral aspects held by the [[Germanic king]]s to create the notion of the \"[[divine right of kings]]\" in the Christian Middle Ages. The [[Japanese emperor|Japanese]] and [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepalese]] monarchs continued to be considered [[List of people who have been considered deities|living Gods]] into the modern period.\n\n[[Polybius]] identified monarchy as one of three \"benign\" basic forms of government (monarchy, [[aristocracy]], and [[Democracy#Ancient origins|democracy]]), opposed to the three \"malignant\" basic forms of government ([[Tyrant|tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and [[ochlocracy]]). The monarch in classical antiquity is often identified as \"[[king (title)|king]]\" or \"ruler\" (translating ''[[archon]]'', ''[[basileus]]'', ''[[rex (title)|rex]]'', ''[[Tyrant|tyrannos]]'', etc.) or as \"[[Queen regnant|queen]]\" (''[[basilinna]]''). Polybius originally understood monarchy{{NoteTag|Now substituted with the concept of [[autocracy]].}} as a component of republics, but since antiquity monarchy has contrasted with forms of republic, where executive power is wielded by free citizens and their assemblies. In antiquity, some monarchies were [[Abolished monarchy|abolished]] in favour of such assemblies in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] ([[Roman Republic]], 509 BCE), and [[Ancient Athens|Athens]] ([[Athenian democracy]], 500 BCE).\n\nMonarchy has been challenged by evolving [[parliamentarism]] e.g. through regional assemblies (such as the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], the Swiss ''[[Landsgemeinde]]'' and later ''[[Tagsatzung]]'', and the High Medieval [[Medieval commune|communal movement]] linked to the rise of medieval [[town privileges]]) and by modern anti-monarchism e.g. of the temporary overthrow of the [[English monarchy]] by the [[Parliament of England]] in 1649,  the [[American Revolution]] of 1776 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. One of many opponents of that trend was [[Elizabeth Dawbarn]], whose anonymous ''Dialogue between Clara Neville and Louisa Mills, on Loyalty'' (1794) features \"silly Louisa, who admires liberty, [[Tom Paine]] and the USA, [who is] lectured by Clara on God's approval of monarchy\" and on the influence women can exert on men.<ref>''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', ed. Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 272.</ref> Advocacy of the abolition of a monarchy or respectively of republics has been called [[republicanism]], while the advocacy of monarchies is called [[monarchism]].\n\nMuch of 19th-century politics featured a division between diverse [[republicanism]] (such as anti-monarchist [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]]) and [[Conservativism|conservative]] or [[reactionary]] [[monarchism]].  In the following 20th century many countries [[abolished monarchy]] and became [[republic]]s, especially in the wake of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Monarchies today continue to exist often as so-called [[crowned republic]]s and survived particularly in small states.<ref>W. Veenendaal, \"Monarchy and Democracy in Small States: An Ambiguous Symbiosis,\" in S.

Malaysia\u2019s head of state, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (often translated as \"King\"), is elected to serve a five-year term. However, he is elected from among the federation\u2019s subnational monarchies, each of whom inherit their position and rule for life.}} and the responsibilities and power of the position pass to their child or another member of their family when they die. Most monarchs, both historically and in the modern-day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]], the centre of the [[royal household]] and [[Noble court|court]]. Growing up in a royal family (called a [[dynasty]] when it continues for several [[generation]]s), [[heir apparent|future monarchs]] are often trained for their expected future responsibilities as monarch.\n\nDifferent systems of hereditary [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]], [[primogeniture]], and [[agnatic seniority]] ([[Salic law]]). While most monarchs in history have been male, many female monarchs also have reigned. The term \"[[queen regnant]]\" refers to a ruling monarch, while \"[[queen consort]]\" refers to the wife of a reigning king. Rule may be hereditary in practice without being considered a monarchy: there have been some [[family dictatorship]]s{{NoteTag |Examples are [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Richard Cromwell]] in the [[Commonwealth of England]], [[Kim il-Sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]], the [[Somoza family]] in [[Nicaragua]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] and [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] in [[Haiti]], and [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[Bashar al-Assad]] in [[Syria]].}} (and also [[Political family|political families]]) in many [[Democracy|democracies]].{{NoteTag |For example, the [[Kennedy family]] in the United States and the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]] in [[India]]. See [[list of political families]].}}\n\nThe principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of leadership (as evidenced in the classic phrase \"[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]\").\n\nSome monarchies are not hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], monarchs are [[Election|elected]] or appointed by some body (an [[electoral college]]) for life or a defined period. Four elective monarchies exist today: [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] are 20th-century creations, while one (the [[Pope|papacy]]) is ancient.<ref>https://www.theclassroom.com/definition-elective-monarchy-5221.html</ref>\n\nA [[self-proclaimed monarchy]] is established when a person claims the monarchy without any historical ties to a previous dynasty. There are examples of republican leaders who have proclaimed themselves monarchs: [[Napoleon I of France]] declared himself [[List of French monarchs|Emperor of the French]] and ruled the [[First French Empire]] after having held the title of [[First Consul]] of the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] for five years from his seizing power in the coup of [[18 Brumaire]]. President [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]] declared himself Emperor of the [[Central African Empire]] in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/the-central-african-republic-where-emperor-bokassa-ruled-with-violence-and-greed-1.1750805|title=The Central African Republic, where Emperor Bokassa ruled with violence and greed|last=Marlowe|first=Lara|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> [[Yuan Shikai]], the first formal President of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], crowned himself Emperor of the short-lived \"[[Empire of China (1915\u20131916)|Empire of China]]\" a few years after the Republic of China was founded.<ref>Spence, Jonathan D.

Absolute monarchies are not necessarily [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]].\n\n* In a [[constitutional monarchy]], the monarch's power is subject to a [[constitution]]. In most current constitutional monarchies, the monarch is mainly a ceremonial [[figurehead]] [[symbol]] of national unity and state continuity. Although nominally [[sovereignty|sovereign]], the electorate (through the [[legislature]]) exercises political sovereignty. Constitutional monarchs' [[political power]] is limited. Typical monarchical powers include granting [[pardon]]s, granting [[honour system|honours]], and [[reserve power]]s, e.g. to dismiss the [[prime minister]], refuse to dissolve parliament, or [[veto]] legislation (\"withhold [[Royal Assent]]\"). They often also have privileges of inviolability and [[sovereign immunity]]. A monarch's powers and influence will depend on tradition, precedent, popular opinion, and [[law]]. \n**[[Semi-constitutional monarchy|Semi-constitutional monarchies]] exhibit fewer parliamentary powers or simply monarchs with more authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=30190&EventID=95 |title=Semi presidential systems and semi constitutional monarchies: A historical assessment of executive power-sharing |last1=Anckar|first1=Carsten|last2=Akademi|first2=\u00c5bo |date=2016|publisher=European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) |accessdate=2019-08-14}}</ref> The term \"[[parliamentary monarchy]]\" may be used to differentiate from semi-constitutional monarchies.\n\n* Monarchical reign has often been linked with [[Military dictatorship|military authority]]. In the late [[Roman Empire]], the [[Praetorian Guard]] several times deposed [[Roman Emperor]]s and installed new emperors. Similarly, in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the [[Ghilman|Ghilmans]] (slave soldiers) deposed Caliphs once they became prominent, allowing new ones to come to power. The Hellenistic kings of [[Macedon]] and of [[Epirus]] were elected by the army, which was similar in composition to the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' of [[democracies]], the council of all free citizens; military service was often linked with citizenship among the male members of the royal house. The military has dominated the monarch in modern [[Thailand]] and in [[medieval Japan]] (where a hereditary military chief, the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'', was the ''de facto'' ruler, although the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperor]] nominally reigned). In [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]], the [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] monarchy under King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] coexisted with the [[Italian Fascist Party|Fascist]] single-party rule of [[Benito Mussolini]]; [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] under the [[Iron Guard]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] during the first months of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Colonels' regime]] were similar. [[Spain under Franco|Spain under Francisco Franco]] was officially a monarchy, although there was no monarch on the throne. Upon his death, Franco was succeeded as head of state by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] heir, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], and [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain became a democracy]] with the king as a figurehead constitutional monarch.\n\n===Person of monarch===\n[[File:Ruling-monarchs.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of ruling monarchs, taken in 1908 between February (accession of [[Manuel II of Portugal|King Manuel II of Portugal]]) and November (death of [[Guangxu Emperor]])]]\n\nMost monarchies only have a single person acting as monarch at any given time, although two monarchs have ruled simultaneously in some countries, a situation known as [[diarchy]]. Historically this was the case in the ancient [[Greek city-state]] of [[Sparta]], 17th-century Russia, and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] from 1867 till its collapse in the wake of World War I.<ref>[https://hungarytoday.hu/day-1867-hungary-austria-establish-dual-monarchy-67321/] URL accessed, 11 December 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/oct/19/empire-breakup-europe-first-world-war-1918] URL Accessed, 11, December, 2018.</ref><ref>[https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/austria-hungary-facts] URL Accessed, 11, December, 2019.</ref> here are examples of joint sovereignty of spouses, parent and child or other relatives (such as [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II]] in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[tsar]]s [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] and [[Ivan V of Russia]], and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] and [[Joanna of Castile]]). \n\n[[Andorra]] currently is the world's only constitutional diarchy, a co-principality. Located in the [[Pyrenees]] between [[Spain]] and [[France]], it has two co-princes: the [[bishop of Urgell]] in Spain (a [[prince-bishop]]) and the [[president of France]] (derived ''ex officio'' from the French kings, who themselves inherited the title from the counts of Foix). It is the only situation in which an independent country's (co-)monarch is [[Democracy|democratically]] elected by the citizens of another country.\n\nIn a [[personal union]], separate independent states share the same person as monarch, but each realm retains separate laws and government. The sixteen separate [[Commonwealth realm]]s are sometimes described as being in a personal union with Queen Elizabeth II as monarch; however, they can also be described as being in a shared monarchy.\n\nA [[regent]] may rule when the monarch is a [[Minor (law)|minor]], absent, or debilitated.\n\nA [[pretender]] is a claimant to an abolished throne or a throne already occupied by somebody else.\n\n[[Abdication]] is the act of formally giving up one's monarchical power and status.\n\nMonarchs may mark the ceremonial beginning of their reigns with a [[coronation]] or [[enthronement]].\n\n===Role of monarch===\nMonarchy, especially absolute monarchy, is sometimes linked to [[Religion|religious]] aspects; many monarchs once claimed the right to rule by the will of a [[deity]] ([[Divine Right of Kings]], [[Mandate of Heaven]]), or a special connection to a deity ([[sacred king]]), or even purported to be divine kings, or [[incarnation]]s of deities themselves ([[imperial cult]]). Many European monarchs have been styled ''[[Fidei defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith); some hold official positions relating to the [[state religion]] or established church.\n\nIn the Western political tradition, a morally based, balanced monarchy was stressed as the ideal form of government, and little attention was paid to modern-day ideals of egalitarian democracy: e.g. [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] unapologetically declared: \"Tyranny is wont to occur not less but more frequently on the basis of polyarchy [rule by many, i.e. oligarchy or democracy] than on the basis of monarchy.\" (''On Kingship''). However, Thomas Aquinas also stated that the ideal monarchical system would also have at lower levels of government both an aristocracy and elements of democracy in order to create a balance of power. The monarch would also be subject to both natural and divine law, and to the [[Catholic Church|Church]] in matters of religion.\n\nIn [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''De Monarchia'', a spiritualised, imperial Catholic monarchy is strongly promoted according to a [[Ghibelline]] world-view in which the \"royal religion of [[Melchizedek]]\" is emphasised against the priestly claims of the rival papal ideology.\n\nIn [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[King of Saudi Arabia|king]] is a head of state who is both the absolute monarch of the country and the [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] of Islam (\u062e\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0646).\n\n===Titles of monarchs===\n[[File:T\u00e9wodros II - 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tewodros II]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]].]]\nMonarchs can have various [[title]]s. Common European titles of monarchs (in that hierarchical order of nobility) are [[emperor]] or [[empress]] (from [[Latin]]: [[imperator]] or imperatrix), [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[grand duke]] or [[grand duchess]], [[prince]] or [[princess]], [[duke]] or [[duchess]].<ref>Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982 vol.1 p21</ref> Some [[early modern]] European titles (especially in German states) included [[prince-elector|elector]] (German: {{Lang|de|Kurf\u00fcrst}}, Prince-Elector, literally \"electing prince\"), [[margrave]] (German: {{Lang|de|Markgraf}}, equivalent to the French title ''marquis'', literally \"count of the borderland\"), and [[burgrave]] (German: {{Lang|de|Burggraf}}, literally \"count of the castle\"). Lesser titles include [[count]] and [[princely count]]. Slavic titles include [[knyaz]] and [[tsar]] (\u0446\ufe22\u0440\u044c) or [[Tsarina|tsaritsa]] (\u0446\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430), a word derived from the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] title ''[[Caesar]]''.\n\nIn the [[Muslim world]], titles of monarchs include [[caliph]] (successor to the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and a leader of the entire Muslim community), [[padishah]] (emperor), [[sultan]] or [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], [[Shah|sh\u00e2hansh\u00e2h]] (emperor), [[shah]], [[malik]] (king) or [[malik]]ah (queen), [[emir]] (commander, prince) or [[emir]]a (princess), [[sheikh]] or [[sheikh]]a, [[imam]] (used in [[Oman]]). East Asian titles of monarchs include [[Emperor of China|''hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec'']] (emperor or empress regnant), [[Son of Heaven|''ti\u0101nz\u01d0'']] (son of heaven), ''[[Emperor of Japan|tenn\u014d]]'' (emperor) or ''[[Empress of Japan|josei tenn\u014d]]'' (empress regnant), ''[[Joseon|wang]]'' (king) or ''yeowang'' (queen regnant), ''[[Korean Empire|hwangje]]'' (emperor) or ''[[Korean Empire|yeohwang]]'' (empress regnant). South Asian and South East Asian titles included ''[[Maharaja|mah\u0101r\u0101ja]]'' ( high king) or ''maharani'' ( high queen), ''[[raja]]'' (king) and ''[[rana (title)|rana]]'' (king) or ''[[rani]]'' (queen) and ''ratu'' (South East Asian queen). Historically, [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] monarchs have used the title ''[[Khan (title)|khan]]'' and ''[[khagan]]'' (emperor) or ''[[khatun]]'' and ''[[khanum]]''; [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] monarchs have used the title ''[[pharaoh]]'' for men and women. In [[Ethiopian Empire]], monarchs used title ''[[Emperor of Ethiopia|n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st]]'' (king of kings) or [[Emperor of Ethiopia|n\u0259g\u0259st\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st]] (queen of kings).\n\nMany monarchs are addressed with particular [[Style (manner of address)|styles]] or manners of address, like \"[[Majesty]]\", \"[[Royal Highness]]\", \"[[By the Grace of God]]\", ''[[Amir al-Mu'minin|Am\u012br al-Mu'min\u012bn]]'' (\"Leader of the Faithful\"), ''[[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|H\u00fcnkar-i Khanedan-i \u00c2l-i Osman]]'', \"Sovereign of the Sublime House of Osman\"), ''[[Malay styles and titles|Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda]]'' (\"[[Majesty]]\"), ''Jeonha'' (\"[[Majesty]]\"), ''Tenn\u014d Heika'' (literally \"His Majesty the heavenly sovereign\"), ''B\u00ecxi\u00e0'' (\"Bottom of the Steps\").\n\nSometimes titles are used to express claims to territories that are not held in fact (for example, [[English claims to the French throne]]), or titles not recognised ([[antipope]]s). Also, after a monarchy is deposed, often former monarchs and their descendants are given alternative titles (the [[King of Portugal]] was given the hereditary title [[Duke of Braganza]]).\n\n===Dependent monarchies===\nIn some cases monarchs are dependent on other powers (see [[vassal]]s, [[suzerainty]], [[puppet state]], [[hegemony]]). In the British colonial era [[indirect rule]] under a [[paramount power]] existed, such as the [[princely state]]s under the [[British Raj]].\n\nIn [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]], [[Ghana]] and [[Uganda]], the ancient kingdoms and [[chiefdom]]s that were met by the colonialists when they first arrived on the continent are now constitutionally protected as regional or sectional entities. Furthermore, in [[Nigeria]], though the dozens of [[List of Nigerian traditional states|sub-regional polities]] that exist there are not provided for in the current constitution, they are nevertheless legally recognised aspects of the structure of governance that operates in the nation. In addition to these five countries, peculiar monarchies of varied sizes and complexities exist in various other parts of [[Africa]]. {{Specify|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Statehood===\nMonarchies pre-date [[polity|polities]] like [[nation state|nation states]]<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Rise of the Nation-State across the World, 1816 to 2001.|date=2010-10-08 |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=75 |issue=5 |doi= 10.1177/0003122410382639 |last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Feinstein|first2=Yuval|pages=764\u2013790|quote=Sovereignty has a domestic and an external component.

A [[nation]] or constitution is not necessary in a monarchy since a person, the monarch, binds the separate territories and [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] (e.g. in personal union) together.\n\n==Succession==\n===Hereditary monarchies===\n[[File:European monarchies by succession.svg|upright=0.94 |thumb |alt=Political Map of Europe with Monarchical states colour-coded |Current European monarchies by succession method:\n{{legend|#018571|[[Absolute primogeniture]]|size=94%}}\n{{legend|#dfc27d|[[Male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], to be changed to absolute primogeniture|size=94%}}\n{{legend|#a6611a|[[Male-preference cognatic primogeniture]]|size=94%}}\n{{legend|#000000|[[Agnatic primogeniture]]|size=94%}}\n{{legend|#f5f5f5|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]|size=94%}}]]\nIn a [[hereditary monarchy]], the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary [[order of succession]], usually within one [[royal family]] tracing its origin through a historical [[dynasty]] or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2000|title=The constitutional economics of autocratic succession|journal=Public Choice|volume=103|issue=1/2|pages=63\u201384|doi=10.1023/A:1005078532251|issn=0048-5829}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2004|title=Autocratic succession|journal=Encyclopedia of Public Choice|volume=103|pages=358\u2013362|doi=10.1007/978-0-306-47828-4_39|isbn=978-0-306-47828-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Primogeniture]], in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically \"agnatic primogeniture\" or \"patrilineal primogeniture\" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their issue, and [[patrilineality|male-line]] males inheriting before females of the male line.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Michael Dean|date=2001|title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts|publisher=[[University of Alabama|Anthropology.UA.edu]]|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm|accessdate=October 5, 2006}}</ref> This is the same as semi-Salic primogeniture. Complete exclusion of females from [[dynasty|dynastic]] succession is commonly referred to as application of the [[Salic law]] (see ''[[Terra salica]]'').\n\nBefore primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in [[coregency]]\u2014a senior king and a junior king. Examples were [[Henry the Young King]] of England and the early [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]] in France. Sometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line.\n\n[[File:Saksen-Koburg Leopold-2a.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|left|[[King of the Belgians|King]] [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], an elected founder of the hereditary [[monarchy of Belgium]]]]\n\nIn 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first European monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.<ref>SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronf\u00f6ljd'', p. 16.</ref> Other kingdoms (such as the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]]<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544 \"Overturning Centuries of Royal Rules\"] (2011-10-28). ''BBC.com''. Retrieved 2018-11-02.</ref> in 2011) have since followed suit. The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture (subject to the claims of existing heirs) on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32073399|title=New rules on royal succession come into effect|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn the absence of children, the next most senior member of the collateral line (for example, a younger sibling of the previous monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can mean that there are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture. This has often led, especially in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], to conflict between the principle of primogeniture and the principle of [[proximity of blood]].\n\nOther hereditary systems of succession included [[tanistry]], which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and [[Agnatic seniority]]. In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority). However, on June 21, 2017, King Salman of Saudi Arabi revolted against this style of monarchy and elected his son to inherit the throne.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chara|first=Jihan|date=2018-10-01|title=Saudi Arabia: A prince's revolution|journal=European View|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=227\u2013234|doi=10.1177/1781685818803525|issn=1781-6858|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Elective monarchies===\n{{unsourced section|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Pope Francis in March 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Francis]], Sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]]]\nIn an [[elective monarchy]], monarchs are [[Election|elected]] or appointed by somebody (an [[electoral college]]) for life or a defined period, but then reign like any other monarch. There is no popular vote involved in elective monarchies, as the elective body usually consists of a small number of eligible people. Historical examples of elective monarchy are the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. For example, [[Pepin the Short]] (father of [[Charlemagne]]) was elected [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]] by an assembly of Frankish leading men; nobleman [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] of Poland was an elected king, as was [[Frederick I of Denmark]]. [[Germanic peoples]] also had elective monarchies.\n\nSix forms of elective monarchies exist today. The [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (who rules as [[Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]) is [[Papal conclave|elected]] for life by the [[College of Cardinals]]. In the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], the [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Prince and Grand Master]] is elected for life tenure by the Council Complete of State from within its members. In [[Malaysia]], the federal king, called the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] or Paramount Ruler, is elected for a five-year term from among and by the hereditary rulers (mostly [[sultan]]s) of nine of the federation's constitutive [[States of Malaysia|states]], all on the [[Malay peninsula]]. The [[United Arab Emirates]] also chooses its federal leaders from among emirs of the federated states. Furthermore, [[Andorra]] has a unique constitutional arrangement as one of its heads of state is the President of the [[France|French Republic]] in the form of a [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]]. This is the only instance in the world where the monarch of a state is elected by the citizens of a different country. In New Zealand, the Maori King, head of the Kingitanga Movement, is elected by a council of Maori elders at the funeral of their predecessor, which is also where their coronation takes place. All of the Heads of the Maori King Movement have been descendants of the first Maori King, Potatau Te Wherowhero, who was elected and became King in June 1858. The current monarch is King [[T\u016bheitia Paki|Tuheitia Potatau Te Wherowhero VII]], who was elected and became King on 21 August 2006, the same day as the funeral of his mother, [[Te Atairangikaahu|Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu]], the first Maori Queen. As well as being King and head of the Kingitanga Movement, King Tuheitia is also ''ex officio'' the Paramount Chief of the Waikato-Tainui tribe.\n\nAppointment by the current monarch is another system, used in [[Jordan]]. It also was used in [[Imperial Russia]]; however, it was soon changed to semi-Salic because the instability of the appointment system resulted in [[History of Russia (1721\u201396)|an age of palace revolutions]]. In this system, the monarch chooses the successor, who is always his relative.\n\n{{see also|jure uxoris}}\n\n== Current monarchies ==\n{{Main article|List of current monarchs of sovereign states}}\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}\n{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}\n}}\n{|align=\"center\" style=\"background:transparent;\"\n| [[File:World Monarchies.svg|thumb|800px|<!--\n    -->{{legend|#AA0000|[[Absolute monarchy]]}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#D45500|Semi-constitutional monarchy}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#285F27|[[Constitutional monarchy]]}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#008000|[[Commonwealth realm]]s (constitutional monarchies in [[personal union]])}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#ff00ff|[[List of monarchies#Subnational monarchies|Subnational monarchies]] (traditional)}}\n]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\n{{Basic Forms of government}}\nCurrently, there are 44 nations and a population of roughly half a billion people in the world with a monarch as head of state. They fall roughly into the following categories:\n=== Commonwealth realms ===\n[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is, separately, monarch of sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s ([[Antigua and Barbuda]], the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], the [[The Bahamas|Commonwealth of the Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Canada]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Papua New Guinea|Independent State of Papua New Guinea]], the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]] and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]). They evolved out of the [[British Empire]] into fully independent states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that retain the Queen as head of state. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies where the Queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role. The Queen is head of the established [[Church of England]] in the United Kingdom, while the other 15 realms do not have an established church.\n=== Other European constitutional monarchies ===\nThe [[Principality of Andorra]], the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Norway]], the [[Kingdom of Spain]], and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role. In some cases, there is a Christian religion established as the official church in each of these countries. This is the Lutheran form of [[Protestantism]] in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, while Andorra is a [[Roman Catholic]] country. Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have no official state religion. Luxembourg, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, has five so-called ''officially recognised cults of national importance'' (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Greek Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Islam), a status which gives to those religions some privileges like the payment of a state salary to their priests.\n\nAndorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is a [[diarchy]], with the co-princeship being shared by the [[president of France]] and the [[bishop of Urgell]]. This situation, based on historical precedence, has created a peculiar situation among monarchies, as:\n*neither of the co-princes is of Andorran descent;\n* one is elected by citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French presidential elections; and\n*the other, the bishop of Urgel, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the pope.\n\n===European monarchies in which the monarch retains more powers===\nThe [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]] and the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] are constitutional monarchies in which the prince retains substantial powers. For example, the [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|2003 Constitution referendum]] gave the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] the power to veto any law that the [[Landtag]] (parliament) proposes, while the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The prince can appoint or dismiss any elective member or government employee. However, he is not an absolute monarch, as the people can call for a referendum to end the monarch's reign. When Hereditary Prince Alois threatened to veto a referendum to legalize abortion in 2011, it came as a surprise because the prince had not vetoed any law for over 30 years.{{NoteTag |In the end, this referendum failed to make it to a vote.}} The [[prince of Monaco]] has simpler powers; he cannot appoint or dismiss any elective member or government employee to or from his or her post, but he can elect the [[Minister of State of Monaco|minister of state]], [[Politics of Monaco|government council]] and judges. Both [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]], and [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein]], are theoretically very powerful within their small states, but they have very limited power compared to the Islamic monarchs (see below). They also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.\n\n===Islamic monarchies===\nThe Islamic monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]], the [[Nation of Brunei]], [[The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the [[State of Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Kingdom of Morocco]], the [[Sultanate of Oman]], the [[State of Qatar]], the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts. Brunei, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia remain absolute monarchies; Bahrain, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers; Jordan, Malaysia, and Morocco are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than European equivalents.\n\n===East and Southeast Asian constitutional monarchies===\nThe [[Kingdom of Bhutan]], the [[Kingdom of Cambodia]], the [[Kingdom of Thailand]] and [[Japan]] are constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or merely ceremonial role. Japan changed from traditional absolute monarchy into a constitutional one during the 20th century, and Bhutan made the change in 2008. Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from the [[French Colonial Empire]], but it was deposed after the [[Khmer Rouge]] came into power. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993. Thailand transitioned into a constitutional monarchy over the course of the 20th Century.\n\n===Other monarchies===\nFive monarchies do not fit into any of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] in [[Polynesia]]; the [[Kingdom of Eswatini]] and the [[Kingdom of Lesotho]] in Africa; the [[Vatican City State]] in Europe and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. Of these, Lesotho and Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while Eswatini and the Vatican City are absolute monarchies. Eswatini is unique among these monarchies, often being considered a [[diarchy]]: the King, or [[Ngwenyama]], rules alongside his mother, the [[Ndlovukati]], as dual heads of state (this was originally intended to provide a check on political power). The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which more or less has become symbolic in recent years. The [[Pope]] is the absolute monarch of the Vatican City State (a separate entity from the [[Holy See]]) by virtue of his position as head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Bishop of Rome; he is an elected rather than a hereditary ruler and does not have to be a citizen of the territory prior to his election by the cardinals. The Order of Malta describes itself as a \"sovereign subject\" based on its unique history and unusual present circumstances, but its exact status in international law is subject of debate. [[Samoa]], the position is described in Part III of the 1960 Samoan constitution. At the time the constitution was adopted, it was anticipated that future heads of state would be chosen from among the four Tama a 'Aiga \"royal\" paramount chiefs. However, this is not required by the constitution, so, for this reason, Samoa can be considered a republic rather than a [[constitutional monarchy]]. \n\nThe [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|ruling Kim family]] in [[North Korea]] ([[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and [[Kim Jong-un]]) has been described as a ''de facto'' [[absolute monarchy]]<ref>Young W.

Republics\u2019 heads of state are often styled \"[[President (government title)|President]]\" or a variant thereof.\n\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 20th century. Forty-five sovereign nations in the world have a [[List of current sovereign monarchs|monarch]] as head of state, including sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s that each have Queen [[Elizabeth II]] (in separate capacities). Most modern monarchs are [[constitutional monarch]]s, who retain a unique legal and ceremonial role but exercise limited or no political power under the nation's constitution. In some nations, however, such as [[Brunei]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Eswatini]] and [[Thailand]], the hereditary monarch has more political influence than any other single source of authority in the nation, either by tradition or by a constitutional mandate.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{see|King (title)|Rex (title)|Realm}}\nThe word \"monarch\" ({{lang-la|monarchia|links=yes|label=Late Latin}}) comes from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|mon\u00e1rkh\u0113s}}), derived from {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|m\u00f3nos}}, \"one, single\") and {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9|\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|\u00e1rkh\u014d}}, \"to rule\") [compare {{Lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd|\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd]]|size=80%}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|[[Archon|\u00e1rkh\u014dn]]}}, \"ruler, chief\")]. It referred to a single at least nominally absolute ruler. In current usage the word ''monarchy'' usually refers to a traditional system of hereditary rule, as elective monarchies are quite rare.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sumeriankinglist.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Weld-Blundell Prism]], inscribed with the [[Sumerian King List]], list of the oldest monarchs yet found]]\nThe similar form of societal hierarchy known as [[chiefdom]] or [[tribal kingship]] is prehistoric. The oldest recorded and evidenced monarch was [[Enmebaragesi]], a [[Sumer]]ian King of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] c. 2600 BCE.\n\nFrom earliest historical times, with the [[Pharaoh|Egyptian]] and [[Lugal|Mesopotamian]] monarchs as well as in reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], the king held [[sacral kingship|sacral functions]] directly connected to [[sacrifice]] or was considered by their people to have [[imperial cult|divine ancestry]]. In [[Germanic antiquity]], [[Germanic king|kingship]] was primarily a sacral function. The king was directly hereditary for some tribes, while for others he was elected from among eligible members of royal families by the [[thing (assembly)|thing]]. The role of the Roman emperor as the protector of [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity]] was conflated with the sacral aspects held by the [[Germanic king]]s to create the notion of the \"[[divine right of kings]]\" in the Christian Middle Ages. The [[Japanese emperor|Japanese]] and [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepalese]] monarchs continued to be considered [[List of people who have been considered deities|living Gods]] into the modern period.\n\n[[Polybius]] identified monarchy as one of three \"benign\" basic forms of government (monarchy, [[aristocracy]], and [[Democracy#Ancient origins|democracy]]), opposed to the three \"malignant\" basic forms of government ([[Tyrant|tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and [[ochlocracy]]). The monarch in classical antiquity is often identified as \"[[king (title)|king]]\" or \"ruler\" (translating ''[[archon]]'', ''[[basileus]]'', ''[[rex (title)|rex]]'', ''[[Tyrant|tyrannos]]'', etc.) or as \"[[Queen regnant|queen]]\" (''[[basilinna]]''). Polybius originally understood monarchy{{NoteTag|Now substituted with the concept of [[autocracy]].}} as a component of republics, but since antiquity monarchy has contrasted with forms of republic, where executive power is wielded by free citizens and their assemblies. In antiquity, some monarchies were [[Abolished monarchy|abolished]] in favour of such assemblies in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] ([[Roman Republic]], 509 BCE), and [[Ancient Athens|Athens]] ([[Athenian democracy]], 500 BCE).\n\nMonarchy has been challenged by evolving [[parliamentarism]] e.g. through regional assemblies (such as the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], the Swiss ''[[Landsgemeinde]]'' and later ''[[Tagsatzung]]'', and the High Medieval [[Medieval commune|communal movement]] linked to the rise of medieval [[town privileges]]) and by modern anti-monarchism e.g. of the temporary overthrow of the [[English monarchy]] by the [[Parliament of England]] in 1649,  the [[American Revolution]] of 1776 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. One of many opponents of that trend was [[Elizabeth Dawbarn]], whose anonymous ''Dialogue between Clara Neville and Louisa Mills, on Loyalty'' (1794) features \"silly Louisa, who admires liberty, [[Tom Paine]] and the USA, [who is] lectured by Clara on God's approval of monarchy\" and on the influence women can exert on men.<ref>''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', ed. Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 272.</ref> Advocacy of the abolition of a monarchy or respectively of republics has been called [[republicanism]], while the advocacy of monarchies is called [[monarchism]].\n\nMuch of 19th-century politics featured a division between diverse [[republicanism]] (such as anti-monarchist [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]]) and [[Conservativism|conservative]] or [[reactionary]] [[monarchism]].  In the following 20th century many countries [[abolished monarchy]] and became [[republic]]s, especially in the wake of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Monarchies today continue to exist often as so called [[crowned republic]]s and survived particularly in small states.<ref>W.

However, he is elected from among the federation\u2019s subnational monarchies, each of whom inherit their position and rule for life.}} and the responsibilities and power of the position pass to their child or another member of their family when they die. Most monarchs, both historically and in the modern-day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]], the centre of the [[royal household]] and [[Noble court|court]]. Growing up in a royal family (called a [[dynasty]] when it continues for several [[generation]]s), [[heir apparent|future monarchs]] are often trained for their expected future responsibilities as monarch.\n\nDifferent systems of hereditary [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]], [[primogeniture]], and [[agnatic seniority]] ([[Salic law]]). While most monarchs in history have been male, many female monarchs also have reigned. The term \"[[queen regnant]]\" refers to a ruling monarch, while \"[[queen consort]]\" refers to the wife of a reigning king. Rule may be hereditary in practice without being considered a monarchy: there have been some [[family dictatorship]]s{{NoteTag |Examples are [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Richard Cromwell]] in the [[Commonwealth of England]], [[Kim il-Sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]], the [[Somoza family]] in [[Nicaragua]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] and [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] in [[Haiti]], and [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[Bashar al-Assad]] in [[Syria]].}} (and also [[Political family|political families]]) in many [[Democracy|democracies]].{{NoteTag |For example, the [[Kennedy family]] in the United States and the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]] in [[India]]. See [[list of political families]].}}\n\nThe principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of leadership (as evidenced in the classic phrase \"[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]\").\n\nSome monarchies are not hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], monarchs are [[Election|elected]] or appointed by some body (an [[electoral college]]) for life or a defined period. Four elective monarchies exist today: [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] are 20th-century creations, while one (the [[Pope|papacy]]) is ancient.<ref>https://www.theclassroom.com/definition-elective-monarchy-5221.html</ref>\n\nA [[self-proclaimed monarchy]] is established when a person claims the monarchy without any historical ties to a previous dynasty. There are examples of republican leaders who have proclaimed themselves monarchs: [[Napoleon I of France]] declared himself [[List of French monarchs|Emperor of the French]] and ruled the [[First French Empire]] after having held the title of [[First Consul]] of the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] for five years from his seizing power in the coup of [[18 Brumaire]]. President [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]] declared himself Emperor of the [[Central African Empire]] in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/the-central-african-republic-where-emperor-bokassa-ruled-with-violence-and-greed-1.1750805|title=The Central African Republic, where Emperor Bokassa ruled with violence and greed|last=Marlowe|first=Lara|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> [[Yuan Shikai]], the first formal President of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], crowned himself Emperor of the short-lived \"[[Empire of China (1915\u20131916)|Empire of China]]\" a few years after the Republic of China was founded.<ref>Spence, Jonathan D.

Absolute monarchies are not necessarily [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]].\n\n* In a [[constitutional monarchy]], the monarch's power is subject to a [[constitution]]. In most current constitutional monarchies, the monarch is mainly a ceremonial [[figurehead]] [[symbol]] of national unity and state continuity. Although nominally [[sovereignty|sovereign]], the electorate (through the [[legislature]]) exercises political sovereignty. Constitutional monarchs' [[political power]] is limited. Typical monarchical powers include granting [[pardon]]s, granting [[honour system|honours]], and [[reserve power]]s, e.g. to dismiss the [[prime minister]], refuse to dissolve parliament, or [[veto]] legislation (\"withhold [[Royal Assent]]\"). They often also have privileges of inviolability and [[sovereign immunity]]. A monarch's powers and influence will depend on tradition, precedent, popular opinion, and [[law]]. \n**[[Semi-constitutional monarchy|Semi-constitutional monarchies]] exhibit fewer parliamentary powers or simply monarchs with more authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=30190&EventID=95 |title=Semi presidential systems and semi constitutional monarchies: A historical assessment of executive power-sharing |last1=Anckar|first1=Carsten|last2=Akademi|first2=\u00c5bo |date=2016|publisher=European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) |accessdate=2019-08-14}}</ref> The term \"[[parliamentary monarchy]]\" may be used to differentiate from semi-constitutional monarchies.\n\n* Monarchical reign has often been linked with [[Military dictatorship|military authority]]. In the late [[Roman Empire]], the [[Praetorian Guard]] several times deposed [[Roman Emperor]]s and installed new emperors. Similarly, in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the [[Ghilman|Ghilmans]] (slave soldiers) deposed Caliphs once they became prominent, allowing new ones to come to power. The Hellenistic kings of [[Macedon]] and of [[Epirus]] were elected by the army, which was similar in composition to the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' of [[democracies]], the council of all free citizens; military service was often linked with citizenship among the male members of the royal house. The military has dominated the monarch in modern [[Thailand]] and in [[medieval Japan]] (where a hereditary military chief, the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'', was the ''de facto'' ruler, although the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperor]] nominally reigned). In [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]], the [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] monarchy under King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] coexisted with the [[Italian Fascist Party|Fascist]] single-party rule of [[Benito Mussolini]]; [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] under the [[Iron Guard]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] during the first months of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Colonels' regime]] were similar. [[Spain under Franco|Spain under Francisco Franco]] was officially a monarchy, although there was no monarch on the throne. Upon his death, Franco was succeeded as head of state by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] heir, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], and [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain became a democracy]] with the king as a figurehead constitutional monarch.\n\n===Person of monarch===\n[[File:Ruling-monarchs.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of ruling monarchs, taken in 1908 between February (accession of [[Manuel II of Portugal|King Manuel II of Portugal]]) and November (death of [[Guangxu Emperor]])]]\n\nMost monarchies only have a single person acting as monarch at any given time, although two monarchs have ruled simultaneously in some countries, a situation known as [[diarchy]]. Historically this was the case in the ancient [[Greek city-state]] of [[Sparta]], 17th-century Russia, and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] from 1867 till its collapse in the wake of World War I.<ref>[https://hungarytoday.hu/day-1867-hungary-austria-establish-dual-monarchy-67321/] URL accessed, 11 December 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/oct/19/empire-breakup-europe-first-world-war-1918] URL Accessed, 11, December, 2018.</ref><ref>[https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/austria-hungary-facts] URL Accessed, 11, December, 2019.</ref> here are examples of joint sovereignty of spouses, parent and child or other relatives (such as [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II]] in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[tsar]]s [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] and [[Ivan V of Russia]], and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] and [[Joanna of Castile]]). \n\n[[Andorra]] currently is the world's only constitutional diarchy, a co-principality. Located in the [[Pyrenees]] between [[Spain]] and [[France]], it has two co-princes: the [[bishop of Urgell]] in Spain (a [[prince-bishop]]) and the [[president of France]] (derived ''ex officio'' from the French kings, who themselves inherited the title from the counts of Foix). It is the only situation in which an independent country's (co-)monarch is [[Democracy|democratically]] elected by the citizens of another country.\n\nIn a [[personal union]], separate independent states share the same person as monarch, but each realm retains separate laws and government. The sixteen separate [[Commonwealth realm]]s are sometimes described as being in a personal union with Queen Elizabeth II as monarch; however, they can also be described as being in a shared monarchy.\n\nA [[regent]] may rule when the monarch is a [[Minor (law)|minor]], absent, or debilitated.\n\nA [[pretender]] is a claimant to an abolished throne or a throne already occupied by somebody else.\n\n[[Abdication]] is the act of formally giving up one's monarchical power and status.\n\nMonarchs may mark the ceremonial beginning of their reigns with a [[coronation]] or [[enthronement]].\n\n===Role of monarch===\nMonarchy, especially absolute monarchy, is sometimes linked to [[Religion|religious]] aspects; many monarchs once claimed the right to rule by the will of a [[deity]] ([[Divine Right of Kings]], [[Mandate of Heaven]]), or a special connection to a deity ([[sacred king]]), or even purported to be divine kings, or [[incarnation]]s of deities themselves ([[imperial cult]]). Many European monarchs have been styled ''[[Fidei defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith); some hold official positions relating to the [[state religion]] or established church.\n\nIn the Western political tradition, a morally based, balanced monarchy was stressed as the ideal form of government, and little attention was paid to modern-day ideals of egalitarian democracy: e.g. [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] unapologetically declared: \"Tyranny is wont to occur not less but more frequently on the basis of polyarchy [rule by many, i.e. oligarchy or democracy] than on the basis of monarchy.\" (''On Kingship''). However, Thomas Aquinas also stated that the ideal monarchical system would also have at lower levels of government both an aristocracy and elements of democracy in order to create a balance of power. The monarch would also be subject to both natural and divine law, and to the [[Catholic Church|Church]] in matters of religion.\n\nIn [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''De Monarchia'', a spiritualised, imperial Catholic monarchy is strongly promoted according to a [[Ghibelline]] world-view in which the \"royal religion of [[Melchizedek]]\" is emphasised against the priestly claims of the rival papal ideology.\n\nIn [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[King of Saudi Arabia|king]] is a head of state who is both the absolute monarch of the country and the [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] of Islam (\u062e\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0646).\n\n===Titles of monarchs===\n[[File:T\u00e9wodros II - 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tewodros II]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]].]]\nMonarchs can have various [[title]]s. Common European titles of monarchs (in that hierarchical order of nobility) are [[emperor]] or [[empress]] (from [[Latin]]: [[imperator]] or imperatrix), [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[grand duke]] or [[grand duchess]], [[prince]] or [[princess]], [[duke]] or [[duchess]].<ref>Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982 vol.1 p21</ref> Some [[early modern]] European titles (especially in German states) included [[prince-elector|elector]] (German: {{Lang|de|Kurf\u00fcrst}}, Prince-Elector, literally \"electing prince\"), [[margrave]] (German: {{Lang|de|Markgraf}}, equivalent to the French title ''marquis'', literally \"count of the borderland\"), and [[burgrave]] (German: {{Lang|de|Burggraf}}, literally \"count of the castle\"). Lesser titles include [[count]] and [[princely count]]. Slavic titles include [[knyaz]] and [[tsar]] (\u0446\ufe22\u0440\u044c) or [[Tsarina|tsaritsa]] (\u0446\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430), a word derived from the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] title ''[[Caesar]]''.\n\nIn the [[Muslim world]], titles of monarchs include [[caliph]] (successor to the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and a leader of the entire Muslim community), [[padishah]] (emperor), [[sultan]] or [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], [[Shah|sh\u00e2hansh\u00e2h]] (emperor), [[shah]], [[malik]] (king) or [[malik]]ah (queen), [[emir]] (commander, prince) or [[emir]]a (princess), [[sheikh]] or [[sheikh]]a, [[imam]] (used in [[Oman]]). East Asian titles of monarchs include [[Emperor of China|''hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec'']] (emperor or empress regnant), [[Son of Heaven|''ti\u0101nz\u01d0'']] (son of heaven), ''[[Emperor of Japan|tenn\u014d]]'' (emperor) or ''[[Empress of Japan|josei tenn\u014d]]'' (empress regnant), ''[[Joseon|wang]]'' (king) or ''yeowang'' (queen regnant), ''[[Korean Empire|hwangje]]'' (emperor) or ''[[Korean Empire|yeohwang]]'' (empress regnant). South Asian and South East Asian titles included ''[[Maharaja|mah\u0101r\u0101ja]]'' ( high king) or ''maharani'' ( high queen), ''[[raja]]'' (king) and ''[[rana (title)|rana]]'' (king) or ''[[rani]]'' (queen) and ''ratu'' (South East Asian queen). Historically, [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] monarchs have used the title ''[[Khan (title)|khan]]'' and ''[[khagan]]'' (emperor) or ''[[khatun]]'' and ''[[khanum]]''; [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] monarchs have used the title ''[[pharaoh]]'' for men and women. In [[Ethiopian Empire]], monarchs used title ''[[Emperor of Ethiopia|n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st]]'' (king of kings) or [[Emperor of Ethiopia|n\u0259g\u0259st\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st]] (queen of kings).\n\nMany monarchs are addressed with particular [[Style (manner of address)|styles]] or manners of address, like \"[[Majesty]]\", \"[[Royal Highness]]\", \"[[By the Grace of God]]\", ''[[Amir al-Mu'minin|Am\u012br al-Mu'min\u012bn]]'' (\"Leader of the Faithful\"), ''[[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|H\u00fcnkar-i Khanedan-i \u00c2l-i Osman]]'', \"Sovereign of the Sublime House of Osman\"), ''[[Malay styles and titles|Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda]]'' (\"[[Majesty]]\"), ''Jeonha'' (\"[[Majesty]]\"), ''Tenn\u014d Heika'' (literally \"His Majesty the heavenly sovereign\"), ''B\u00ecxi\u00e0'' (\"Bottom of the Steps\").\n\nSometimes titles are used to express claims to territories that are not held in fact (for example, [[English claims to the French throne]]), or titles not recognised ([[antipope]]s). Also, after a monarchy is deposed, often former monarchs and their descendants are given alternative titles (the [[King of Portugal]] was given the hereditary title [[Duke of Braganza]]).\n\n===Dependent monarchies===\nIn some cases monarchs are dependent on other powers (see [[vassal]]s, [[suzerainty]], [[puppet state]], [[hegemony]]). In the British colonial era [[indirect rule]] under a [[paramount power]] existed, such as the [[princely state]]s under the [[British Raj]].\n\nIn [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]], [[Ghana]] and [[Uganda]], the ancient kingdoms and [[chiefdom]]s that were met by the colonialists when they first arrived on the continent are now constitutionally protected as regional or sectional entities. Furthermore, in [[Nigeria]], though the dozens of [[List of Nigerian traditional states|sub-regional polities]] that exist there are not provided for in the current constitution, they are nevertheless legally recognised aspects of the structure of governance that operates in the nation. In addition to these five countries, peculiar monarchies of varied sizes and complexities exist in various other parts of [[Africa]]. {{Specify|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Statehood===\nMonarchies pre-date [[polity|polities]] like [[nation state|nation states]]<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Rise of the Nation-State across the World, 1816 to 2001.|date=2010-10-08 |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=75 |issue=5 |doi= 10.1177/0003122410382639 |last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Feinstein|first2=Yuval|pages=764\u2013790|quote=Sovereignty has a domestic and an external component. Domestically, a written constitution claims a nationally defined community of equal citizens as the political (and moral) foundation of the state and foresees some institutional representation of this community (not necessarily a freely elected parliament).

This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2000|title=The constitutional economics of autocratic succession|journal=Public Choice|volume=103|issue=1/2|pages=63\u201384|doi=10.1023/A:1005078532251|issn=0048-5829}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2004|title=Autocratic succession|journal=Encyclopedia of Public Choice|volume=103|pages=358\u2013362|doi=10.1007/978-0-306-47828-4_39|isbn=978-0-306-47828-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Primogeniture]], in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically \"agnatic primogeniture\" or \"patrilineal primogeniture\" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their issue, and [[patrilineality|male-line]] males inheriting before females of the male line.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Michael Dean|date=2001|title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts|publisher=[[University of Alabama|Anthropology.UA.edu]]|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm|accessdate=October 5, 2006}}</ref> This is the same as semi-Salic primogeniture. Complete exclusion of females from [[dynasty|dynastic]] succession is commonly referred to as application of the [[Salic law]] (see ''[[Terra salica]]'').\n\nBefore primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in [[coregency]]\u2014a senior king and a junior king. Examples were [[Henry the Young King]] of England and the early [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]] in France. Sometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line.\n\n[[File:Saksen-Koburg Leopold-2a.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|left|[[King of the Belgians|King]] [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], an elected founder of the hereditary [[monarchy of Belgium]]]]\n\nIn 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first European monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.<ref>SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronf\u00f6ljd'', p. 16.</ref> Other kingdoms (such as the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]]<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544 \"Overturning Centuries of Royal Rules\"] (2011-10-28). ''BBC.com''. Retrieved 2018-11-02.</ref> in 2011) have since followed suit. The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture (subject to the claims of existing heirs) on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32073399|title=New rules on royal succession come into effect|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn the absence of children, the next most senior member of the collateral line (for example, a younger sibling of the previous monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can mean that there are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture. This has often led, especially in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], to conflict between the principle of primogeniture and the principle of [[proximity of blood]].\n\nOther hereditary systems of succession included [[tanistry]], which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and [[Agnatic seniority]]. In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority). However, on June 21, 2017, King Salman of Saudi Arabi revolted against this style of monarchy and elected his son to inherit the throne.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chara|first=Jihan|date=2018-10-01|title=Saudi Arabia: A prince's revolution|journal=European View|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=227\u2013234|doi=10.1177/1781685818803525|issn=1781-6858|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Elective monarchies===\n{{unsourced section|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Pope Francis in March 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Francis]], Sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]]]\nIn an [[elective monarchy]], monarchs are [[Election|elected]] or appointed by somebody (an [[electoral college]]) for life or a defined period, but then reign like any other monarch. There is no popular vote involved in elective monarchies, as the elective body usually consists of a small number of eligible people. Historical examples of elective monarchy are the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. For example, [[Pepin the Short]] (father of [[Charlemagne]]) was elected [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]] by an assembly of Frankish leading men; nobleman [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] of Poland was an elected king, as was [[Frederick I of Denmark]]. [[Germanic peoples]] also had elective monarchies.\n\nSix forms of elective monarchies exist today. The [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (who rules as [[Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]) is [[Papal conclave|elected]] for life by the [[College of Cardinals]]. In the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], the [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Prince and Grand Master]] is elected for life tenure by the Council Complete of State from within its members. In [[Malaysia]], the federal king, called the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] or Paramount Ruler, is elected for a five-year term from among and by the hereditary rulers (mostly [[sultan]]s) of nine of the federation's constitutive [[States of Malaysia|states]], all on the [[Malay peninsula]]. The [[United Arab Emirates]] also chooses its federal leaders from among emirs of the federated states. Furthermore, [[Andorra]] has a unique constitutional arrangement as one of its heads of state is the President of the [[France|French Republic]] in the form of a [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]]. This is the only instance in the world where the monarch of a state is elected by the citizens of a different country. In New Zealand, the Maori King, head of the Kingitanga Movement, is elected by a council of Maori elders at the funeral of their predecessor, which is also where their coronation takes place. All of the Heads of the Maori King Movement have been descendants of the first Maori King, Potatau Te Wherowhero, who was elected and became King in June 1858. The current monarch is King [[T\u016bheitia Paki|Tuheitia Potatau Te Wherowhero VII]], who was elected and became King on 21 August 2006, the same day as the funeral of his mother, [[Te Atairangikaahu|Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu]], the first Maori Queen. As well as being King and head of the Kingitanga Movement, King Tuheitia is also ''ex officio'' the Paramount Chief of the Waikato-Tainui tribe.\n\nAppointment by the current monarch is another system, used in [[Jordan]]. It also was used in [[Imperial Russia]]; however, it was soon changed to semi-Salic because the instability of the appointment system resulted in [[History of Russia (1721\u201396)|an age of palace revolutions]]. In this system, the monarch chooses the successor, who is always his relative.\n\n{{see also|jure uxoris}}\n\n== Current monarchies ==\n{{Main article|List of current monarchs of sovereign states}}\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}\n{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}\n}}\n{|align=\"center\" style=\"background:transparent;\"\n| [[File:World Monarchies.svg|thumb|800px|<!--\n    -->{{legend|#AA0000|[[Absolute monarchy]]}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#D45500|Semi-constitutional monarchy}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#285F27|[[Constitutional monarchy]]}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#008000|[[Commonwealth realm]]s (constitutional monarchies in [[personal union]])}}<!--\n    -->{{legend|#ff00ff|[[List of monarchies#Subnational monarchies|Subnational monarchies]] (traditional)}}\n]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\n{{Basic Forms of government}}\nCurrently, there are 44 nations and a population of roughly half a billion people in the world with a monarch as head of state. They fall roughly into the following categories:\n=== Commonwealth realms ===\n[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is, separately, monarch of sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s ([[Antigua and Barbuda]], the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], the [[The Bahamas|Commonwealth of the Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Canada]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Papua New Guinea|Independent State of Papua New Guinea]], the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]] and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]). They evolved out of the [[British Empire]] into fully independent states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that retain the Queen as head of state. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies where the Queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role. The Queen is head of the established [[Church of England]] in the United Kingdom, while the other 15 realms do not have an established church.\n=== Other European constitutional monarchies ===\nThe [[Principality of Andorra]], the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Norway]], the [[Kingdom of Spain]], and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role. In some cases, there is a Christian religion established as the official church in each of these countries. This is the Lutheran form of [[Protestantism]] in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, while Andorra is a [[Roman Catholic]] country. Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have no official state religion. Luxembourg, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, has five so-called ''officially recognised cults of national importance'' (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Greek Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Islam), a status which gives to those religions some privileges like the payment of a state salary to their priests.\n\nAndorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is a [[diarchy]], with the co-princeship being shared by the [[president of France]] and the [[bishop of Urgell]]. This situation, based on historical precedence, has created a peculiar situation among monarchies, as:\n*neither of the co-princes is of Andorran descent;\n* one is elected by citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French presidential elections; and\n*the other, the bishop of Urgel, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the pope.\n\n===European monarchies in which the monarch retains more powers===\nThe [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]] and the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] are constitutional monarchies in which the prince retains substantial powers. For example, the [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|2003 Constitution referendum]] gave the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] the power to veto any law that the [[Landtag]] (parliament) proposes, while the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The prince can appoint or dismiss any elective member or government employee. However, he is not an absolute monarch, as the people can call for a referendum to end the monarch's reign. When Hereditary Prince Alois threatened to veto a referendum to legalize abortion in 2011, it came as a surprise because the prince had not vetoed any law for over 30 years.{{NoteTag |In the end, this referendum failed to make it to a vote.}} The [[prince of Monaco]] has simpler powers; he cannot appoint or dismiss any elective member or government employee to or from his or her post, but he can elect the [[Minister of State of Monaco|minister of state]], [[Politics of Monaco|government council]] and judges. Both [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]], and [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein]], are theoretically very powerful within their small states, but they have very limited power compared to the Islamic monarchs (see below). They also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.\n\n===Islamic monarchies===\nThe Islamic monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]], the [[Nation of Brunei]], [[The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the [[State of Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Kingdom of Morocco]], the [[Sultanate of Oman]], the [[State of Qatar]], the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts. Brunei, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia remain absolute monarchies; Bahrain, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers; Jordan, Malaysia, and Morocco are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than European equivalents.\n\n===East and Southeast Asian constitutional monarchies===\nThe [[Kingdom of Bhutan]], the [[Kingdom of Cambodia]], the [[Kingdom of Thailand]] and [[Japan]] are constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or merely ceremonial role. Japan changed from traditional absolute monarchy into a constitutional one during the 20th century, and Bhutan made the change in 2008. Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from the [[French Colonial Empire]], but it was deposed after the [[Khmer Rouge]] came into power. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993. Thailand transitioned into a constitutional monarchy over the course of the 20th Century.\n\n===Other monarchies===\nFive monarchies do not fit into any of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] in [[Polynesia]]; the [[Kingdom of Eswatini]] and the [[Kingdom of Lesotho]] in Africa; the [[Vatican City State]] in Europe and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. Of these, Lesotho and Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while Eswatini and the Vatican City are absolute monarchies. Eswatini is unique among these monarchies, often being considered a [[diarchy]]: the King, or [[Ngwenyama]], rules alongside his mother, the [[Ndlovukati]], as dual heads of state (this was originally intended to provide a check on political power). The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which more or less has become symbolic in recent years. The [[Pope]] is the absolute monarch of the Vatican City State (a separate entity from the [[Holy See]]) by virtue of his position as head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Bishop of Rome; he is an elected rather than a hereditary ruler and does not have to be a citizen of the territory prior to his election by the cardinals. The Order of Malta describes itself as a \"sovereign subject\" based on its unique history and unusual present circumstances, but its exact status in international law is subject of debate. [[Samoa]], the position is described in Part III of the 1960 Samoan constitution. At the time the constitution was adopted, it was anticipated that future heads of state would be chosen from among the four Tama a 'Aiga \"royal\" paramount chiefs. However, this is not required by the constitution, so, for this reason, Samoa can be considered a republic rather than a [[constitutional monarchy]]. \n\nThe [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|ruling Kim family]] in [[North Korea]] ([[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and [[Kim Jong-un]]) has been described as a ''de facto'' [[absolute monarchy]]<ref>Young W.
