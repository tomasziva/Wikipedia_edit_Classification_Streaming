Mildew Wolf, the most popular character on the program, resurfaced six years after the cancellation of ''Cattanooga Cats'' as co-host (with [[Snagglepuss]]) on ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'', this time voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]. Lambsy appeared in the television film ''[[Yogi's Ark Lark]]''. [[Sky One]] occasionally broadcast ''Cattanooga Cats'' shorts in the UK in 1990, the segments were shown in complete isolation, broadcast neither as part of the original show or a new compilation.\n\nReruns of the show were not seen until the program began airing as part of the ''[[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]'' programming block on [[Cartoon Network]], which later became a spin-off network of its own. For several months, [[Boomerang (British and Irish TV channel)|Boomerang UK]] channel ran the musical interludes from the show, all of which ran to exactly 1 minute 45 seconds, as short (and unidentified) fillers before closing down at midnight. When the channel expanded to 24 hours, these interludes were dropped. The complete show has not been seen in the UK in recent years.\n\nMildew Wolf will appear in the upcoming [[HBO Max]] original series ''[[Jellystone!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/hbo-max-looney-tunes-jellystone-the-fungies-tig-n-seek-kids-family-series-1202771895/|title=HBO Max Sets New Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Robert Zemeckis Hybrid Series \u2018Tooned Out\u2019, More For Kids & Family Slate|first1=Patrick|last1=Hipes|first2=Patrick|last2=Hipes|date=October 29, 2019|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n[[Warner Archive Collection|Warner Archive]] has yet to release the entire complete series to DVD.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Cattanooga Cats\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1969\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack, [[Bubblegum pop]]\n| length     =\n| label      = Forward Records\n| producer   = [[Mike Curb]], [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]]\n}}\n\nA soundtrack album for the series was released in 1969, containing eleven of the show's songs with the lead vocals performed by [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]] and Peggy Clinger.

The trio are in competition for both the record and a [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,000,000 prize against the sinister '''Crumden''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]), who supposedly was the butler of the original Phineas. Crumden is aided by his idiotic chauffeur '''Bumbler''' (voiced by [[Allan Melvin]]) and his pet monkey '''Smirky''' (voiced by [[Don Messick]]). Unlike the other segments, ''Around the World in 79 Days'' was a serial with a continuing story, however, as with many shows made during this period, it has no specific ending.\n\n====Episodes====\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n! style=\"background:#99FF99; width:20px\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#99FF99;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#99FF99; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title= The Race is On\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|9|6}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title= Swiss Mis-Adventure\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|9|13}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title= Arabian Daze\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|9|20}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=4\n |Title= Madrid or Busted\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|9|27}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=5\n |Title= Mr. Bom Bom\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|10|4}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=6\n |Title= India or Bust\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|10|11}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=7\n |Title= Snow Slappy\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|10|18}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=8\n |Title= Finney Finney Fun Fun\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|10|25}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=9\n |Title= The Argentiney Meany\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|11|1}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=10\n |Title= The Tree Man\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|11|8}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=11\n |Title= Saucy Aussie\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|11|15}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=12\n |Title= Crumden's Last Stand\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|11|22}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=13\n |Title= Egyptian Jinx\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|11|29}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=14\n |Title= Border Disorder\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|12|6}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=15\n |Title= Troubles in Dutch\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|12|13}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=16\n |Title= The Fiji Weegees\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|12|20}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=17\n |Title= Hawaiian Hangup\n |OriginalAirDate={{start date|1969|12|27}}\n |ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=99FF99\n}}\n|}\n\n===''It's the Wolf!''===\n''It's the Wolf!'' followed the comic exploits of '''[[Mildew Wolf]]''' (voiced by [[Paul Lynde]]), who aspires to catch and eat a sure-footed [[Sheep|lamb]] named '''Lambsy''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]), but is always thwarted by the sheep dog '''Bristle Hound''' (voiced by [[Allan Melvin]]).<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/mildew.htm \"It's the Wolf\"] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Mildew Wolf, the most popular character on the program, resurfaced six years after the cancellation of ''Cattanooga Cats'' as co-host (with [[Snagglepuss]]) on ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'', this time voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]. Lambsy appeared in the television film ''[[Yogi's Ark Lark]]''. [[Sky One]] occasionally broadcast ''Cattanooga Cats'' shorts in the UK in 1990, the segments were shown in complete isolation, broadcast neither as part of the original show or a new compilation.\n\nReruns of the show were not seen until the program began airing as part of the ''[[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]'' programming block on [[Cartoon Network]], which later became a spin-off network of its own. For several months, [[Boomerang (British and Irish TV channel)|Boomerang UK]] channel ran the musical interludes from the show, all of which ran to exactly 1 minute 45 seconds, as short (and unidentified) fillers before closing down at midnight. When the channel expanded to 24 hours, these interludes were dropped. The complete show has not been seen in the UK in recent years.\n\nMildew Wolf will appear in the upcoming [[HBO Max]] original series ''[[Jellystone!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/hbo-max-looney-tunes-jellystone-the-fungies-tig-n-seek-kids-family-series-1202771895/|title=HBO Max Sets New Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Robert Zemeckis Hybrid Series \u2018Tooned Out\u2019, More For Kids & Family Slate|first1=Patrick|last1=Hipes|first2=Patrick|last2=Hipes|date=October 29, 2019|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n[[Warner Archive Collection|Warner Archive]] has yet to release the entire complete series to DVD.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Cattanooga Cats\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1969\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack, [[Bubblegum pop]]\n| length     =\n| label      = Forward Records\n| producer   = [[Mike Curb]], [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]]\n}}\n\nA soundtrack album for the series was released in 1969, containing eleven of the show's songs with the lead vocals performed by [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]] and Peggy Clinger. The songs \"Mother May I\" and \"Merry-Go-Round\" were also released as singles to coincide with the series and album, with \"Johnny Johnny Jump-Up\" and \"Country Carnival\" as their respective b-sides. The songwriters were uncredited on the album but were credited on the accompanying singles. [[Curb Records]], the eventual successor to Forward Records (owned by noted record producer [[Mike Curb]]), most likely owns the master tapes of the ''Cattanooga Cats'' album.
