He went through one year of [[chemotherapy]] treatments, followed by [[Radiation therapy|radiation]]. The treatments drained him physically and emotionally. He turned to music and writing for solace. For the next two years, Jonathan Emile employed his philosophy of Mindpeacelove creating music, in the hospital and between his treatments.
