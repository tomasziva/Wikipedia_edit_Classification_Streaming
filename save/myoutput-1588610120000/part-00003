The [[sentence (law)|sentence]] ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a '''death sentence''', whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an '''execution'''. A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as '''condemned''', and is said to be on [[death row]]. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as '''capital crimes''', '''capital offences''' or '''capital felonies''', and vary depending on the jurisdiction, but commonly include serious offences such as [[murder]], [[mass murder]], aggravated cases of [[rape]], [[child rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[terrorism]], [[treason]], [[espionage]], [[sedition]], offences against the State, such as attempting to overthrow government, [[piracy]], [[aircraft hijacking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[drug dealing]], and [[drug possession]], [[war crime]]s, [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]], and in some cases, the most serious acts of [[recidivism]], [[aggravated robbery]], and [[kidnapping]].\n\nEtymologically, the term ''capital'' (lit. \"of the head\", derived via the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|capitalis}}'' from ''{{lang|la|caput}}'', \"head\") in this context alluded to execution by [[Decapitation|beheading]].<ref name=\"KronenwetterP202\">{{Harvnb|Kronenwetter|2001|p=202}}</ref>\n\nFifty-six countries retain capital punishment, 106 countries have completely abolished it ''[[de jure]]'' for all crimes, eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes (while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 28 are abolitionist in practice.<ref name=\"Amnesty2018\">{{cite web |title=Abolitionist and Retentionist Countries as of July 2018 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT5066652017ENGLISH.pdf |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nCapital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, and positions can vary within a single [[political ideology]] or cultural region.

Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishments for wrongdoing generally included [[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]] compensation by the wrongdoer, [[corporal punishment]], [[shunning]], [[exile|banishment]] and execution. In tribal societies, compensation and shunning were often considered enough as a form of justice.<ref>So common was the practice of compensation that the word ''murder'' is derived from the French word ''mordre'' (bite) a reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death. The \"bite\" one had to pay was used as a term for the crime itself: \"Mordre wol out; that se we day by day.\" \u2013 [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1340\u20131400), [[The Canterbury Tales]], ''The Nun's Priest's Tale'', l. 4242 (1387\u20131400), repr.

This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. \"Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished.\"<ref>Translated from Waldmann, ''op.cit.'', p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn most countries that practise capital punishment, it is now reserved for [[murder]], [[terrorism]], [[war crimes]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of military justice.  In some countries [[sexual crime]]s, such as [[rape]], [[fornication]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], [[sodomy]], and [[bestiality]] carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[Hudud]], [[Zina]], and [[Qisas]] crimes, such as [[Apostasy from Islam|apostasy]] (formal renunciation of the [[state religion]]), [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]], [[moharebeh]], [[hirabah]], [[Fasad]], [[Mofsed-e-filarz]] and [[witchcraft]]. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|countries that use the death penalty]], [[drug trafficking]] and often [[drug possession]] is also a capital offence. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[financial crime]]s are punished by the death penalty.

[[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colosseum]].]]\nElaborations of tribal arbitration of [[feud]]s included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of ''substitution'' which might include material (for example, cattle, slaves, land) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the social system was based on tribes and clans, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the [[Norsemen]] ''[[Thing (assembly)|things]]''.<ref>Lindow, ''op.cit.'' (primarily discusses Icelandic ''things'').</ref> Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, [[trial by combat]] or blood money). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the [[duel]].\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_187.png|thumbnail|[[Beheading of John the Baptist]], woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], 1860]]\nIn certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slaves emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different \"[[social class]]es\" rather than \"tribes\". The earliest and most famous example is [[Code of Hammurabi]] which set the different punishment and compensation, according to the different class/group of victims and perpetrators. The [[Torah]] (Jewish Law), also known as the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Christian [[Old Testament]]), lays down the death penalty for murder, [[kidnapping]], practicing [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[blasphemy]], and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were rare.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William|last=Schabas|year=2002|title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81491-1}}</ref>\n\nA further example comes from [[Ancient Greece]], where the [[Athenian]] legal system replacing [[customary law|customary]] [[oral law]] was first written down by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though [[Solon]] later repealed Draco's code and published new laws, retaining capital punishment only for intentional [[homicide]], and only with victim's family permission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert|url=http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|title=Greece, A History of Ancient Greece, Draco and Solon Laws|publisher=History-world.org|accessdate=23 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021023919/http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|archivedate=21 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The word [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] derives from Draco's laws.

When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment. However, the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref>Benn, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.<ref name=\"benn 8\"/>\n\n[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Ling Chi \u2013 execution by [[slow slicing]] \u2013 was a form of torture and execution used in China from roughly AD 900 ([[Tang dynasty|Tang]] era) until it was banned in 1905.]]\nThe two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one's parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery, and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Despite the great discomfort involved, most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to one's ancestors to die without returning one's body to the grave intact.\n\nSome further forms of capital punishment were practised in the Tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal.{{Clarify|if they were extra-legal, they fail the definition of CapPun|date=July 2016}} The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod{{Clarify|what is scourging with a thick rod? Anal?|date=July 2016}} which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death.<ref name=Benn210>Benn, p. 210</ref> A further form of execution called Ling Chi ([[slow slicing]]), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used from the close of the Tang dynasty (around 900) to its abolition in 1905.\n\nWhen a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.\n\nNearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.<ref name=Benn210 />\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Rohrbach-verbrennung-1525.jpg|thumb|upright|The burning of Jakob Rohrbach, a leader of the peasants during the [[German Peasants' War]].]]\n[[File:Lamanie kolem L 001xx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[breaking wheel]] was used during the Middle Ages and was still in use into the 19th century.]]\n\nIn [[Middle Age|medieval]] and early modern Europe, before the development of modern [[prison]] systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment for even minor offences. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]], as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|title=History of the Death Penalty|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=12 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113123001/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn early modern Europe, a massive [[moral panic]] regarding [[witchcraft]] swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America. During this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. As a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the [[witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries).\n\nThe death penalty also targeted sexual offences such as [[sodomy]]. In England, the [[Buggery Act 1533]] stipulated hanging as punishment for \"[[buggery]]\". [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in 1835.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Gay History of Britain: Love and Sex Between Men Since the Middle Ages | publisher=[[Greenwood World Publishing]] | last1=Cook |first1=Matt | last2=Mills |first2=Robert | last3=Trumback |first3=Randolph | last4=Cocks |first4=Harry | year=2007 |page=109| isbn=978-1846450020}}</ref>\n\nDespite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century [[Jewish]] legal scholar, Moses [[Maimonides]], wrote, \"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death.\" He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], until we would be convicting merely \"according to the judge's caprice\".

The period saw an increase in standing police forces and permanent penitential institutions.

Official recognition of this phenomenon led to executions being carried out inside prisons, away from public view.\n\nIn England in the 18th century, when there was no police force, Parliament drastically increased the number of capital offences to more than 200.

According to [[Robert Conquest]], the leading expert on [[Joseph Stalin#Famine and the Great Terror: 1932\u20131939|Joseph Stalin's purges]], more than one million [[Soviet Union#Stalin era|Soviet citizens were executed]] during [[the Great Terror]] of 1937\u201338, almost all by a bullet to the back of the head.<ref>Conquest, Robert, ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment'', New York, pp. 485\u201386</ref> [[Mao Zedong]] publicly stated that \"800,000\" people had been executed in China during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976). Partly as a response to such excesses, civil rights organizations started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of [[human rights]] and an abolition of the death penalty.\n\n===Contemporary era===\n\nAmong countries around the world, all European (except [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]]) and many [[Oceania]]n states (including [[Capital punishment in Australia|Australia]] and [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|New Zealand]]), and [[Capital punishment in Canada|Canada]] have abolished capital punishment. In [[Latin America]], most states have completely abolished the use of capital punishment, while some countries such as [[Capital punishment in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Capital punishment in Guatemala|Guatemala]] allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason committed during wartime. The [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] (the federal government and 29 of the states), some [[Caribbean]] countries and the majority of countries in Asia (for example, [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]] and [[Capital punishment in India|India]]) retain capital punishment. In Africa, less than half of countries retain it, for example [[Capital punishment in Botswana|Botswana]] and [[Zambia]]. South Africa [[Capital punishment in South Africa|abolished the death penalty]] in 1995.\n\nAbolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades, the earliest being [[Michigan]] where it was abolished in 1846, while other states still actively use it today. The death penalty in the United States remains a contentious issue which is [[Capital punishment debate in the United States|hotly debated]].\n\nIn retentionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty. In abolitionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. One notable example is [[Capital punishment in Pakistan|Pakistan]] which in December 2014 lifted a six-year moratorium on executions after the [[2014 Peshawar school massacre|Peshawar school massacre]] during which 132 students and 9 members of staff of the Army Public School and Degree College Peshawar were killed by [[Taliban]] terrorists. Since then, Pakistan has executed over 400 convicts.<ref>{{cite web |title= 465 prisoners sent to gallows since 2014, says report |url= https://tribune.com.pk/story/1451615/465-prisoners-sent-gallows-since-2014-says-report/ |publisher= tribune.com.pk |accessdate= 19 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170706181850/https://tribune.com.pk/story/1451615/465-prisoners-sent-gallows-since-2014-says-report/ |archivedate= 6 July 2017 |df= dmy-all |date= 2017-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 two major countries, [[Capital punishment in Turkey|Turkey]] and the [[Capital punishment in the Philippines|Philippines]], saw their executives making moves to reinstate the death penalty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2017/03/19/514877/turkey-erdogan-referendum-death-penalty|title=PressTV-Erdogan vows to reinstate death penalty|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412143142/http://presstv.com/Detail/2017/03/19/514877/turkey-erdogan-referendum-death-penalty|archivedate=12 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"dpnythouse\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/asia/philippines-death-penalty.html|title=Philippines Moves Closer to Reinstating Death Penalty|first=Felipe|last=Villamor|date=1 March 2017|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302103805/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/asia/philippines-death-penalty.html|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>  {{as of|2017|3<!-- per the date of the cited supporting source -->}}, passage of the law in the Philippines awaits the Senate's approval.<ref name=\"dpnythouse\"/>\n\n==History of abolition==\n{{See also|Use of capital punishment by country#Abolition chronology}}\n[[File:Leopold II as Grand Duke of Tuscany by Joseph Hickel 1769.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold II]], Grand Duke of Tuscany, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Joseph Hickel|de}}, 1769]]\n[[File:Emperor Shomu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emperor Shomu]] banned the death penalty in Japan in [[724]].]]\nIn [[724]] in Japan, the death penalty is banned during the reign of [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]] but only lasts a few years.<ref name=Marazziti>{{cite book|author=Mario Marazziti|title=13 ways of looking at the death penalty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_5MBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|edition=|date=2015|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=978-1-60980-567-8|page=5}}</ref> In [[818]], [[Emperor Saga]] abolished the death penalty in 818 under the influence of Shinto and it lasted until 1156.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1472|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=kokugakuin.ac.jp|accessdate=5 September 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519153543/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1472|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In China, the death penalty was banned by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] in [[AD 747|747]], replacing it with [[exile]] or [[scourging]].

Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion.  More was himself executed for treason in 1535. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian [[Cesare Beccaria]] ''Dei Delitti e Delle Pene'' (\"[[On Crimes and Punishments]]\"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of [[social policy|social welfare]], of [[torture]] and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Leopold II]] of Habsburg, the future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the first permanent abolition in modern times.  On 30 November 1786, after having ''de facto'' blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the [[penal code]] that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating [[Cities for Life Day]]. In the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only [[treason]], [[piracy with violence]], [[arson in royal dockyards]] and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five-year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964.

The last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867. The last execution of the death penalty in Brazil was 1876, from there all the condemnations were commuted by the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] until its abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice (1938\u201353 and 1969\u201378), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered \"internal warfare\" and all sentence were commuted and were not carried out.\n\nAbolition occurred in [[Capital punishment in Canada#History|Canada in 1976 (except for some military offences, with complete abolition in 1998)]], in [[Capital punishment in France#Abolition|France in 1981]], and in [[Capital punishment in Australia#Commonwealth|Australia in 1973]] (although the state of [[Capital punishment in Australia#Western Australia|Western Australia]] retained the penalty until 1984).

The [[sentence (law)|sentence]] ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a '''death sentence''', whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an '''execution'''. A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as '''condemned''', and is said to be on [[death row]]. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as '''capital crimes''', '''capital offences''' or '''capital felonies''', and vary depending on the jurisdiction, but commonly include serious offences such as [[murder]], [[mass murder]], aggravated cases of [[rape]], [[child rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[terrorism]], [[treason]], [[espionage]], [[sedition]], offences against the State, such as attempting to overthrow government, [[piracy]], [[aircraft hijacking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[drug dealing]], and [[drug possession]], [[war crime]]s, [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]], and in some cases, the most serious acts of [[recidivism]], [[aggravated robbery]], and [[kidnapping]].\n\nEtymologically, the term ''capital'' (lit. \"of the head\", derived via the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|capitalis}}'' from ''{{lang|la|caput}}'', \"head\") in this context alluded to execution by [[Decapitation|beheading]].<ref name=\"KronenwetterP202\">{{Harvnb|Kronenwetter|2001|p=202}}</ref>\n\nFifty-six countries retain capital punishment, 106 countries have completely abolished it ''[[de jure]]'' for all crimes, eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes (while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 28 are abolitionist in practice.<ref name=\"Amnesty2018\">{{cite web |title=Abolitionist and Retentionist Countries as of July 2018 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT5066652017ENGLISH.pdf |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nCapital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, and positions can vary within a single [[political ideology]] or cultural region.

Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishments for wrongdoing generally included [[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]] compensation by the wrongdoer, [[corporal punishment]], [[shunning]], [[exile|banishment]] and execution. In tribal societies, compensation and shunning were often considered enough as a form of justice.<ref>So common was the practice of compensation that the word ''murder'' is derived from the French word ''mordre'' (bite) a reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death. The \"bite\" one had to pay was used as a term for the crime itself: \"Mordre wol out; that se we day by day.\" \u2013 [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1340\u20131400), [[The Canterbury Tales]], ''The Nun's Priest's Tale'', l. 4242 (1387\u20131400), repr. In ''The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'', ed. Alfred W. Pollard, et al. (1898).</ref> The response to crimes committed by neighbouring tribes, clans or communities included a formal apology, compensation, blood [[feud]]s, and [[tribal warfare]].\n\nA [[Feud|blood feud]] or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. \"Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished.\"<ref>Translated from Waldmann, ''op.cit.'', p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn most countries that practise capital punishment, it is now reserved for [[murder]], [[terrorism]], [[war crimes]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of military justice.  In some countries [[sexual crime]]s, such as [[rape]], [[fornication]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], [[sodomy]], and [[bestiality]] carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[Hudud]], [[Zina]], and [[Qisas]] crimes, such as [[Apostasy from Islam|apostasy]] (formal renunciation of the [[state religion]]), [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]], [[moharebeh]], [[hirabah]], [[Fasad]], [[Mofsed-e-filarz]] and [[witchcraft]]. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|countries that use the death penalty]], [[drug trafficking]] and often [[drug possession]] is also a capital offence. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[financial crime]]s are punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offences such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |accessdate=20 July 2006 |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703143147/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=3 July 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Ancient history===\n[[File:Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me - The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer - Walters 37113.jpg|thumb|left|''The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer'', by [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] (1883). [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colosseum]].]]\nElaborations of tribal arbitration of [[feud]]s included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of ''substitution'' which might include material (for example, cattle, slaves, land) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the social system was based on tribes and clans, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the [[Norsemen]] ''[[Thing (assembly)|things]]''.<ref>Lindow, ''op.cit.'' (primarily discusses Icelandic ''things'').</ref> Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, [[trial by combat]] or blood money). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the [[duel]].\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_187.png|thumbnail|[[Beheading of John the Baptist]], woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], 1860]]\nIn certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slaves emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different \"[[social class]]es\" rather than \"tribes\". The earliest and most famous example is [[Code of Hammurabi]] which set the different punishment and compensation, according to the different class/group of victims and perpetrators. The [[Torah]] (Jewish Law), also known as the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Christian [[Old Testament]]), lays down the death penalty for murder, [[kidnapping]], practicing [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[blasphemy]], and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were rare.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William|last=Schabas|year=2002|title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81491-1}}</ref>\n\nA further example comes from [[Ancient Greece]], where the [[Athenian]] legal system replacing [[customary law|customary]] [[oral law]] was first written down by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though [[Solon]] later repealed Draco's code and published new laws, retaining capital punishment only for intentional [[homicide]], and only with victim's family permission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert|url=http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|title=Greece, A History of Ancient Greece, Draco and Solon Laws|publisher=History-world.org|accessdate=23 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021023919/http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|archivedate=21 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The word [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] derives from Draco's laws.

When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment. However, the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref>Benn, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.<ref name=\"benn 8\"/>\n\n[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Ling Chi \u2013 execution by [[slow slicing]] \u2013 was a form of torture and execution used in China from roughly AD 900 ([[Tang dynasty|Tang]] era) until it was banned in 1905.]]\nThe two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one's parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery, and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Despite the great discomfort involved, most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to one's ancestors to die without returning one's body to the grave intact.\n\nSome further forms of capital punishment were practised in the Tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal.{{Clarify|if they were extra-legal, they fail the definition of CapPun|date=July 2016}} The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod{{Clarify|what is scourging with a thick rod? Anal?|date=July 2016}} which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death.<ref name=Benn210>Benn, p. 210</ref> A further form of execution called Ling Chi ([[slow slicing]]), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used from the close of the Tang dynasty (around 900) to its abolition in 1905.\n\nWhen a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.\n\nNearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.<ref name=Benn210 />\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Rohrbach-verbrennung-1525.jpg|thumb|upright|The burning of Jakob Rohrbach, a leader of the peasants during the [[German Peasants' War]].]]\n[[File:Lamanie kolem L 001xx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[breaking wheel]] was used during the Middle Ages and was still in use into the 19th century.]]\n\nIn [[Middle Age|medieval]] and early modern Europe, before the development of modern [[prison]] systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment for even minor offences. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]], as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|title=History of the Death Penalty|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=12 December 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113123001/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn early modern Europe, a massive [[moral panic]] regarding [[witchcraft]] swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America. During this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. As a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the [[witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries).\n\nThe death penalty also targeted sexual offences such as [[sodomy]]. In England, the [[Buggery Act 1533]] stipulated hanging as punishment for \"[[buggery]]\". [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in 1835.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Gay History of Britain: Love and Sex Between Men Since the Middle Ages | publisher=[[Greenwood World Publishing]] | last1=Cook |first1=Matt | last2=Mills |first2=Robert | last3=Trumback |first3=Randolph | last4=Cocks |first4=Harry | year=2007 |page=109| isbn=978-1846450020}}</ref>\n\nDespite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century [[Jewish]] legal scholar, Moses [[Maimonides]], wrote, \"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death.\" He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], until we would be convicting merely \"according to the judge's caprice\". Maimonides's concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.<ref name=\"Moses Maimonides 1967\">Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg.

The period saw an increase in standing police forces and permanent penitential institutions. [[Rational choice theory (criminology)|Rational choice theory]], a [[utilitarian]] approach to [[criminology]] which justifies punishment as a form of deterrence as opposed to retribution, can be traced back to [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]], whose influential treatise ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene|On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1764) was the first detailed analysis of capital punishment to demand the abolition of the death penalty.<ref>Marcello Maestro, \"A pioneer for the abolition of capital punishment: Cesare Beccaria.\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 34.3 (1973): 463-468.

Official recognition of this phenomenon led to executions being carried out inside prisons, away from public view.\n\nIn England in the 18th century, when there was no police force, Parliament drastically increased the number of capital offences to more than 200. These were mainly property offences, for example cutting down a cherry tree in an orchard.<ref name=\"JonesJohnstone2011\">{{cite book|author1=Mark Jones|author2=Peter Johnstone|title=History of Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhPdaCJWQikC&pg=PA152|date=22 July 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-4377-3491-1|pages=150\u2013}}</ref> In 1820, there were 160, including crimes such as shoplifting, petty theft or stealing cattle.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel, ''The Story of Civilization, Volume IX: The Age of Voltaire'' New York, 1965, p. 71</ref> The severity of the so-called [[Bloody Code]] was often tempered by juries who refused to convict, or judges, in the case of petty theft, who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime.<ref>Durant, p. 72,</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Mexican execution, 1914.jpg|left|thumb|Mexican execution by firing squad, 1916]]\n\nIn [[Nazi Germany#Law|Nazi Germany]] there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation and death by shooting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gN0QgcW4Td0C&pg=PA289|page= 289|title=The criminal law of Japan: the general part|author=Dando Shigemitsu|year=1999|isbn= 9780837706535}}</ref> Also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline. In the past, [[cowardice]], absence without leave, [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death (see [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]] and [[running the gauntlet]]). One method of execution, since firearms came into common use, has also been [[firing squad]], although some countries use execution with a single shot to the head or neck.\n[[File:German announcement General Government Poland 1944.jpg|thumb|50 Poles tried and sentenced to death by a ''[[drumhead court-martial|Standgericht]]'' in retaliation for the assassination of 1 German policeman in [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|Nazi-occupied Poland]], 1944]]\n[[File:Antanas Smetona 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[President of Lithuania|Lithuanian President]] [[Antanas Smetona]]'s regime was the first in Europe to sentence [[Nazis]] and [[Communists]] to death; both were seen as a threat to the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Independence]] of [[Lithuania]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Alfonsas |last=Eidintas |year=2015 | title=Antanas Smetona and His Lithuania: From the National Liberation Movement to an Authoritarian Regime (1893\u20131940) |translator=[[Alfred Erich Senn]] |publisher=Brill Rodopi |series=On the Boundary of Two Worlds |isbn=9789004302037 |page=301 |ref=harv}}</ref>]]\nVarious authoritarian states\u2014for example those with Fascist or Communist governments\u2014employed the death penalty as a potent means of [[political repression|political oppression]]. According to [[Robert Conquest]], the leading expert on [[Joseph Stalin#Famine and the Great Terror: 1932\u20131939|Joseph Stalin's purges]], more than one million [[Soviet Union#Stalin era|Soviet citizens were executed]] during [[the Great Terror]] of 1937\u201338, almost all by a bullet to the back of the head.<ref>Conquest, Robert, ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment'', New York, pp. 485\u201386</ref> [[Mao Zedong]] publicly stated that \"800,000\" people had been executed in China during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976). Partly as a response to such excesses, civil rights organizations started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of [[human rights]] and an abolition of the death penalty.\n\n===Contemporary era===\n\nAmong countries around the world, all European (except [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]]) and many [[Oceania]]n states (including [[Capital punishment in Australia|Australia]] and [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|New Zealand]]), and [[Capital punishment in Canada|Canada]] have abolished capital punishment. In [[Latin America]], most states have completely abolished the use of capital punishment, while some countries such as [[Capital punishment in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Capital punishment in Guatemala|Guatemala]] allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason committed during wartime. The [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] (the federal government and 29 of the states), some [[Caribbean]] countries and the majority of countries in Asia (for example, [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]] and [[Capital punishment in India|India]]) retain capital punishment. In Africa, less than half of countries retain it, for example [[Capital punishment in Botswana|Botswana]] and [[Zambia]]. South Africa [[Capital punishment in South Africa|abolished the death penalty]] in 1995.\n\nAbolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades, the earliest being [[Michigan]] where it was abolished in 1846, while other states still actively use it today. The death penalty in the United States remains a contentious issue which is [[Capital punishment debate in the United States|hotly debated]].\n\nIn retentionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty. In abolitionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. One notable example is [[Capital punishment in Pakistan|Pakistan]] which in December 2014 lifted a six-year moratorium on executions after the [[2014 Peshawar school massacre|Peshawar school massacre]] during which 132 students and 9 members of staff of the Army Public School and Degree College Peshawar were killed by [[Taliban]] terrorists.

Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion.  More was himself executed for treason in 1535. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian [[Cesare Beccaria]] ''Dei Delitti e Delle Pene'' (\"[[On Crimes and Punishments]]\"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of [[social policy|social welfare]], of [[torture]] and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Leopold II]] of Habsburg, the future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the first permanent abolition in modern times.  On 30 November 1786, after having ''de facto'' blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the [[penal code]] that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating [[Cities for Life Day]]. In the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only [[treason]], [[piracy with violence]], [[arson in royal dockyards]] and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five-year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964.

The last execution of the death penalty in Brazil was 1876, from there all the condemnations were commuted by the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] until its abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice (1938\u201353 and 1969\u201378), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered \"internal warfare\" and all sentence were commuted and were not carried out.\n\nAbolition occurred in [[Capital punishment in Canada#History|Canada in 1976 (except for some military offences, with complete abolition in 1998)]], in [[Capital punishment in France#Abolition|France in 1981]], and in [[Capital punishment in Australia#Commonwealth|Australia in 1973]] (although the state of [[Capital punishment in Australia#Western Australia|Western Australia]] retained the penalty until 1984).
