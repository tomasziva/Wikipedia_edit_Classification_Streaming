At the time of his birth, the area was known as [[French Sudan]] as part of colonial [[French West Africa]], which was formally established a few years before his birth. After his father's death, he was adopted by his mother's second husband, Tidjani Amadou Ali Thiam of the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] ethnic group. He first attended the [[Qur'an]]ic school run by Tierno Bokar, a dignitary of the [[Tijaniyyah]] brotherhood, then transferred to a French school at Bandiagara, then to one at [[Djenn\u00e9]]. In 1915, he ran away from school and rejoined his mother at [[Kati]], where he resumed his studies.\n\nIn 1921, he turned down entry into the ''\u00e9cole normale'' in [[Gor\u00e9e]]. As a punishment, the governor appointed him to [[Ouagadougou]] with the role he later described as that of \"an essentially precarious and revocable temporary writer\". From 1922 to 1932, he held several posts in the colonial administration in [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], now [[Burkina Faso]], and from 1932 to 1942 in [[Bamako]]. In 1933, he took six months' leave to visit [[Tierno Bokar]], his spiritual leader. (See also:[[Sufi studies]])\n\nIn 1942, he was appointed to the [[Institut Fran\u00e7ais d\u2019Afrique Noire]] (IFAN \u2014 the French Institute of Black Africa) in [[Dakar]], thanks to the benevolence of [[Th\u00e9odore Monod]], its director. At IFAN, he made [[ethnology|ethnological]] surveys and collected traditions. For 15 years he devoted himself to research, which would later lead to the publication of his work ''L'Empire peul de Macina'' (''The Fula Empire of Macina''). In 1951, he obtained a [[UNESCO]] grant, enabling him to travel to [[Paris]] and meet with intellectuals from Africanist circles, notably [[Marcel Griaule]].\n\nWith Mali's independence in 1960, B\u00e2 founded the Institute of Human Sciences in Bamako, and represented his country at the UNESCO general conferences. In 1962, he was elected to UNESCO's executive council, and in 1966 he helped establish a unified system for the transcription of African languages.\n\nHis term in the executive council ended in 1970, and he devoted the remaining years of his life to research and writing. In 1971, he moved to the [[Marcory]] suburb of [[Abidjan]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]],<ref>{{cite web | last =Hawkins | first =Peter | title =Amadou Hampat\u00e9 Ba | work =French Literature Companion | publisher =Answers.com | url =http://www.answers.com/topic/amadou-hampate-ba | accessdate =2 April 2009 }}</ref> and worked on classifying the archives of West African oral tradition that he had accumulated throughout his lifetime, as well as writing his memoirs (''Amkoullel l'enfant peul'' and ''Oui mon commandant!'', both published posthumously).
