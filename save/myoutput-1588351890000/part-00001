His career spanned from playing drums in his father's [[big band]] at the age of 13, through scoring films, to [[electronic music]] featuring tape manipulation of the sounds of birds, animals, insects and [[Autism|autistic]] children\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Richard Williams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |title=Obituary: Basil Kirchin |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Basil-1014x487.jpg|thumb|Basil Kirchin explaining a sound]]\n\n==Early life==\nBasil Kirchin was born Basil Philip Kirchinsky, son of Lilian Kay Kirchin (Walters) and the bandleader [[Ivor Kirchin]] (Isaac Kirchinsky) in [[Blackpool]], Lancashire England.  He debuted at age 13, playing drums with [[Ivor Kirchin|his father]]'s Big Band orchestra at the Paramount, [[Tottenham Court Road]] in London. This was all in the 1940's during World War II, and during the Blitz we would play for eight hours every day and make his bed in the Warren Street Underground station while bombs exploded above him during the Blitz. <ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3qTzSg8RZZmnRkwBXzJZVgN/the-quiet-genius-of-basil-kirchin The quiet genius of Basil Kirchin], BBC Radio, retrieved May 1, 2020</ref> After the war he left his father's band to play with the bands of [[Harry Roy]], Teddy Foster, Jack Nathan and [[Ted Heath (bandleader)|Ted Heath]], but he returned to work with his father again in 1951. The Kirchin Band's early recordings for Parlophone were produced by [[George Martin]]. The Kirchin Band travelled with their own PA, which meant Basil was able to record the band's live performances live off the soundboard.  By 1957, the rise of [[Skiffle]] and [[Rock and Roll]] had brought an end to the Big Band era and Kirchin decided it was time to move on \"because you're a prisoner of rhythm. And I was fed up playing other people's music\".<ref name=Stanley>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-journey-into-the-unheard-nnf7q7bfq0l|title=A journey into the unheard|publisher=[[The Times]]|date= 3 June 2003|author= Bob Stanley|page= 21}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\nKirchin traveled to India in search of spiritual fulfillment around 1957 and spent five months in the [[Ramakrishna Temple]] close to the Ganges river, years before it was popular for musicians to do so, and he set out to learn about the world and see if his unique perspective and curiosity for life and the world were \"more than just the ramblings of a pot-head\" <ref>Stephenson, Matt. \"[https://www.visithull.org/discover/basil-kirchin-man-behind-music/ BASIL KIRCHIN: THE MAN BEHIND THE MUSIC]\", visithull.org. retrieved May 1, 2020</ref>.   He then moved to Sydney in October 1959 with his wife Theresa but as his possessions were being unloaded from the ship a strap broke and everything, including his recordings of the Kirchin band, was lost beneath the sea.  This loss would trouble him for the rest of his life.<ref name=Stanley/>\n\nIn 1961, Kirchin returned to Britain. His father Ivor had secured a residency at the newly opened Mecca Locarno club in Hull, and Basil spent his time between London and Hull. In Hull he befriended local musician [[Fairview Studios|Keith Herd]] and began working on experimental pieces, \"soundtracks for unmade films\". In London he lived with songwriters Jimmy Jaques and Pat Ryan, and contributed heavily to the [[Johnny Keating]] album 'The Keating Sound'. He also produced material for the [[De Wolfe Music|De Wolfe]] library using the talents of young [[session musician]]s such as [[Big Jim Sullivan]], [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Tubby Hayes]]. In 1967, the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] awarded him a grant to purchase a [[Nagra]] tape recorder.  This he used to collect ambient sounds, animal noises at [[London Zoo]] and the voices of [[autistic]] children. The controversial recording of autistic children came about because of his wife who worked as a teacher at a special ed school in a little valley in Switzerland in the city of Shermat. This school was inhabited only by autistic children and their teachers and caregivers. He noticed from days when he picked his wife up from work that the children would communicate through musical phrases \"I was fascinated by the sounds they make when they tried to communicate\" \"the melodies that they sing, no normal, with the greatest respect, human mind, could think of such intervals as they pitch and sing and the flood it comes out with and its emotional.\" Kirchin experimented with slowing down the recordings to reveal \"Little boulders of sound\". \"It's gonna sound quite ridiculous but theres a certain corner in Zurich that when it rains and the rains come around this corner if you have the ability to do so you can slow it down to 834ths of a second its a whole symphony orchestra\" <ref>Mistry, Pritti, \"[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-38688135 Basil Kirchin: The Forgotten Genius of UK Music]\", BBC News, 15 Feb 2017</ref>  \"Take birdsong: all those harmonics you can't hear are brought down \u2013 sounds that human ears have never heard before\".<ref name=Stanley /> This he explained was the Worlds Within Worlds, and was apart of his quantum concept of time which he believed \"there are several universes going on at the same time,\" \"So, like a fly's world is completely different to our world, it moves at a completely different speed. And therefore if you speed up or slow down sound you can find a way into these parallel universes.\" <ref>Mistry, Pritti, \"[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-38688135 Basil Kirchin: The Forgotten Genius of UK Music]\", BBC News, 15 Feb 2017</ref> Through his imaginary film scores he was able to find work composing for horror and scifi films which helped to finance his experimentations with sounds were partly financed by composing film music for ''[[Catch Us If You Can (film)|Catch Us If You Can]]'' (1965), ''[[The Shuttered Room]]'' (1967), ''[[The Strange Affair]]'' (1968), ''[[I Start Counting]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971). The use of his music in films exposed him to audiences and his clipped up and distorted sounds did very well at complimenting the disturbing visual images within the horror and scifi genres. <ref>Williams, Richard, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/16/basil-kirchin-the-first-painter-of-music Basil Kirchin: the first painter of music]\" The Guardian. 16 Feb 2017</ref>\n\nHis experimental pieces were released on two albums both called ''World Within Worlds''.  The first was issued in 1971: ''Worlds Within Worlds'', [[Columbia Graphophone Company|EMI Columbia]] (SCX6463) and included Part I \u2013 Integration 2; Part II \u2013 The Human Element. The second was not issued until 1974:  ''Worlds Within Worlds'' [[Island Records]] (HELP 18) Part III \u2013 Emergence; Part IV \u2013 Evolution. Personnel included free improvising musicians such as [[Evan Parker]], [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]] and [[Kenny Wheeler]]. Liner notes for the second release included laudatory comments from [[Brian Eno]].  Neither record sold more than a handful of copies, and it was not until much later that their pioneering techniques were recognised.  Meanwhile, Kirchin became frustrated with the record companies meddling with his material, and went into seclusion. He continued to produce work in Hull, working with his friend Keith Herd and Hull-based musicians Dane Morrell, Danny Wood, Bernie Dolman and Roy Neave at [[Fairview Studios]] in Willerby, Hull.\n\nKirchin continued to compose throughout his life, and thirty years after their initial releases his music became acknowledged by a new generation with the release of material by [[Trunk Records]].  Kirchin said \"I wanted to try and leave something for young people who are starting in music and looking for something as I've been looking all my life\".\n\nHe spent the later years of his life living back in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in a modest terraced house with his beloved Swiss wife, Esther (n\u00e9e Muller) \u2013 his early fame and eventful life not known in the ex-fishing community of Hessle Road where he lived until his death in June 2005.<ref>Obituary [[The Independent]] 2 July 2005; Pierre Perrone; p. 38</ref> Esther died in July 2007.

Brian Eno states \"Basil realised long before the rest of us did that sound could become a malleable material,\" \"He was like a painter. That idea of music as painting was something that became very important to me.\" \"When we [Eno and David Byrne] made My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, with the idea of using found voices as the centre of the piece rather than having them as an ornament, I\u2019m sure the boldness and confidence I had for that partly came from Basil.\u201d <ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/16/basil-kirchin-the-first-painter-of-music Basil Kirchin The First Painter of Music], The Guardian.
