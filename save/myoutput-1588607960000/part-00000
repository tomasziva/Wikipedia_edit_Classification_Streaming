During the [[communist]] regime of [[Josip Broz Tito]], Pu\u010dnik was one of the most outspoken Slovenian critics of dictatorship and lack of civil liberties in [[Yugoslavia]]. He was imprisoned for a total of seven years, and later forced into exile. After returning to Slovenia in the late 1980s, he became the leader of the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], a platform of democratic parties that defeated the communists in the first free elections in 1990 and introduced a democratic system and market economy to Slovenia. He is also considered one of the fathers of Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia.<ref>[http://pogovori.drugisvet.com/2010/12/rosvita-pesek-pucnik-je-bil-motor-slovenskega-osamosvajanja/ Rosvita Pesek: Pu\u010dnik je bil motor slovenskega osamosvajanja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225110/http://pogovori.drugisvet.com/2010/12/rosvita-pesek-pucnik-je-bil-motor-slovenskega-osamosvajanja/ |date=2011-07-25 }}, Pogvori drugisvet.com</ref>\n\n== Early life and formation ==\nPu\u010dnik was born in the village of [[\u010cre\u0161njevec, Slovenska Bistrica|\u010cre\u0161njevec]] in [[Slovenian Styria]] (now part of the municipality of [[Slovenska Bistrica]]), in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. He came from a [[Roman Catholic]] peasant background. His family had supported the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]] during [[World War II]]: his older brother Ivan was an anti-Nazi resistance fighter in the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] movement.\n\nAlready as a teenager, Pu\u010dnik clashed with the [[communist]] establishment. Because of some critical thoughts published in the high school paper ''Iskanja'' (Quests) he was prohibited from taking his final exam.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200303/clanek/pucniknekrolog/ Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik (1932-2003)], Mladina.si <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since he couldn't enroll in the University, he was drafted in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]. After completing the military service, he took the final exam, passed it and enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[comparative literature]], graduating in 1958. \n\nWhile living in [[Ljubljana]], he became involved with a group of young intellectuals, known as the [[Critical generation]], which tried to open a space for public debate and challenged the rigid cultural policies of the [[Titoist]] regime in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]]. Among Pu\u010dnik's closest collaborators from that period were the literary historian [[Taras Kermauner]], sociologist [[Veljko Rus]], and poet [[Veno Taufer]]. Pu\u010dnik believed that the system could be changed from inside and therefore joined the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]]. At the same time, he published several articles in the journal ''[[Revija 57]]'', in which he openly criticised the economic policies of the [[communist regime]].\n\n== The dissident years ==\n\nIn 1958, Pu\u010dnik was arrested accused of \"subversion of the socialist system\" and sentenced to 9 years in jail. At the trial, which lasted only a couple of hours, he was accused of having instigated workers to strike. Some have suggested that Pu\u010dnik's imprisonment was a deliberate attempt by the regime to silence dissident intellectuals.<ref>[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ Interview with Taras Kermauner on the Sloevnian National TV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030937/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ |date=2008-04-11 }}</ref> He was released in 1963 and immediately continued writing for the alternative journal ''[[Perspektive]]''. At this point he was already publicly stating his disapproval of the regime.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1964, his article ''Problemi na\u0161ega kmetijstva'' (The Problems of Our Agriculture) was published in the journal ''[[Perspektive]]''. In it, Pu\u010dnik criticized the agricultural policy of the regime, arguing that it was inefficient using publicly available official data. He was arrested again, sentenced to another two years in prison and expelled from the Communist Party. \n\nDuring his time in prison, Pu\u010dnik became an idol for his generation.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ Odprti kop - Intervju: Dr. Taras Kermauner<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030937/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ |date=2008-04-11 }}</ref> The playwright [[Dominik Smole]] dedicated the play ''[[Antigone (Dominik Smole)|Antigone]]'' to him and [[Primo\u017e Kozak]] portrayed him in the leading role of his play ''Afera'' (The Scandal). Both plays were metaphors for the totalitarian repression in communist Yugoslavia.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n== Exile and academic career ==\n\nPu\u010dnik was released from jail in 1966. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a job, he decided to emigrate to [[Germany]]. He settled in [[Hamburg]], making a living from manual jobs. When he decided to enrol as a postgraduate student at the [[University of Hamburg]], the University of Ljubljana refused to provide him with a copy of his degree.<ref>[http://www.ijpucnik.si/joze_pucnik In\u0161titut Jo\u017eeta Pu\u010dnika => joze pucnik<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316065721/http://www.ijpucnik.si/joze_pucnik |date=2008-03-16 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 /> He thus enrolled again to [[undergraduate]] study of [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], obtaining his [[PhD]] in 1971. He worked at the universities of Hamburg and [[L\u00fcneburg]], where he taught sociology. During his life in Germany, Pu\u010dnik became a supporter of the [[German Social Democratic Party]], maintaining close relations with several of its leaders. In the late 1980s, he became an open admirer of the Social Democratic leader of [[Lower Saxony]] [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]], later [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor of Germany]], whom he took as his main role model for his subsequent political activity.<ref>Taras Kermauner, Skupinski portret z Du\u0161anom Pirjevcem. Ljubljana: Znanstveno in raziskovalno sredi\u0161\u010de, 2002. P. 139</ref>\n\nIn the academic sphere, he became influenced by the theories of [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his [[system theory]], as well as by several phenomenological sociologists such as [[Alfred Schutz]] and the [[Slovenes|Slovene]]-born [[Thomas Luckmann]].<ref>http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&id=F681B62B-37ED-4910-8E7B-93F5B140CCE7</ref> \n\nDuring his years of exile, he kept up a correspondence with several important critical intellectuals in Slovenia, especially [[Ivo Urban\u010di\u010d]].\n\n== Return to Slovenia ==\n\nIn the 1980s, Pu\u010dnik could again publish articles in Slovenia, this time in the alternative journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. In 1987, he co-authored the [[Contributions to the Slovenian National Program]], published in the 57th issue of the Nova revija journal. The text was written as the response to the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] of 1986, and set the grounds for a political opposition to the communist regime. It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. Pu\u010dnik's article was centred on issues of democratization and political plurality, and openly stressed the need for Slovenia's full sovereignty in order to secure such development.\n\nHe returned to Slovenia in 1989 at the invitation of the newly formed opposition [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Union of Slovenia]]. He was elected president of the party in 1989 and the following year he was chosen as the leader of the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], a common platform of all democratic opposition parties in Slovenia. The coalition won the first democratic elections in 1990. Pu\u010dnik ran for [[President of Slovenia]] but lost to [[Milan Ku\u010dan]], the last secretary general of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]]. He was nevertheless elected to the [[Slovenian Parliament]] and remained the official leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, and the coalition's parliamentary leader. \n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, he was among those who led [[Slovenia]] to independence from [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1992, after the fall of [[Lojze Peterle]]'s coalition government, Pu\u010dnik decided to lead his party into a coalition with the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]] and briefly served as vice-president in the first government of [[Janez Drnov\u0161ek]].\n\nIn the elections of 1992, the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] suffered a complete defeat, gaining a mere 3.4% of the vote, barely securing the entry into the Parliament. Pu\u010dnik resigned as president of the party in favour of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]. Between 1992 and 1996, Pu\u010dnik served as a member of the [[National Assembly of Slovenia]]. During this time, he led a parliamentary commission to clarify political responsibility for the summary executions perpetrated by the communist regime in Slovenia after [[World War II]] .\n\nAfter 1996, he retired from active politics, but remained honorary president of the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] and continued to voice his opinion on matters of public interest. He remained utterly critical of the policies of [[Prime Minister of Slovenia|Prime Minister]] [[Janez Drnov\u0161ek]] and President [[Milan Ku\u010dan]]. He also criticized the political transition to democracy in general, especially the insufficient implementation of the rule of law, the widespread corruption and the maintenance of the power networks from the previous regime.\n\nHe died in Germany in 2003 and was buried in his home village of \u010cre\u0161njevec. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd. The eulogy was delivered by philosopher and his lifelong friend [[Ivo Urban\u010di\u010d]].\n\n== Legacy ==\nPu\u010dnik is considered to be one of the fathers of independent Slovenia.<ref>[http://druzina.si/icd/spletnastran.nsf/all/ccd4e15db3744c51c12573c600365d07?OpenDocument&Click= V \u010dast domovini: Stati inu obstati], 6 January 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskenovice.si/clanek/o144141 |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910093754/http://www.slovenskenovice.si/clanek/o144141 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/sest-let-od-smrti-jozeta-pucnika/96000 Posmrtno odlikovanje za Jo\u017eeta Pu\u010dnika Pu\u010dnikovega odlikovanja ni prevzel nih\u010de Objavljeno], 22 June 2006</ref> Some, especially in the Slovenian right wing circles, have also called him \"Father of Slovenian Democracy\".<ref>[http://www.prebold.sds.si/news/27114 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317061343/http://www.prebold.sds.si/news/27114 |date=March 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, he was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Distinct Merits of Slovenia]].

He is also considered one of the fathers of Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia.<ref>[http://pogovori.drugisvet.com/2010/12/rosvita-pesek-pucnik-je-bil-motor-slovenskega-osamosvajanja/ Rosvita Pesek: Pu\u010dnik je bil motor slovenskega osamosvajanja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225110/http://pogovori.drugisvet.com/2010/12/rosvita-pesek-pucnik-je-bil-motor-slovenskega-osamosvajanja/ |date=2011-07-25 }}, Pogvori drugisvet.com</ref>\n\n== Early life and formation ==\nPu\u010dnik was born in the village of [[\u010cre\u0161njevec, Slovenska Bistrica|\u010cre\u0161njevec]] in [[Slovenian Styria]] (now part of the municipality of [[Slovenska Bistrica]]), in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. He came from a [[Roman Catholic]] peasant background. His family had supported the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]] during [[World War II]]: his older brother Ivan was an anti-Nazi resistance fighter in the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] movement.\n\nAlready as a teenager, Pu\u010dnik clashed with the [[communist]] establishment. Because of some critical thoughts published in the high school paper ''Iskanja'' (Quests) he was prohibited from taking his final exam.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200303/clanek/pucniknekrolog/ Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik (1932-2003)], Mladina.si <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since he couldn't enroll in the University, he was drafted in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]. After completing the military service, he took the final exam, passed it and enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[comparative literature]], graduating in 1958. \n\nWhile living in [[Ljubljana]], he became involved with a group of young intellectuals, known as the [[Critical generation]], which tried to open a space for public debate and challenged the rigid cultural policies of the [[Titoist]] regime in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]]. Among Pu\u010dnik's closest collaborators from that period were the literary historian [[Taras Kermauner]], sociologist [[Veljko Rus]], and poet [[Veno Taufer]]. Pu\u010dnik believed that the system could be changed from inside and therefore joined the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]]. At the same time, he published several articles in the journal ''[[Revija 57]]'', in which he openly criticised the economic policies of the [[communist regime]].\n\n== The dissident years ==\n\nIn 1958, Pu\u010dnik was arrested accused of \"subversion of the socialist system\" and sentenced to 9 years in jail. At the trial, which lasted only a couple of hours, he was accused of having instigated workers to strike. Some have suggested that Pu\u010dnik's imprisonment was a deliberate attempt by the regime to silence dissident intellectuals.<ref>[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ Interview with Taras Kermauner on the Sloevnian National TV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030937/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ |date=2008-04-11 }}</ref> He was released in 1963 and immediately continued writing for the alternative journal ''[[Perspektive]]''. At this point he was already publicly stating his disapproval of the regime.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1964, his article ''Problemi na\u0161ega kmetijstva'' (The Problems of Our Agriculture) was published in the journal ''[[Perspektive]]''. In it, Pu\u010dnik criticized the agricultural policy of the regime, arguing that it was inefficient using publicly available official data. He was arrested again, sentenced to another two years in prison and expelled from the Communist Party. \n\nDuring his time in prison, Pu\u010dnik became an idol for his generation.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ Odprti kop - Intervju: Dr. Taras Kermauner<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030937/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-taras-kermauner/ |date=2008-04-11 }}</ref> The playwright [[Dominik Smole]] dedicated the play ''[[Antigone (Dominik Smole)|Antigone]]'' to him and [[Primo\u017e Kozak]] portrayed him in the leading role of his play ''Afera'' (The Scandal). Both plays were metaphors for the totalitarian repression in communist Yugoslavia.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n== Exile and academic career ==\n\nPu\u010dnik was released from jail in 1966. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a job, he decided to emigrate to [[Germany]]. He settled in [[Hamburg]], making a living from manual jobs. When he decided to enrol as a postgraduate student at the [[University of Hamburg]], the University of Ljubljana refused to provide him with a copy of his degree.<ref>[http://www.ijpucnik.si/joze_pucnik In\u0161titut Jo\u017eeta Pu\u010dnika => joze pucnik<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316065721/http://www.ijpucnik.si/joze_pucnik |date=2008-03-16 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 /> He thus enrolled again to [[undergraduate]] study of [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], obtaining his [[PhD]] in 1971. He worked at the universities of Hamburg and [[L\u00fcneburg]], where he taught sociology. During his life in Germany, Pu\u010dnik became a supporter of the [[German Social Democratic Party]], maintaining close relations with several of its leaders. In the late 1980s, he became an open admirer of the Social Democratic leader of [[Lower Saxony]] [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]], later [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor of Germany]], whom he took as his main role model for his subsequent political activity.<ref>Taras Kermauner, Skupinski portret z Du\u0161anom Pirjevcem. Ljubljana: Znanstveno in raziskovalno sredi\u0161\u010de, 2002. P. 139</ref>\n\nIn the academic sphere, he became influenced by the theories of [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his [[system theory]], as well as by several phenomenological sociologists such as [[Alfred Schutz]] and the [[Slovenes|Slovene]]-born [[Thomas Luckmann]].<ref>http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&id=F681B62B-37ED-4910-8E7B-93F5B140CCE7</ref> \n\nDuring his years of exile, he kept up a correspondence with several important critical intellectuals in Slovenia, especially [[Ivo Urban\u010di\u010d]].\n\n== Return to Slovenia ==\n\nIn the 1980s, Pu\u010dnik could again publish articles in Slovenia, this time in the alternative journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. In 1987, he co-authored the [[Contributions to the Slovenian National Program]], published in the 57th issue of the Nova revija journal. The text was written as the response to the [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] of 1986, and set the grounds for a political opposition to the communist regime. It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. Pu\u010dnik's article was centred on issues of democratization and political plurality, and openly stressed the need for Slovenia's full sovereignty in order to secure such development.\n\nHe returned to Slovenia in 1989 at the invitation of the newly formed opposition [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Union of Slovenia]]. He was elected president of the party in 1989 and the following year he was chosen as the leader of the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], a common platform of all democratic opposition parties in Slovenia. The coalition won the first democratic elections in 1990. Pu\u010dnik ran for [[President of Slovenia]] but lost to [[Milan Ku\u010dan]], the last secretary general of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]]. He was nevertheless elected to the [[Slovenian Parliament]] and remained the official leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, and the coalition's parliamentary leader. \n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, he was among those who led [[Slovenia]] to independence from [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1992, after the fall of [[Lojze Peterle]]'s coalition government, Pu\u010dnik decided to lead his party into a coalition with the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]] and briefly served as vice-president in the first government of [[Janez Drnov\u0161ek]].\n\nIn the elections of 1992, the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] suffered a complete defeat, gaining a mere 3.4% of the vote, barely securing the entry into the Parliament. Pu\u010dnik resigned as president of the party in favour of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]. Between 1992 and 1996, Pu\u010dnik served as a member of the [[National Assembly of Slovenia]]. During this time, he led a parliamentary commission to clarify political responsibility for the summary executions perpetrated by the communist regime in Slovenia after [[World War II]] .\n\nAfter 1996, he retired from active politics, but remained honorary president of the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] and continued to voice his opinion on matters of public interest. He remained utterly critical of the policies of [[Prime Minister of Slovenia|Prime Minister]] [[Janez Drnov\u0161ek]] and President [[Milan Ku\u010dan]]. He also criticized the political transition to democracy in general, especially the insufficient implementation of the rule of law, the widespread corruption and the maintenance of the power networks from the previous regime.\n\nHe died in Germany in 2003 and was buried in his home village of \u010cre\u0161njevec. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd. The eulogy was delivered by philosopher and his lifelong friend [[Ivo Urban\u010di\u010d]].\n\n== Legacy ==\nPu\u010dnik is considered to be one of the fathers of independent Slovenia.<ref>[http://druzina.si/icd/spletnastran.nsf/all/ccd4e15db3744c51c12573c600365d07?OpenDocument&Click= V \u010dast domovini: Stati inu obstati], 6 January 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskenovice.si/clanek/o144141 |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910093754/http://www.slovenskenovice.si/clanek/o144141 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/sest-let-od-smrti-jozeta-pucnika/96000 Posmrtno odlikovanje za Jo\u017eeta Pu\u010dnika Pu\u010dnikovega odlikovanja ni prevzel nih\u010de Objavljeno], 22 June 2006</ref> Some, especially in the Slovenian right wing circles, have also called him \"Father of Slovenian Democracy\".<ref>[http://www.prebold.sds.si/news/27114 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317061343/http://www.prebold.sds.si/news/27114 |date=March 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, he was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Distinct Merits of Slovenia]].
