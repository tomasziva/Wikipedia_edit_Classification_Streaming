{"title_page": "I. L. Peretz Folk School", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n\nThe '''I.L. Peretz Folk School''' of [[Winnipeg]] was founded in the city's [[Jewish]] district in the years immediately following the explosion of Jewish population in Winnipeg's North End caused by antisemitic [[pogroms]] in [[Russia]] that peaked in the 1880s.\n\nThe school was named for one of the greatest [[Yiddish]] authors and playwrights, Isaac Leib Peretz (May 18, 1852 \u2013 1915), also known as Yitskhok Leybush Peretz, best known as [[I.L. Peretz]] (or more popularly among Yiddish speakers as Yud Lamed Peretz, using his Hebrew-language initials).\n\nAs the city of Winnipeg's Jewish population grew, notably during the post-World War II years, many middle-class families began purchasing homes in the new suburban housing developments in the northwest area of West Kildonan (and district of the city at the time). The development known as Garden City rapidly became populous enough to justify the building of a second school. The original school on Aikins Avenue in the older part of the city's north end continued in full operation. The newer second school, on Jefferson Avenue, flourished and through obvious need attracted a younger and more contemporary group of teachers.\n\nThroughout its history, it held co-educational classes in both [[Yiddish]] and [[English language|English]] up through Grade VII. Declining enrolment and rising costs during the 1980s led to its closing and absorption by the [[Talmud Torah]], a more religiously oriented, Hebrew-language day school on Matheson Avenue, which created a Yiddish-language track to accommodate those interested in continuing education in Yiddish. The Talmud Torah name, in turn, disappeared when all parochial Jewish education in Winnipeg was moved to the new [[Asper Jewish Community Campus]] in Tuxedo during the 1990s.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Isadore Coop]] (1926\u20132003), Canadian architect\n*[[Velvl Greene]] (1928\u20132011), Canadian\u2013American\u2013Israeli scientist and academic\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/organization/peretzschool.shtml History of the school]\n*[http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/winnipeg-celebrate-100-years-jewish-education Additional history of the school]\n*[http://www.arbeterring.org I.
