Several Arab tribes attempted to fight him on the way, but were defeated.\n\nWhen news of the advance of Abraha's army came, the Arab tribes of the Quraysh, Banu Kinanah, [[Banu Khuza'a]] and Banu Hudhayl united in defense of the Ka\u2018bah. A man from the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. [[Abd_al-Muttalib|\u2018Abdul Muttalib]] told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he with some leading members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Ka\u2018bah. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\"\n\nThe reference to the story in [[Qur\u2019an]] is rather short. According to [[Sura]]h [[al-Fil]], the next day [as Abraha prepared to enter the city], a dark cloud of [[Restless flycatcher|small birds]] named '[[Ababil (mythology)|Ababil]]' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0640\u0627\u0628\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}) appeared. The birds carried [[Lava|small rocks]] in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them like \"eaten straw\". However according to [[Muhammad Asad]] this surah does not describe birds literally carrying small rocks, he instead, referencing [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] translates the above mentioned verses as:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|(2)Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures (3) which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Message 8f The Quran, by Mohammad Asad, Surah 105:2-3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n|}\nMohammad Asad the words used in this verse, namely the \"stones of sijjil\", denote  \"a writing and, tropically, something that has been decreed [by God]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid M. Asad, Commentary on Surah 102, see note 2|quote=Lit., \"with stones of sijjil\". As explained in note [114] on 11:82, this latter term is synonymous with sijill, which signifies \"a writing\" and, tropically, \"something that has been decreed [by God]\": hence, the phrase hijarah min sijjil is a metaphor for \"stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., in God's decree (Zamakhshari and Razi, with analogous comments on the same expression in 11:82).}}</ref> He further explains that this decree by god was a very sudden epidemic outbreak, which, according to Ibn Ishaq, caused fever (in arabic hasbah) and smallpox (arab. judari). This, as Asad concludes, points to the fact that the \"stone hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\" were a very sudden virulent epidemic due to the fact that the word for fever \"hasbah\" primarily means \"pelting [or smiting] with stones\" in the famous arabic dictionary ''al-Qamous'' (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0633) by [[Fairuzabadi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As already mentioned in the introductory note, the particular chastisement to which the above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden epidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and Muhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham and Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted fever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land of the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word hasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies also typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with stones\" (Qamus)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Al-Qamus Al-Muhit by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Ja\u02bbq\u016bb al- F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The word ta'ir can denote any \"flying creature, whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus)\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As regards the noun ta'ir (of which tayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes any \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus).

If the hypothesis of an epidemic is correct, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or insects - may well have been the carriers of the infection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the nature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it was certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word - namely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it brought to the distressed people of Mecca.}}</ref>\n\n==Shia==\nAccording to [[Hadith]], in al-Kafi Volume one, Imam [[Ali]] was born in the 30th year of the Elephant<ref>{{cite web |title=The birth of El Imam Ali related to the year of the elephant |url=http://balaghah.net/old/nahj-htm/eng/id/article/46.htm |website=balaghah.net |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref> and died in AH&nbsp;40.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Al-Islam|first1=Thiqatu|title=Al-Kafi|date=2015|publisher=Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9914308-6-4|page=457|edition=Second|url=http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027221543/http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\n== Other sources ==\nThis event is referred to in the Qur\u2019an, in [[Sura]]h 105, ''[[Al-Fil]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0640\u0641\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}, \"The Elephant\"), and is discussed in its related [[tafsir]].\n\nSome scholars have placed the Year of the Elephant one or two decades earlier than 570 CE,<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped03espo_0/page/154 154]|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World: Libe-Sare|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L.

[[Abd_al-Muttalib|\u2018Abdul Muttalib]] told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he with some leading members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Ka\u2018bah. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\"\n\nThe reference to the story in [[Qur\u2019an]] is rather short. According to [[Sura]]h [[al-Fil]], the next day [as Abraha prepared to enter the city], a dark cloud of [[Restless flycatcher|small birds]] named '[[Ababil (mythology)|Ababil]]' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0640\u0627\u0628\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}) appeared. The birds carried [[Lava|small rocks]] in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them like \"eaten straw\". However according to [[Muhammad Asad]] this surah does not describe birds literally carrying small rocks, he instead, referencing [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] translates the above mentioned verses as:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|(2)Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures (3) which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Message 8f The Quran, by Mohammad Asad, Surah 105:2-3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n|}\nMohammad Asad the words used in this verse, namely the \"stones of sijjil\", denote  \"a writing and, tropically, something that has been decreed [by God]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid M. Asad, Commentary on Surah 102, see note 2|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Lit., \"with stones of sijjil\". As explained in note [114] on\u00a011:82, this latter term is synonymous with sijill, which signifies \"a writing\" and, tropically, \"something that has been decreed [by God]\": hence, the phrase hijarah min sijjil is a metaphor for \"stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., in God's decree (Zamakhshari and Razi, with analogous comments on the same expression in\u00a011:82).}}</ref> He further explains that this decree by god was a very sudden epidemic outbreak, which, according to Ibn Ishaq, caused fever (in arabic hasbah) and smallpox (arab. judari). This, as Asad concludes, points to the fact that the \"stone hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\" were a very sudden virulent epidemic due to the fact that the word for fever \"hasbah\" primarily means \"pelting [or smiting] with stones\" in the famous arabic dictionary ''al-Qamous'' (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0633) by [[Fairuzabadi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As already mentioned in the introductory note, the particular chastisement to which the above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden epidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and Muhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham and Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted fever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land of the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word hasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies also typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with stones\" (Qamus)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Al-Qamus Al-Muhit by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Ja\u02bbq\u016bb al- F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The word ta'ir can denote any \"flying creature, whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus)\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As regards the noun ta'ir (of which tayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes any \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus). Neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Tradition offers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flying creatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, on the other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by the commentators are purely imaginary, they need not be seriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic is correct, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or insects - may well have been the carriers of the infection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the nature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it was certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word - namely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it brought to the distressed people of Mecca.}}</ref>\n\n==Shia==\nAccording to [[Hadith]], in al-Kafi Volume one, Imam [[Ali]] was born in the 30th year of the Elephant<ref>{{cite web |title=The birth of El Imam Ali related to the year of the elephant |url=http://balaghah.net/old/nahj-htm/eng/id/article/46.htm |website=balaghah.net |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref> and died in AH&nbsp;40.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Al-Islam|first1=Thiqatu|title=Al-Kafi|date=2015|publisher=Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9914308-6-4|page=457|edition=Second|url=http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027221543/http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\n== Other sources ==\nThis event is referred to in the Qur\u2019an, in [[Sura]]h 105, ''[[Al-Fil]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0640\u0641\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}, \"The Elephant\"), and is discussed in its related [[tafsir]].\n\nSome scholars have placed the Year of the Elephant one or two decades earlier than 570 CE,<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped03espo_0/page/154 154]|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World: Libe-Sare|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L.
