This was the first game in the newly renovated Commonwealth Stadium.  The $120 million renovation includes player amenities such as a recruiting room and patio atop a tunnel leading to a new synthetic turf field. The Wildcats initially gave a sellout crowd of 62,933 something to feel good about on the field and in their seats before things turned sour.\n\nStanley \"Boom\" Williams' ran for a 75-yard TD on the game's first play. Williams' speed helped the Wildcats deliver just 16 seconds in. Last year's team rushing leader blew through a big hole up the middle and off for a big TD that brought a roar from the packed house before they got comfortable in their seats. He finished with 135 yards on 10 carries.\n\nPatrick Towles' five-yard touchdown pass to Blake Bone provided a 33\u201310 lead late in the third quarter. But Austin MacGinnis' missed extra point opened the door for the Ragin' Cajuns to rally with TD runs of 56 and 26 yards by Torrey Pierce and a 23-yarder by Jalen Nixon.\n\nElijah McGuire's game-tying two point conversion run with 7:36 left created more anxiety, especially for Kentucky when Towles fumbled a fourth-and-1 snap at Louisiana's 49. The junior somehow recovered the ball for a two-yard gain to extend the drive.  Five plays later Horton's 12-yard run with 57 seconds remaining put Kentucky ahead for good.\n\nJosh Forrest intercepted Brooks Haack's Hail Mary pass as time expired to preserve Kentucky's narrow win on a wild but long night that included a faulty game clock and even lightning in the near distance along with the drone crash.\n\nTowles passed for 257 yards and TDs of 35 yards to Garrett Johnson, 37 to Jeff Badet and Bone.\n\n====At South Carolina====\n{{See also|2015 South Carolina Gamecocks football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kentucky Wildcats vs South Carolina Gamecocks \u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 12, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road='''Kentucky'''\n|R1=14|R2=10|R3=0|R4=2\n|home=South Carolina\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=9\n|stadium= [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] \u2022 [[Columbia, South Carolina]] \t\n|attendance=82,178\n|weather=75 deg., Clear\n|referee=Ken Williamson\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brent Musburger]] (Play-by-play), [[Jesse Palmer]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"USCPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/55edace7e4b06699c1c4ba19 |title=South Carolina pre-game notes |date=September 7, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 7, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"USCStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015 |title=Kentucky vs South Carolina: Scoring Summary |date=September 12, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916012853/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015# |archive-date=September 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Connor Mitch, 1 yard run ([[Elliott Fry]] kick), 12:30 (USC 7\u20130)\n* UK \u2013 Mikel Horton, 8-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (TIED 7\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 2-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (UK 14\u20137)\n;Second Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 29-yard field goal, 7:29 (UK 17\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 0:17 (UK 24\u20137)\n;Third Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 29-yard field goal, 11:13 (UK 24\u201310)\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 6:18 (UK 24\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 14:14 (UK 24\u201316)\n* USC \u2013 Jerrell Adams, 33-yard pass from Perry Orth (Pharoah Cooper rush fumbled), 8:09 (UK 24\u201322)\n* UK \u2013 Denzil Ware, PAT return, 8:09 (UK 26\u201322)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 21/29, 192\n* USC \u2013 Orth \u2013 13/20, 179\n;Top Rushers\n* UK \u2013 B.

Mark Stoops started the week reminding the Wildcats they hadn't had a winning road trip in his three-year tenure. They ended the week celebrating a 26 to 22 road victory at South Carolina on Saturday in front of 82,178 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia. The victory for Kentucky broke a 22-game losing streak in road games with the Wildcats last road win coming at Louisville in September 2010. Kentucky's last SEC road victory was at Georgia in November 2009. UK is now 2\u20130 on the season and starts conference play with a victory for the first time since defeating Arkansas in 2007 in Fayetteville.\n\nHeading into halftime with a 24\u20137 lead, South Carolina scored the first 15 points of the second half, including three Elliott Fry field goals and a 33-yard touchdown pass from Perry Orth, who was playing for injured Gamecock quarterback Conner Mitch, to Jerrell Adams, to cut the UK lead to 24\u201322.  The Gamecocks and head coach Steve Spurrier decided to go for the two-point conversion to try to tie the game before freshman Denzil Ware scooped up a fumble and returned it 98 yards for two points to give UK a 26\u201322 lead with 8:09 to go in the game. After a short drive by the UK offense, South Carolina started another drive on a tired Kentucky defense before another freshman made a big play with rookie cornerback Chris Westry earning his first-career interception to put the Wildcats back in the driver's seat.  The Wildcat offense, who struggled for much of the second half, sealed the victory from there, taking the final 4:32 off the clock, including a key 11-yard quarterback draw by Patrick Towles on third down to drain the Gamecocks of timeouts. Sophomore Stanley \"Boom\" Williams took over from there with a 25-yard rush to end the game.\n\n====Vs.

Trailing 14-3 going into the fourth quarter, the Wildcats made it a one-score game behind two Austin MacGinnis field goals and had the ball twice over the final five minutes in an attempt to score the go-ahead touchdown. Kentucky's final drive of the night began on its own 20-yard line and was dissipated by a Quincy Wilson interception on fourth-and-27 to lift the Gators to the win.\n\nKentucky's defense stymied the Gator attack for the entire second half. Five Wildcats registered six or more tackles on the night, led by Khalid Henderson's nine stops.   UK posted three tackles for a loss and J.D. Harmon picked off a pass in the end zone to halt a Florida drive in the middle of the third quarter that would have pushed UF's lead to three scores. The interception sparked a momentum change in the game as UK would go on to put together back-to-back scoring drives.\n\nUK quarterback Patrick Towles was 8 of 24 on the night with 126 yards and two interceptions. Running back Stanley \"Boom\" Williams rushed 16 times for 80 yards \u2013 snapping his three-game 100-yard rushing streak. Dorian Baker led the receivers with four hauls for 38 yards, including a big fourth-down catch late in the game.  Florida's Will Grier threw for 125 yards and rushed for a team-high 61 yards that included a 1-yard touchdown scamper in the opening quarter.\n\nFollowing Harmon's interception in the third quarter, Towles' 33-yard scramble highlighted a 75-yard drive by the Wildcats to inch closer at 14\u20136 with 14:50 in the fourth. MacGinnis connected on a 22-yard field goal for the Wildcats to make it a one-possession game.  After the UK defense forced a three-and-out, MacGinnis made it a five-point contest with 10:57 to go with a 45-yard field goal. Towles found Jeff Badet for a 45-yard strike down the left sideline to push the Wildcats into field-goal range as the drive's highlight.\n\nFollowing UK's third field goal of the game, Florida managed one first down before being forced to punt with 8:34 remaining. Faced with a third-and-10 from its own 22, Towles found Baker open on the right sideline to keep the drive alive. Williams followed with a 14-yard rush, but the drive stalled at UK's 48. Punter Landon Foster pinned the Gators inside the 20 with 6:10 to go.   The Gators picked up two first downs and killed 3:44 of clock before punting back to the Wildcats, which began the final drive at their own 20. Towles and Baker hooked up for a 20-yard gain on fourth-and-3 at the Kentucky 27 to keep the drive alive. Florida sacked Towles for a loss of 12 on third-and-10 from the UK 47 and then the Wildcats committed a false start. Towels' deep ball down the left side line intended for Ryan Timmons was picked off by Wilson to preserve the Gators' victory.\n\n====Vs.

Towles led UK to its first league victory at the New Commonwealth Stadium and its first win over a ranked opponent since 2010 when Kentucky defeated No. 9 South Carolina. The win over the Tigers signified the first win over a top-25 opponent in the Mark Stoops era.\n\nTowles directed scoring drives in the third and fourth quarters to ignite the offensive effort in the second half. The junior gunslinger found CJ Conrad for a 24-yard strike before connecting with Dorian Baker with less than seven minutes to play to give the Wildcats a 14-point lead it would not relinquish.  Towles had his most consistent game of the season, connecting on 22-of-27 passes for 249 yards with the two touchdown passes. He also added a 14-yard scamper for a score in the opening half.\n\nDefensively, C.J. Johnson paced the Wildcats with 11 tackles, besting his career high by five. Senior linebacker Josh Forrest added nine tackles, while Jason Hatcher posted eight stops to aid the stout defensive effort. Kentucky yielded just 14 points per game through its opening three games against SEC foes.\n\nKentucky, which had not won against Mizzou since the Tigers joined the SEC in 2012, had a number of player milestones as well. With his 6-yard carry with 1:24 remaining in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory, running back JoJo Kemp became the 34th Wildcat to rush for 1,000 yards in a career. The junior led the UK attack on the ground, racking up 66 yards on 13 attempts.  Garrett Johnson led the team in receiving with a season-high 119 yards, including a long of 35 yards that matched his season best. Conrad had a breakout game, not only recording his first career catch but also his first career touchdown with 55 yards of offense through the air. Baker also had a standout game, matching his career high of 51 yards and recording the second touchdown of his career.\n\nFollowing a rocky start to the drive that found the Wildcats in a first-and-29 situation, Towles found Johnson for consecutive 20-plus-yard throws to move the chains and get UK into Missouri territory for the first time in the contest. Kentucky continued to cruise downfield, closing out the quarter on the 14-yard line.  The short break did not derail the Wildcats as Towles used the opening play of the second quarter to dodge and weave through the Tiger defense for a rushing touchdown. That knotted the score at seven apiece.   Much like the start of the game, the second half started slow before Missouri struck late in the third quarter. However, the Tigers were left to settle for a field goal in lieu of a touchdown with 6:04 remaining, with Andrew Baggett sending a 39-yarder through the uprights to give MU a slight 10\u20137 edge.\n\nKemp acted as the catalyst for the team, as three of his carries totaled a combined 37 yards, giving UK a first-and-goal late in the third quarter. Though Kemp moved the offense down the field for the bulk of the drive, it was Conrad who would complete it for the Wildcats, pulling down a perfect 24-yard toss from Towles for the first touchdown of his career. With the addition of the extra point, Kentucky was able to take its first lead of the game with just under two minutes remaining in the third quarter, leading by a count of 14\u201310.\n\n====Vs. <small>(FCS)</small> Eastern Kentucky====\n{{See also|2015 Eastern Kentucky Colonels football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Eastern Kentucky vs Kentucky Wildcats \u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 3, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road=Eastern Kentucky\n|R1=0|R2=6|R3=7|R4=14|R5=0\n|home='''Kentucky'''\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=14|H5=7\n|stadium= [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] \u2022 [[Lexington, Kentucky]] \t\n|attendance=63,380\n|weather=50 deg., Light rain\n|referee= David Smith\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= Mike Couzens (Play-by-play), [[Cole Cubelic]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"EKUPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/56099cd8e4b0f197185e768a |title=Eastern Kentucky pre-game notes |date=September 28, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 21, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"EKUStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015 |title=Eastern Kentucky vs. Kentucky: Scoring Summary |date=October 4, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006094708/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015# |archive-date=October 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 0:51 (UK 7\u20130)\n;Second Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 1-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick failed), 8:49 (UK 7\u20136)\n;Third Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Bennie Coney, 1-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 10:59 (EKU 13\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jeff Badet, 36-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick failed), 8:23 (Tied 13\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Dy'Shawn Mobley, 6-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 12:50 (EKU 20\u201313)\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 15-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick), 7:39 (EKU 27\u201313)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 7-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 4:59 (EKU 27\u201320)\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:52 (Tied 27\u201327)\n;Overtime\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:00 (UK 34\u201327)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* EKU \u2013 Coney \u2013 19/32, 183\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 29/42, 329\n;Top Rushers\n* EKU \u2013 Thomas \u2013 20\u201384\n* UK \u2013 Kemp \u2013 14\u201346\n;Top Receiving\n* EKU \u2013 Mobley \u2013 5\u201350\n* UK \u2013 Baker \u2013 8\u201386\n}}\n\nDespite trailing by 14 points with less than eight minutes in the fourth quarter, the Kentucky football team celebrated its 100th Homecoming anniversary at The New CWS in thrilling fashion, notching a 34-27 comeback overtime victory over in-state foe Eastern Kentucky.\n\nKentucky rallied from a 27\u201313 deficit late in the fourth quarter with back-to-back game-saving drives. Facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of regulation, Patrick Towles stood in the face of a blitz and found Dorian Baker for a 5-yard touchdown to force overtime.\n\nThe duo connected again in overtime with a 3-yard pitch-and-catch to take a 34\u201327 lead. CJ Johnson, who recorded 19 tackles, the most by a defensive lineman in program history, fittingly sealed the outcome with a game-clinching sack.  Eight of Johnson's 19 tackles were solo stops, including a sack and two-and-a-half tackles for loss. Ryan Flannigan was one tackle off his career best with 11 tackles, Josh Forrest recorded double-digit tackles with 10 stops on the night, and Farrington Huguenin blocked a field goal and recovered a fumble.\n\nCoupled with 2014's opening five games, it marks the first time that UK has been 4-1 for two consecutive seasons since 1976\u201377.\n \nTowles rebounded from a two-interception first half to lead the offense for the Wildcats, connecting on 29-of-42 pass attempts for 329 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a rushing score. Towles surpassed the 300-yard mark for the first time this season and the fourth of his career.  The duo of Baker and Blake Bone carried the offense in receiving with 86 and 85 yards, respectively. Both bested their career highs by more than 20 yards each, and Baker's two touchdowns, which included the game-tying and game-winning catches, is a career best for the wide receiver. \n \nThe Wildcats retain an unblemished all-time record against the Colonels and advance to 4\u20131 on the season with the victory.\n\n====Vs.

Auburn earned a 10-point advantage at 30\u201320 with less than eight minutes to play before the Wildcats pulled to within three following a Mikel Horton 1-yard plunge. Kentucky was able to get the ball back with 2:12 remaining, but UK failed to convert on fourth-and-3 from the Auburn 44 to allow the Tigers to clinch the victory.\n\nPatrick Towles posted more than 300 yards of offense for the second consecutive game, racking up 359 yards on 27-of-44 passing with one interception. The junior gunslinger had five 20-plus-yard tosses for the evening, including a pair of throws longer than 35 yards.  Garrett Johnson was Towles' primary target for the long ball, as he posted a career-best 160 yards receiving, including a season-long 39-yard catch that started a drive to help the Wildcats chip away at a 10-point deficit in the second quarter.  Marcus McWilson led the way for the UK defense, tying his career best in total tackles after making 10 stops.

On the ground, Peyton Barber rushed for 92 yards and two touchdowns, while Kerryon Johnson added 36 yards and a touchdown for Auburn.\n\nKentucky's running backs paced the team in scoring, with Stanley \"Boom\" Williams returning to action to rush for 113 yards and two touchdowns, including a 60-yard sprint that the sophomore would follow up with the opening touchdown for the Wildcats.

Mike Edwards returned an interception 20 yards for another Wildcats score that handed the 49ers (2-9) their ninth straight loss.  Redshirt freshman Drew Barker added 129 yards passing in his first career start for Kentucky, which earned the first of two wins needed to reach the threshold for bowl eligibility. The Wildcats' defense held Charlotte to just 233 yards, recorded four sacks and forced three turnovers.  Miles Butler kicked field goals of 21, 46 and 32 yards for Kentucky.  Kentucky registered 50 points for the first time since August 2014 against UT Martin, and their 48-point victory margin was its largest since beating UTEP 77\u201317 in 2002.\n\n====Vs.

This was the first game in the newly renovated Commonwealth Stadium.  The $120 million renovation includes player amenities such as a recruiting room and patio atop a tunnel leading to a new synthetic turf field. The Wildcats initially gave a sellout crowd of 62,933 something to feel good about on the field and in their seats before things turned sour.\n\nStanley \"Boom\" Williams' ran for a 75-yard TD on the game's first play. Williams' speed helped the Wildcats deliver just 16 seconds in. Last year's team rushing leader blew through a big hole up the middle and off for a big TD that brought a roar from the packed house before they got comfortable in their seats. He finished with 135 yards on 10 carries.\n\nPatrick Towles' five-yard touchdown pass to Blake Bone provided a 33\u201310 lead late in the third quarter. But Austin MacGinnis' missed extra point opened the door for the Ragin' Cajuns to rally with TD runs of 56 and 26 yards by Torrey Pierce and a 23-yarder by Jalen Nixon.\n\nElijah McGuire's game-tying two point conversion run with 7:36 left created more anxiety, especially for Kentucky when Towles fumbled a fourth-and-1 snap at Louisiana's 49. The junior somehow recovered the ball for a two-yard gain to extend the drive.  Five plays later Horton's 12-yard run with 57 seconds remaining put Kentucky ahead for good.\n\nJosh Forrest intercepted Brooks Haack's Hail Mary pass as time expired to preserve Kentucky's narrow win on a wild but long night that included a faulty game clock and even lightning in the near distance along with the drone crash.\n\nTowles passed for 257 yards and TDs of 35 yards to Garrett Johnson, 37 to Jeff Badet and Bone.\n\n====At South Carolina====\n{{See also|2015 South Carolina Gamecocks football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kentucky Wildcats vs South Carolina Gamecocks \u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 12, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road='''Kentucky'''\n|R1=14|R2=10|R3=0|R4=2\n|home=South Carolina\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=9\n|stadium= [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] \u2022 [[Columbia, South Carolina]] \t\n|attendance=82,178\n|weather=75 deg., Clear\n|referee=Ken Williamson\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brent Musburger]] (Play-by-play), [[Jesse Palmer]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"USCPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/55edace7e4b06699c1c4ba19 |title=South Carolina pre-game notes |date=September 7, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 7, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"USCStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015 |title=Kentucky vs South Carolina: Scoring Summary |date=September 12, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916012853/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/cats-take-down-south-carolina-move-to-2-0-09-12-2015# |archive-date=September 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Connor Mitch, 1 yard run ([[Elliott Fry]] kick), 12:30 (USC 7\u20130)\n* UK \u2013 Mikel Horton, 8-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (TIED 7\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 2-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 7:49 (UK 14\u20137)\n;Second Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 29-yard field goal, 7:29 (UK 17\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 0:17 (UK 24\u20137)\n;Third Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 29-yard field goal, 11:13 (UK 24\u201310)\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 6:18 (UK 24\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* USC \u2013 Elliott Fry, 21-yard field goal, 14:14 (UK 24\u201316)\n* USC \u2013 Jerrell Adams, 33-yard pass from Perry Orth (Pharoah Cooper rush fumbled), 8:09 (UK 24\u201322)\n* UK \u2013 Denzil Ware, PAT return, 8:09 (UK 26\u201322)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 21/29, 192\n* USC \u2013 Orth \u2013 13/20, 179\n;Top Rushers\n* UK \u2013 B.

Mark Stoops started the week reminding the Wildcats they hadn't had a winning road trip in his three-year tenure. They ended the week celebrating a 26 to 22 road victory at South Carolina on Saturday in front of 82,178 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia. The victory for Kentucky broke a 22-game losing streak in road games with the Wildcats last road win coming at Louisville in September 2010. Kentucky's last SEC road victory was at Georgia in November 2009. UK is now 2\u20130 on the season and starts conference play with a victory for the first time since defeating Arkansas in 2007 in Fayetteville.\n\nHeading into halftime with a 24\u20137 lead, South Carolina scored the first 15 points of the second half, including three Elliott Fry field goals and a 33-yard touchdown pass from Perry Orth, who was playing for injured Gamecock quarterback Conner Mitch, to Jerrell Adams, to cut the UK lead to 24\u201322.  The Gamecocks and head coach Steve Spurrier decided to go for the two-point conversion to try to tie the game before freshman Denzil Ware scooped up a fumble and returned it 98 yards for two points to give UK a 26\u201322 lead with 8:09 to go in the game. After a short drive by the UK offense, South Carolina started another drive on a tired Kentucky defense before another freshman made a big play with rookie cornerback Chris Westry earning his first-career interception to put the Wildcats back in the driver's seat.  The Wildcat offense, who struggled for much of the second half, sealed the victory from there, taking the final 4:32 off the clock, including a key 11-yard quarterback draw by Patrick Towles on third down to drain the Gamecocks of timeouts. Sophomore Stanley \"Boom\" Williams took over from there with a 25-yard rush to end the game.\n\n====Vs.

Trailing 14-3 going into the fourth quarter, the Wildcats made it a one-score game behind two Austin MacGinnis field goals and had the ball twice over the final five minutes in an attempt to score the go-ahead touchdown. Kentucky's final drive of the night began on its own 20-yard line and was dissipated by a Quincy Wilson interception on fourth-and-27 to lift the Gators to the win.\n\nKentucky's defense stymied the Gator attack for the entire second half. Five Wildcats registered six or more tackles on the night, led by Khalid Henderson's nine stops.   UK posted three tackles for a loss and J.D. Harmon picked off a pass in the end zone to halt a Florida drive in the middle of the third quarter that would have pushed UF's lead to three scores. The interception sparked a momentum change in the game as UK would go on to put together back-to-back scoring drives.\n\nUK quarterback Patrick Towles was 8 of 24 on the night with 126 yards and two interceptions. Running back Stanley \"Boom\" Williams rushed 16 times for 80 yards \u2013 snapping his three-game 100-yard rushing streak. Dorian Baker led the receivers with four hauls for 38 yards, including a big fourth-down catch late in the game.  Florida's Will Grier threw for 125 yards and rushed for a team-high 61 yards that included a 1-yard touchdown scamper in the opening quarter.\n\nFollowing Harmon's interception in the third quarter, Towles' 33-yard scramble highlighted a 75-yard drive by the Wildcats to inch closer at 14\u20136 with 14:50 in the fourth. MacGinnis connected on a 22-yard field goal for the Wildcats to make it a one-possession game.  After the UK defense forced a three-and-out, MacGinnis made it a five-point contest with 10:57 to go with a 45-yard field goal. Towles found Jeff Badet for a 45-yard strike down the left sideline to push the Wildcats into field-goal range as the drive's highlight.\n\nFollowing UK's third field goal of the game, Florida managed one first down before being forced to punt with 8:34 remaining. Faced with a third-and-10 from its own 22, Towles found Baker open on the right sideline to keep the drive alive. Williams followed with a 14-yard rush, but the drive stalled at UK's 48. Punter Landon Foster pinned the Gators inside the 20 with 6:10 to go.   The Gators picked up two first downs and killed 3:44 of clock before punting back to the Wildcats, which began the final drive at their own 20. Towles and Baker hooked up for a 20-yard gain on fourth-and-3 at the Kentucky 27 to keep the drive alive. Florida sacked Towles for a loss of 12 on third-and-10 from the UK 47 and then the Wildcats committed a false start. Towels' deep ball down the left side line intended for Ryan Timmons was picked off by Wilson to preserve the Gators' victory.\n\n====Vs.

Towles led UK to its first league victory at the New Commonwealth Stadium and its first win over a ranked opponent since 2010 when Kentucky defeated No. 9 South Carolina. The win over the Tigers signified the first win over a top-25 opponent in the Mark Stoops era.\n\nTowles directed scoring drives in the third and fourth quarters to ignite the offensive effort in the second half. The junior gunslinger found CJ Conrad for a 24-yard strike before connecting with Dorian Baker with less than seven minutes to play to give the Wildcats a 14-point lead it would not relinquish.  Towles had his most consistent game of the season, connecting on 22-of-27 passes for 249 yards with the two touchdown passes. He also added a 14-yard scamper for a score in the opening half.\n\nDefensively, C.J. Johnson paced the Wildcats with 11 tackles, besting his career high by five. Senior linebacker Josh Forrest added nine tackles, while Jason Hatcher posted eight stops to aid the stout defensive effort. Kentucky yielded just 14 points per game through its opening three games against SEC foes.\n\nKentucky, which had not won against Mizzou since the Tigers joined the SEC in 2012, had a number of player milestones as well. With his 6-yard carry with 1:24 remaining in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory, running back JoJo Kemp became the 34th Wildcat to rush for 1,000 yards in a career. The junior led the UK attack on the ground, racking up 66 yards on 13 attempts.  Garrett Johnson led the team in receiving with a season-high 119 yards, including a long of 35 yards that matched his season best. Conrad had a breakout game, not only recording his first career catch but also his first career touchdown with 55 yards of offense through the air. Baker also had a standout game, matching his career high of 51 yards and recording the second touchdown of his career.\n\nFollowing a rocky start to the drive that found the Wildcats in a first-and-29 situation, Towles found Johnson for consecutive 20-plus-yard throws to move the chains and get UK into Missouri territory for the first time in the contest. Kentucky continued to cruise downfield, closing out the quarter on the 14-yard line.  The short break did not derail the Wildcats as Towles used the opening play of the second quarter to dodge and weave through the Tiger defense for a rushing touchdown. That knotted the score at seven apiece.   Much like the start of the game, the second half started slow before Missouri struck late in the third quarter. However, the Tigers were left to settle for a field goal in lieu of a touchdown with 6:04 remaining, with Andrew Baggett sending a 39-yarder through the uprights to give MU a slight 10\u20137 edge.\n\nKemp acted as the catalyst for the team, as three of his carries totaled a combined 37 yards, giving UK a first-and-goal late in the third quarter. Though Kemp moved the offense down the field for the bulk of the drive, it was Conrad who would complete it for the Wildcats, pulling down a perfect 24-yard toss from Towles for the first touchdown of his career. With the addition of the extra point, Kentucky was able to take its first lead of the game with just under two minutes remaining in the third quarter, leading by a count of 14\u201310.\n\n====Vs. <small>(FCS)</small> Eastern Kentucky====\n{{See also|2015 Eastern Kentucky Colonels football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Eastern Kentucky vs Kentucky Wildcats \u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 3, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road=Eastern Kentucky\n|R1=0|R2=6|R3=7|R4=14|R5=0\n|home='''Kentucky'''\n|H1=7|H2=0|H3=6|H4=14|H5=7\n|stadium= [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] \u2022 [[Lexington, Kentucky]] \t\n|attendance=63,380\n|weather=50 deg., Light rain\n|referee= David Smith\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= Mike Couzens (Play-by-play), [[Cole Cubelic]] (Analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"EKUPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/56099cd8e4b0f197185e768a |title=Eastern Kentucky pre-game notes |date=September 28, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=September 21, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"EKUStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015 |title=Eastern Kentucky vs. Kentucky: Scoring Summary |date=October 4, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006094708/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-battle-for-comeback-homecoming-overtime-victory-over-eku-10-04-2015# |archive-date=October 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 0:51 (UK 7\u20130)\n;Second Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 1-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick failed), 8:49 (UK 7\u20136)\n;Third Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Bennie Coney, 1-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 10:59 (EKU 13\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Jeff Badet, 36-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick failed), 8:23 (Tied 13\u201313)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* EKU \u2013 Dy'Shawn Mobley, 6-yard run (Lucas Williams kick), 12:50 (EKU 20\u201313)\n* EKU \u2013 Devin Borders, 15-yard pass from Bennie Coney (Lucas Williams kick), 7:39 (EKU 27\u201313)\n* UK \u2013 Jojo Kemp, 7-yard run (Miles Butler kick), 4:59 (EKU 27\u201320)\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:52 (Tied 27\u201327)\n;Overtime\n* UK \u2013 Dorian Baker, 5-yard pass from Patrick Towles (Miles Butler kick), 0:00 (UK 34\u201327)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* EKU \u2013 Coney \u2013 19/32, 183\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 29/42, 329\n;Top Rushers\n* EKU \u2013 Thomas \u2013 20\u201384\n* UK \u2013 Kemp \u2013 14\u201346\n;Top Receiving\n* EKU \u2013 Mobley \u2013 5\u201350\n* UK \u2013 Baker \u2013 8\u201386\n}}\n\nDespite trailing by 14 points with less than eight minutes in the fourth quarter, the Kentucky football team celebrated its 100th Homecoming anniversary at The New CWS in thrilling fashion, notching a 34-27 comeback overtime victory over in-state foe Eastern Kentucky.\n\nKentucky rallied from a 27\u201313 deficit late in the fourth quarter with back-to-back game-saving drives. Facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of regulation, Patrick Towles stood in the face of a blitz and found Dorian Baker for a 5-yard touchdown to force overtime.\n\nThe duo connected again in overtime with a 3-yard pitch-and-catch to take a 34\u201327 lead. CJ Johnson, who recorded 19 tackles, the most by a defensive lineman in program history, fittingly sealed the outcome with a game-clinching sack.  Eight of Johnson's 19 tackles were solo stops, including a sack and two-and-a-half tackles for loss. Ryan Flannigan was one tackle off his career best with 11 tackles, Josh Forrest recorded double-digit tackles with 10 stops on the night, and Farrington Huguenin blocked a field goal and recovered a fumble.\n\nCoupled with 2014's opening five games, it marks the first time that UK has been 4-1 for two consecutive seasons since 1976\u201377.\n \nTowles rebounded from a two-interception first half to lead the offense for the Wildcats, connecting on 29-of-42 pass attempts for 329 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a rushing score. Towles surpassed the 300-yard mark for the first time this season and the fourth of his career.  The duo of Baker and Blake Bone carried the offense in receiving with 86 and 85 yards, respectively. Both bested their career highs by more than 20 yards each, and Baker's two touchdowns, which included the game-tying and game-winning catches, is a career best for the wide receiver. \n \nThe Wildcats retain an unblemished all-time record against the Colonels and advance to 4\u20131 on the season with the victory.\n\n====Vs.

Auburn earned a 10-point advantage at 30\u201320 with less than eight minutes to play before the Wildcats pulled to within three following a Mikel Horton 1-yard plunge. Kentucky was able to get the ball back with 2:12 remaining, but UK failed to convert on fourth-and-3 from the Auburn 44 to allow the Tigers to clinch the victory.\n\nPatrick Towles posted more than 300 yards of offense for the second consecutive game, racking up 359 yards on 27-of-44 passing with one interception. The junior gunslinger had five 20-plus-yard tosses for the evening, including a pair of throws longer than 35 yards.  Garrett Johnson was Towles' primary target for the long ball, as he posted a career-best 160 yards receiving, including a season-long 39-yard catch that started a drive to help the Wildcats chip away at a 10-point deficit in the second quarter.  Marcus McWilson led the way for the UK defense, tying his career best in total tackles after making 10 stops. Josh Forrest was not far behind with nine tackles, and Jason Hatcher also matched his career mark with seven takedowns.\n\nFor the Tigers, Sean White led the team on 17-of-27 passing for 255 yards, 154 of which went into the hands of Ricardo Louis to lead the team in receiving. On the ground, Peyton Barber rushed for 92 yards and two touchdowns, while Kerryon Johnson added 36 yards and a touchdown for Auburn.\n\nKentucky's running backs paced the team in scoring, with Stanley \"Boom\" Williams returning to action to rush for 113 yards and two touchdowns, including a 60-yard sprint that the sophomore would follow up with the opening touchdown for the Wildcats. Horton also notched a touchdown for the Wildcats, making the most of his five carries in the third quarter to bring UK within three points of the Tigers in the final minutes of the game.\n\n====At Mississippi State====\n{{See also|2015 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Kentucky Wildcats}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kentucky Wildcats vs Mississippi State \u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 24, 2015\n|time= 7:30 PM\n|road=Kentucky\n|R1=10|R2=3|R3=3|R4=0\n|home='''Mississippi State'''\n|H1=7|H2=21|H3=7|H4=7\n|stadium= [[Davis Wade Stadium]] \u2022 [[Starkville, Mississippi]] \t\n|attendance= 61,168\n|weather= 75 deg, Partly Cloudy\n|referee= Tom Ritter\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Brent Musburger]] (play-by-play), [[Jesse Palmer]] (analyst)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref name=\"MSUPre\">{{cite web |url=https://kty-platform-secure-prod.silverchalice.co/v3/files/5625088fe4b0b9018928fe9b |title=Mississippi State pre-game notes |date=October 19, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 19, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"MSUStats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-suffer-first-road-loss-of-season-at-miss-state-10-24-2015 |title=Kentucky vs Mississippi State: Scoring Summary |date=October 24, 2015 |work=UKAthletics.com |publisher=University of Kentucky Department of Intercollegiate Athletics |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027051210/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/wildcats-suffer-first-road-loss-of-season-at-miss-state-10-24-2015# |archive-date=October 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Patrick Towles, 1-yard run (Austin MacGinnis kick), 8:19 (UK 7\u20130)\n* MSU \u2013 Dak Prescott, 1-yard run (Westin Graves kick), 5:24 (Tied 7\u20137)\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 44-yard field goal, 1:53 (UK 10\u20137)\n;Second Quarter\n* MSU \u2013 De'Runnya Wilson, 13-yard pass from Prescott (Graves kick), 13:38 (MSU 14\u201310)\n* MSU \u2013 Brandon Holloway, 8-yard pass from Prescott (Graves kick), 1:34 (MSU 21\u201310)\n* MSU \u2013 Dak Prescott, 20-yard run (Graves kick), 0:34 (MSU 28\u201310)\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 48-yard field goal, 0:03 (MSU 28\u201313)\n;Third Quarter\n* UK \u2013 Austin MacGinnis, 32-yard field goal, 2:55 (MSU 28\u201316)\n* MSU \u2013 Darrion Hutcherson, 13-yard pass from Prescott (Graves kick), 0:59 (MSU 35\u201316)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* MSU \u2013 Dak Prescott, 18-yard run (Graves kick), 4:44 (MSU 42\u201316)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* UK \u2013 Towles \u2013 23/42, 218\n* MSU \u2013 Prescott \u2013 25/35, 348\n;Top Rushers\n* UK \u2013 B.

Mike Edwards returned an interception 20 yards for another Wildcats score that handed the 49ers (2-9) their ninth straight loss.  Redshirt freshman Drew Barker added 129 yards passing in his first career start for Kentucky, which earned the first of two wins needed to reach the threshold for bowl eligibility. The Wildcats' defense held Charlotte to just 233 yards, recorded four sacks and forced three turnovers.  Miles Butler kicked field goals of 21, 46 and 32 yards for Kentucky.  Kentucky registered 50 points for the first time since August 2014 against UT Martin, and their 48-point victory margin was its largest since beating UTEP 77\u201317 in 2002.\n\n====Vs.

Kentucky received the opening kickoff and marched down the field, taking a 7\u20130 lead on a one-yard rush by quarterback Drew Barker. After an A.J. Stamps interception, Kentucky took advantage of a short field, going 13 yards in two plays, capped off by a six-yard touchdown rush by Boom Williams to make it 14-0 Kentucky.\n\nOn Louisville's next possession, Kentucky intercepted Louisville quarterback Kyle Bolin for the second time, and Josh Forrest returned the pick 81 yards for a touchdown to make it 21\u20130, still in the first quarter. Louisville got on the board late in the first quarter when backup quarterback [[Lamar Jackson]] rushed 16 yards for a score to make it 21\u20137. In the second quarter, Kentucky added a 20-yard field goal by Miles Butler to take a 24\u20137 lead, which would be the halftime score. Louisville rallied in the second half, eventually taking the lead late in the third quarter, and going on to the victory. Dorian Baker had three catches for 94 yards for Kentucky, while Mikel Horton had 44 yards on the ground to lead the Cats.\n\n==Team statistics==\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"\n|-\n! !!
