{"title_page": "Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy", "text_new": "{{Slavic Native Faith}}\nIn the Russian intellectual milieu, [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery) presents itself as a carrier of the [[political philosophy]] of '''nativism'''/'''nationalism'''/'''populism''' (''narodnichestvo''),{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=141}} intrinsically related to the identity of the [[Slavs]] and the broader group of populations with [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] origins. The scholar Kaarina Aitamurto has defined Rodnovers' applied political systems as forms of '''grassroots democracy''', or as a '''''samoderzhavie''''' (\"people ruling themselves\") system, based on the ancient Slavic model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly) of the elders, similar to ancient [[Greek democracy]]. They generally propose a political system in which power is entrusted to assemblies of consensually-acknowledged wise men, or to a single wise individual.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20135}}\n\nOn the level of [[geopolitics]], to the \"unipolarity\", the \"unipolar\" world, created by the [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|mono-ideologies]] (the [[Abrahamic religions]] and their other ideological products) and led by the [[United States|United States of America]]-dominated West, the Rodnovers oppose the idea of '''\"multipolarity\"''', of a world of many power centres, well represented by the \"Russian Way\". In their view, while the unipolar world is characterised by the [[materialism]] and selfish [[utilitarianism]] of the West, the multipolar world represented by Russia is characterised by [[spirituality]], [[ecology]], [[humanism]] and true equality. The idea of multipolarity is popular among Russian intellectuals, and among Rodnovers it was first formally enunciated in the ''Russian Pagan Manifesto'', published in 1997 by four Russian Rodnover leaders.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=114}}\n\nRodnovery typically gives preeminence to [[individual and group rights|the rights of the collectivity over the rights of the individual]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} The scholar Robert A. Saunders finds that Rodnover ideas are very close to those of [[Eurasianism]], the current leading ideology of the Russian state.{{sfn|Saunders|2019|p=566}} According to [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor Shnirelman]] there is a loose boundary between explicitly political and less political Rodnovers, especially within Russian Rodnovery.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}}\n\n==Origins of the Slavs==\n{{Further|Historical Slavic religion}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate. Wood green represents East Slavic languages, pale green represents West Slavic languages, and sea green represents South Slavic languages.]]\nThe notion that modern Rodnovery is closely tied to the historical religion of the Slavs is a very strong one among practitioners.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=39}} There is no evidence that the [[early Slavs]], a branch of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], ever conceived of themselves as a unified ethno-cultural group.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005b|1p=211|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2017|2p=144}} There is an academic consensus that the [[Proto-Slavic]] language developed from about the second half of the first millennium BCE in an area of Central and Eastern Europe bordered by the [[Dnieper]] basin to the east, the [[Vistula]] basin to the west, the Carpathian Mountains to the south, and the forests beyond the [[Pripet]] basin to the north.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}}\n\nOver the course of several centuries, Slavic populations migrated in northern, eastern, and south-western directions.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}} In doing so, they branched out into three sub-linguistic families: the [[East Slavs]] ([[Ukrainians]], [[Belarussians]], [[Russians]]), the [[West Slavs]] ([[Poles]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]]), and the [[South Slavs]] ([[Slovenes]], [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], and [[Bulgarians]]).{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}} The belief systems of these Slavic communities had many affinities with those of neighbouring linguistic populations, such as the [[Baltic languages|Balts]], [[Thracian language|Thracians]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranians]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}} [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] studied the origin of ancient Slavic themes in the common substratum represented by [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and what [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] studied as the \"[[trifunctional hypothesis]]\". [[Marija Gimbutas]], instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. [[Boris Rybakov]] emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}}\n\n==Political stances and ideas==\n===The grassroots democratic system of the ''veche''===\n[[File:Prono (Montfaucon 1722).jpg|thumb|[[Perun]] (\"Thunder\"), spelled \"Prono\", in an illustration from the ''L'Antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'', Montfaucon, France, 1722.]]\nMany Russian Rodnover groups are strongly [[criticism of democracy|critical of democracy]], modern [[liberal democracy]], which they see as a degenerate form of government that leads to \"cosmopolitan chaos\". According to Shnirelman they favour instead political models of a centralised state led by a strong leader.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012}} Aitamurto, otherwise, characterises the political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \"[[thing (assembly)|thing]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20133}} Nineteenth- and twentieth-century intellectuals often interpreted the ''veche'' as an anti-hierarchic and democratic model, while later Soviet Marxist tended to identify it as \"pre-capitalist democracy\". The term already had ethnic and national connotations, which were underlined by nineteenth-century [[Slavophilia|Slavophiles]], and nationalist circles in the last decades of the Soviet Union and from the 1990s onwards.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=3}}\n\nMany Rodnover groups call their organisational structure ''veche''. Aitamurto finds that it proves to be useful in what she terms as Rodnvery's \"democratic criticism of democracy\" (of liberal democracy). According to her, the ''veche'' as interpreted by Rodnovers represents a vernacular form of governance similar to ancient [[Greek democracy]]. According to the view shared by many Rodnovers, while liberal democracy ends up in chaos because it is driven by the decisions of the masses, who are not wise; the ''veche'' represents a form of \"consensual decision-making\" of assemblies of wise elders, and power is exercised by wise rulers. [[Ynglists]] call this model ''samoderzhavie'', \"people ruling themselves\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=4\u20135}} Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \"outer\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \"inner\" freedom of the mind; in Rodnovers' view, Western liberal democracy is \"destined to execute the primitive desires of the masses or to work as a tool in the hands of a ruthless elite\", being therefore a mean-spirited \"rule of demons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=6-7}} Aitamurto also describes many Rodnovers' political philosophy as elitism, in which not everyone is reputed as having the same decision ability; the most conservative Rodnovers espouse the ideal that \"the opinion of a prostitute cannot have the same weight as the opinion of a professor\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=5}}\n\nIn these ideas of grassroots democracy which comes to fruition in a wise governance, Aitamurto sees an incarnation of the traditional Russian challenge of religious structures and alienated governance\u2014such as autocratic monarchy and totalitarian communism\u2014for achieving a personal relationship with the sacred, which is at the same time a demand of social solidarity and responsibility. She presents the interpretation of the myth of [[Perun]] who slashes the snake guilty of theft, provided by Russian [[volkhv]] Velimir, as symbolising the ideal relationship and collaboration between the ruler and the people, with the ruler serving the people who have chosen him by acting as an authority who provides them with order, and in turn is respected by the people with loyalty for his service.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=5\u20136}} Some Rodnovers interpret the ''veche'' in ethnic terms, thus as a form of \"ethnic democracy\", in the wake of similar concepts found in the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' of [[Alain de Benoist]] (European New Right).{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005b|1p=235|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2008|2p=6}}\n\n===Ethnic nationalism===\nThe scholar Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is fundamentally concerned with ethnic identity.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} This easily develops into forms of [[nationalism]],{{sfn|\u010crni\u010d|2013|p=189}} and has usually been characterised as [[ethnic nationalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=195|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\", that they \"have\u2014or their heritage has\u2014some superior qualities\", and that \"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to Shnirelman, ethnic nationalist and racist views are present even in those Rodnovers who do not identify as politically engaged.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}} He also noted that the movement is \"obsessed with the idea of origin\",{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}} and most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n====Attitudes towards race-mixing====\nIn its founding statement from 1998, the Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers led by the Ukrainian Rodnover leader [[Halyna Lozko]] declared that many of the world's problems stem from the \"mixing of ethnic cultures\", something which it claims has resulted in the \"ruination of the ethnosphere\", which they regard as an integral part of the Earth's [[biosphere]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=229}} For instance, the [[volkhv]] Dobroslav\u2014who holds a position of high respect within Russia's Rodnover community\u2014calls for a \"Russian national socialism\" and \"Pagan socialism\", entailing \"harmony with nature, a national sovereignty and a just social order\".{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2000|1p=18|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=66}}\n\nLev Sylenko, founder of the Ukrainian branch of Rodnovery known as the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]], taught that humanity was naturally divided up into distinct ethno-cultural groups, each with its own life cycle, religiosity, language, and customs, all of which had to spiritually progress in their own way.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|pp=225\u2013226}} Many Ukrainian Rodnovers emphasise a need for ethnic purity and oppose what they regard as \"culturally destructive\" phenomena such as [[cosmopolitanism]], [[liberalism]], and [[globalisation]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=223}} as well as [[Americanisation]] and [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}}\n\nEthnic purity is a central emphasis of groups like the [[Ynglist Church]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=206}} which abhors [[miscegenation]] as unhealthy, and abhors as well what are perceived as perverted sexual behaviours and the consumption of alcohol and drugs. According to the Ynglist Church, all of these are evil influences which come from the degenerating West and threaten Russia. In order to counterweigh them, the Ynglist Church promotes policies such as the \"creation of beneficial descendants\" (''sozidanie blagodetel'nogo potomstva'').{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Various Rodnovers have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n====Proposals for the creation of ethno-states in Russia====\nThere are Russian Rodnovers who promote the common views of Russian nationalism: some seek an imperialist policy that would expand Russia's territory across Europe and Asia, while others seek to reduce the area controlled by the Russian Federation to only those areas with an ethnic Russian majority.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} The place of nationalism, and of ethnic Russians' relationship to other ethnic groups inhabiting the Russian Federation, has been a key issue of discussion among Russian Rodnovers.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} Some express xenophobic views and encourage the removal of those regarded as \"aliens\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\nFor these Rodnovers, ethnic minorities are viewed as the cause of social justice in Russia.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} According to Shnirelman, given that around 20% of the Russian Federation is not ethnically Russian, the ideas of ethnic homogeneity embraced by many Russian Rodnovers could only be achieved through [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Aitamurto notes that the territorial release of several of the majority non-Russian [[republics of Russia]] and [[autonomous okrugs of Russia]] would result in the same reduction of ethnic minorities in Russia without any need for violence whatsoever, which is the approach called for by peaceful Russian Rodnovers.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\n===Antisemitic stances===\nVarious Russian practitioners are openly [[antisemitic]],{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=284}} and express conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control Russia's economic and political elite.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} For example, the Ukrainian leader Halyna Lozko produced a prayer manual titled ''Pravoslav'' in which \"Don't get involved with Jews!\" was listed as the last of ten \"Pagan commandments\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=234}} Extreme right-wing nationalists are also present within the Polish Rodnover community.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nShnirelman observed that Russian practitioners usually deny or downplay the racist and Nazi elements within their community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=62}} There are various Rodnover groups in Russia which are openly inspired by [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=296}} Among those groups that are ideologically akin to [[Neo-Nazism]], the term \"Nazi\" is rarely embraced, in part due to the prominent role that the Soviet Union played in the defeat of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=197}} Some Rodnovers claim that those who adopt such extreme right-wing perspectives are not true Rodnovers because their interests in the movement are primarily political rather than religious.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=62}} According to the scholars Hilary Pilkington and Anton Popov, [[Cossack]] Rodnovers generally eschew Nazism and racial interpretations of the concept of \"[[Aryan]]\".{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=273}}\n\n===De-politicisation movements===\nTrends of de-politicisation of the Russian Rodnover community have been influenced by the introduction of anti-extremist legislation,{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1p=62|2a1=Shizhenskii|2a2=Aitamurto|2y=2017|2p=114}} and the lack of any significant political opposition to the [[United Russia]] government of [[Vladimir Putin]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} Simpson noted that in Poland, there has been an increasing trend to separate the religion from explicitly political activities and ideas during the 2010s.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=71}} The Russian Circle of Pagan Tradition recognises Russia as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural state, and has developed links with other religious communities in the country, such as practitioners of [[Mari Native Faith]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} Members of the Circle of Pagan Tradition prefer to characterise themselves as \"patriots\" rather than \"nationalists\" and seek to avoid any association with the idea of a \"Russia for the Russians\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}} Aitarmurto suggested that the different wings of the Rodnover movement \"attract different kinds of people approaching Paganism from quite diverging points of departure\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=205}} She and Shizhenskii suggested that expressions of ultra-nationalism were considered socially unacceptable at one of the largest Rodnover event in Russia, the Kupala festival outside [[Maloyaroslavets]].{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=129}}\n\n===Influence on already-extant political formations and incidents===\nRodnover ideas and symbols have also been adopted by many Russian nationalists\u2014including in the Russian skinhead movement{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1p=67|2a1=Shizhenskii|2a2=Aitamurto|2y=2017|2pp=115\u2013116}}\u2014not all of whom embrace Rodnovery as a religion.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=156}} Some of these far-right groups merge Rodnover elements with others adopted from Germanic Heathenry and from Russian Orthodox Christianity.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=68}} [[Ynglism]] is characterised by Aitamurto as less politically goal-oriented than other Rodnover movements.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}} However, the Russian scholar of religion Vladimir B. Yashin of the Department of Theology and World Cultures of [[Omsk State University]] wrote in 2001 that the church has close ties with the regional branch of the far-right [[Russian National Unity]] of [[Alexander Barkashov]], whose members provide security and order during the mass gatherings of the Ynglists.<ref name=Maltsev>{{cite article |last=Maltsev |first=V.

Russian interpreters, however, locate this event much further east and north. The ''Book'' contains hymns and prayers, sermons, mythological, theological and political tracts, and historical narrative. It tells the wandering, over about one thousand and five hundred years of the ancestors of the [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], identified as the ''Oryans'' (the book's version of the word \"[[Aryan]]\"), between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], with modern Ukraine ultimately becoming their main homeland. Ivakhiv says that this territorial expansiveness is the main issue that makes historians wary of the ''Book''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} Aitamurto described the work as a \"Romantic description\" of a \"Pagan Golden Age\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nThe fact that many scholars outspokenly reject the ''Book'' as a modern, twentieth-century composition has added to the allure that the text has for many Slavic Native Faith practitioners. According to them, such criticism is an attempt to \"suppress knowledge\" carried forward either by Soviet-style [[scientism]] or by \"Judaic cosmopolitan\" forces. A number of Ukrainian scholars defend the truthfulness of the ''Book'', including literary historian Borys Yatsenko, archaeologist Yuri Shylov, and writers Valery Shevchuk, Serhy Plachynda, Ivan Bilyk, and Yuri Kanyhin. These scholars claim that criticism of the ''Book'' primarily comes from Russians interested in promoting a Russocentric view of history which sets the origin of all [[East Slavs]] in the north, while the ''Book'' shows that southern Rus' civilisation is much older, and nearer to Ukrainians themselves, [[West Slavs]], [[South Slavs]] and the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|eastern Indo-European]] composers of the [[Vedas]], than to Russians.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} For many Ukrainian Rodnovers, the ''Book'' provides them with a cosmology, ethical system, and ritual practices that they can follow, and confirms their belief that the ancient Ukrainians had a literate and advanced civilisation prior to the arrival of Christianity.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=219}} Other modern literary works that have influenced the movement, albeit on a smaller scale, include ''The Songs of the Bird Gamayon'', ''Koliada's Book of Stars'', ''The Song of the Victory on the Jewish Khazaria of Sviatoslav the Brave'' or ''The Rigveda of Kiev''.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=291}}\n\n===Aryans and polar mysticism===\nSome Rodnovers believe that Slavic people constitute a race whose origin is distinct from that of other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to them, Slavs are the directest descendants of ancient [[Aryans]], whom they equate with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} Some Rodnovers espouse esoteric teachings which hold that these Aryans have spiritual origins linked to astral patterns of the north [[celestial pole]] (cf. [[circumpolar stars]]), around the [[pole star]], such as the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], or otherwise to the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] constellation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to further teachings the Aryans originally dwelt at the geographic [[North Pole]], where they lived until the weather changed and they moved southwards.{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=187|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=292}}\n\nOther Rodnovers emphasise that Aryans germinated in Russia's southern steppes.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} In claiming an Aryan ancestry, Slavic Native Faith practitioners can legitimise their cultural borrowing from other ethno-cultural groups who they claim are also Aryan descendants, such as the Germanic peoples or those of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=103}} Another belief held by some Rodnovers is that many ancient societies\u2014including those of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Hittites]], [[Sumer]]ians, and [[Etruscans]]\u2014were created by Slavs, but that this has been concealed by Western scholars eager to deny the Slavic peoples knowledge of their true history.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}}\n\n===Slavic civilisation in Rodnover eschatology and political project===\nSome Russian Rodnovers believe that Russia has a messianic role to play in human history and [[eschatology]]; Russia would be destined to be the final battleground between good and evil or the centre of post-apocalyptic civilisation which will survive the demise of the Western world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} At this point\u2014they believe\u2014the entire Russian nation will embrace Rodnovery.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=29}} The Russian Rodnover leader Aleksandr Asov believes that the ''Book of Veles'' will be the \"geopolitical weapon of the next millennium\" through which an imperial, Eurasian Russia will take over the spiritual and political leadership of the world from the degenerated West.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} Other Rodnovers believe that the new spiritual geopolitical centre will be Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=15}}\n\nIn 2006, a conference of the European New Right was held in Moscow under the title \"The Future of the White World\", with participants including Rodnover leaders such as Ukraine's Halyna Lozko and Russia's Pavel Tulaev.

The scholar Kaarina Aitamurto has defined Rodnovers' applied political systems as forms of '''grassroots democracy''', or as a '''''samoderzhavie''''' (\"people ruling themselves\") system, based on the ancient Slavic model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly) of the elders, similar to ancient [[Greek democracy]]. They generally propose a political system in which power is entrusted to assemblies of consensually-acknowledged wise men, or to a single wise individual.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20135}}\n\nOn the level of [[geopolitics]], to the \"unipolarity\", the \"unipolar\" world, created by the [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|mono-ideologies]] (the [[Abrahamic religions]] and their other ideological products) and led by the [[United States|United States of America]]-dominated West, the Rodnovers oppose the idea of '''\"multipolarity\"''', of a world of many power centres, well represented by the \"Russian Way\". In their view, while the unipolar world is characterised by the [[materialism]] and selfish [[utilitarianism]] of the West, the multipolar world represented by Russia is characterised by [[spirituality]], [[ecology]], [[humanism]] and true equality. The idea of multipolarity is popular among Russian intellectuals, and among Rodnovers it was first formally enunciated in the ''Russian Pagan Manifesto'', published in 1997 by four Russian Rodnover leaders.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=114}}\n\nRodnovery typically gives preeminence to [[individual and group rights|the rights of the collectivity over the rights of the individual]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} The scholar Robert A. Saunders finds that Rodnover ideas are very close to those of [[Eurasianism]], the current leading ideology of the Russian state.{{sfn|Saunders|2019|p=566}} According to [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor Shnirelman]] there is a loose boundary between explicitly political and less political Rodnovers, especially within Russian Rodnovery.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}}\n\n==Origins of the Slavs==\n{{Further|Historical Slavic religion}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate. Wood green represents East Slavic languages, pale green represents West Slavic languages, and sea green represents South Slavic languages.]]\nThe notion that modern Rodnovery is closely tied to the historical religion of the Slavs is a very strong one among practitioners.{{sfn|Simpson|Filip|2013|p=39}} There is no evidence that the [[early Slavs]], a branch of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], ever conceived of themselves as a unified ethno-cultural group.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005b|1p=211|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2017|2p=144}} There is an academic consensus that the [[Proto-Slavic]] language developed from about the second half of the first millennium BCE in an area of Central and Eastern Europe bordered by the [[Dnieper]] basin to the east, the [[Vistula]] basin to the west, the Carpathian Mountains to the south, and the forests beyond the [[Pripet]] basin to the north.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}}\n\nOver the course of several centuries, Slavic populations migrated in northern, eastern, and south-western directions.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}} In doing so, they branched out into three sub-linguistic families: the [[East Slavs]] ([[Ukrainians]], [[Belarussians]], [[Russians]]), the [[West Slavs]] ([[Poles]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]]), and the [[South Slavs]] ([[Slovenes]], [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], and [[Bulgarians]]).{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}} The belief systems of these Slavic communities had many affinities with those of neighbouring linguistic populations, such as the [[Baltic languages|Balts]], [[Thracian language|Thracians]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranians]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=211}} [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] studied the origin of ancient Slavic themes in the common substratum represented by [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and what [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] studied as the \"[[trifunctional hypothesis]]\". [[Marija Gimbutas]], instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. [[Boris Rybakov]] emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}}\n\n==Political stances and ideas==\n===The grassroots democratic system of the ''veche''===\n[[File:Prono (Montfaucon 1722).jpg|thumb|[[Perun]] (\"Thunder\"), spelled \"Prono\", in an illustration from the ''L'Antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'', Montfaucon, France, 1722.]]\nMany Russian Rodnover groups are strongly [[criticism of democracy|critical of democracy]], modern [[liberal democracy]], which they see as a degenerate form of government that leads to \"cosmopolitan chaos\". According to Shnirelman they favour instead political models of a centralised state led by a strong leader.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012}} Aitamurto, otherwise, characterises the political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \"[[thing (assembly)|thing]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20133}} Nineteenth- and twentieth-century intellectuals often interpreted the ''veche'' as an anti-hierarchic and democratic model, while later Soviet Marxist tended to identify it as \"pre-capitalist democracy\". The term already had ethnic and national connotations, which were underlined by nineteenth-century [[Slavophilia|Slavophiles]], and nationalist circles in the last decades of the Soviet Union and from the 1990s onwards.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=3}}\n\nMany Rodnover groups call their organisational structure ''veche''. Aitamurto finds that it proves to be useful in what she terms as Rodnvery's \"democratic criticism of democracy\" (of liberal democracy). According to her, the ''veche'' as interpreted by Rodnovers represents a vernacular form of governance similar to ancient [[Greek democracy]]. According to the view shared by many Rodnovers, while liberal democracy ends up in chaos because it is driven by the decisions of the masses, who are not wise; the ''veche'' represents a form of \"consensual decision-making\" of assemblies of wise elders, and power is exercised by wise rulers. [[Ynglists]] call this model ''samoderzhavie'', \"people ruling themselves\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=4\u20135}} Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \"outer\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \"inner\" freedom of the mind; in Rodnovers' view, Western liberal democracy is \"destined to execute the primitive desires of the masses or to work as a tool in the hands of a ruthless elite\", being therefore a mean-spirited \"rule of demons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=6-7}} Aitamurto also describes many Rodnovers' political philosophy as elitism, in which not everyone is reputed as having the same decision ability; the most conservative Rodnovers espouse the ideal that \"the opinion of a prostitute cannot have the same weight as the opinion of a professor\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=5}}\n\nIn these ideas of grassroots democracy which comes to fruition in a wise governance, Aitamurto sees an incarnation of the traditional Russian challenge of religious structures and alienated governance\u2014such as autocratic monarchy and totalitarian communism\u2014for achieving a personal relationship with the sacred, which is at the same time a demand of social solidarity and responsibility. She presents the interpretation of the myth of [[Perun]] who slashes the snake guilty of theft, provided by Russian [[volkhv]] Velimir, as symbolising the ideal relationship and collaboration between the ruler and the people, with the ruler serving the people who have chosen him by acting as an authority who provides them with order, and in turn is respected by the people with loyalty for his service.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=5\u20136}} Some Rodnovers interpret the ''veche'' in ethnic terms, thus as a form of \"ethnic democracy\", in the wake of similar concepts found in the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' of [[Alain de Benoist]] (European New Right).{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005b|1p=235|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2008|2p=6}}\n\n===Ethnic nationalism===\nThe scholar Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is fundamentally concerned with ethnic identity.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} This easily develops into forms of [[nationalism]],{{sfn|\u010crni\u010d|2013|p=189}} and has usually been characterised as [[ethnic nationalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=195|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\", that they \"have\u2014or their heritage has\u2014some superior qualities\", and that \"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to Shnirelman, ethnic nationalist and racist views are present even in those Rodnovers who do not identify as politically engaged.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}} He also noted that the movement is \"obsessed with the idea of origin\",{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=64}} and most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n====Attitudes towards race-mixing====\nIn its founding statement from 1998, the Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers led by the Ukrainian Rodnover leader [[Halyna Lozko]] declared that many of the world's problems stem from the \"mixing of ethnic cultures\", something which it claims has resulted in the \"ruination of the ethnosphere\", which they regard as an integral part of the Earth's [[biosphere]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=229}} For instance, the [[volkhv]] Dobroslav\u2014who holds a position of high respect within Russia's Rodnover community\u2014calls for a \"Russian national socialism\" and \"Pagan socialism\", entailing \"harmony with nature, a national sovereignty and a just social order\".{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2000|1p=18|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=66}}\n\nLev Sylenko, founder of the Ukrainian branch of Rodnovery known as the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]], taught that humanity was naturally divided up into distinct ethno-cultural groups, each with its own life cycle, religiosity, language, and customs, all of which had to spiritually progress in their own way.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|pp=225\u2013226}} Many Ukrainian Rodnovers emphasise a need for ethnic purity and oppose what they regard as \"culturally destructive\" phenomena such as [[cosmopolitanism]], [[liberalism]], and [[globalisation]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=223}} as well as [[Americanisation]] and [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}}\n\nEthnic purity is a central emphasis of groups like the [[Ynglist Church]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=206}} which abhors [[miscegenation]] as unhealthy, and abhors as well what are perceived as perverted sexual behaviours and the consumption of alcohol and drugs. According to the Ynglist Church, all of these are evil influences which come from the degenerating West and threaten Russia. In order to counterweigh them, the Ynglist Church promotes policies such as the \"creation of beneficial descendants\" (''sozidanie blagodetel'nogo potomstva'').{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Various Rodnovers have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n====Proposals for the creation of ethno-states in Russia====\nThere are Russian Rodnovers who promote the common views of Russian nationalism: some seek an imperialist policy that would expand Russia's territory across Europe and Asia, while others seek to reduce the area controlled by the Russian Federation to only those areas with an ethnic Russian majority.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} The place of nationalism, and of ethnic Russians' relationship to other ethnic groups inhabiting the Russian Federation, has been a key issue of discussion among Russian Rodnovers.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} Some express xenophobic views and encourage the removal of those regarded as \"aliens\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\nFor these Rodnovers, ethnic minorities are viewed as the cause of social justice in Russia.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} According to Shnirelman, given that around 20% of the Russian Federation is not ethnically Russian, the ideas of ethnic homogeneity embraced by many Russian Rodnovers could only be achieved through [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Aitamurto notes that the territorial release of several of the majority non-Russian [[republics of Russia]] and [[autonomous okrugs of Russia]] would result in the same reduction of ethnic minorities in Russia without any need for violence whatsoever, which is the approach called for by peaceful Russian Rodnovers.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\n===Antisemitic stances===\nVarious Russian practitioners are openly [[antisemitic]],{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=284}} and express conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control Russia's economic and political elite.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} For example, the Ukrainian leader Halyna Lozko produced a prayer manual titled ''Pravoslav'' in which \"Don't get involved with Jews!\" was listed as the last of ten \"Pagan commandments\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=234}} Extreme right-wing nationalists are also present within the Polish Rodnover community.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nShnirelman observed that Russian practitioners usually deny or downplay the racist and Nazi elements within their community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=62}} There are various Rodnover groups in Russia which are openly inspired by [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=296}} Among those groups that are ideologically akin to [[Neo-Nazism]], the term \"Nazi\" is rarely embraced, in part due to the prominent role that the Soviet Union played in the defeat of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=197}} Some Rodnovers claim that those who adopt such extreme right-wing perspectives are not true Rodnovers because their interests in the movement are primarily political rather than religious.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=62}} According to the scholars Hilary Pilkington and Anton Popov, [[Cossack]] Rodnovers generally eschew Nazism and racial interpretations of the concept of \"[[Aryan]]\".{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=273}}\n\n===De-politicisation movements===\nTrends of de-politicisation of the Russian Rodnover community have been influenced by the introduction of anti-extremist legislation,{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1p=62|2a1=Shizhenskii|2a2=Aitamurto|2y=2017|2p=114}} and the lack of any significant political opposition to the [[United Russia]] government of [[Vladimir Putin]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} Simpson noted that in Poland, there has been an increasing trend to separate the religion from explicitly political activities and ideas during the 2010s.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=71}} The Russian Circle of Pagan Tradition recognises Russia as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural state, and has developed links with other religious communities in the country, such as practitioners of [[Mari Native Faith]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} Members of the Circle of Pagan Tradition prefer to characterise themselves as \"patriots\" rather than \"nationalists\" and seek to avoid any association with the idea of a \"Russia for the Russians\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}} Aitarmurto suggested that the different wings of the Rodnover movement \"attract different kinds of people approaching Paganism from quite diverging points of departure\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=205}} She and Shizhenskii suggested that expressions of ultra-nationalism were considered socially unacceptable at one of the largest Rodnover event in Russia, the Kupala festival outside [[Maloyaroslavets]].{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=129}}\n\n===Influence on already-extant political formations and incidents===\nRodnover ideas and symbols have also been adopted by many Russian nationalists\u2014including in the Russian skinhead movement{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1p=67|2a1=Shizhenskii|2a2=Aitamurto|2y=2017|2pp=115\u2013116}}\u2014not all of whom embrace Rodnovery as a religion.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=156}} Some of these far-right groups merge Rodnover elements with others adopted from Germanic Heathenry and from Russian Orthodox Christianity.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=68}} [[Ynglism]] is characterised by Aitamurto as less politically goal-oriented than other Rodnover movements.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}} However, the Russian scholar of religion Vladimir B. Yashin of the Department of Theology and World Cultures of [[Omsk State University]] wrote in 2001 that the church has close ties with the regional branch of the far-right [[Russian National Unity]] of [[Alexander Barkashov]], whose members provide security and order during the mass gatherings of the Ynglists.<ref name=Maltsev>{{cite article |last=Maltsev |first=V.

Russian interpreters, however, locate this event much further east and north. The ''Book'' contains hymns and prayers, sermons, mythological, theological and political tracts, and historical narrative. It tells the wandering, over about one thousand and five hundred years of the ancestors of the [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], identified as the ''Oryans'' (the book's version of the word \"[[Aryan]]\"), between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], with modern Ukraine ultimately becoming their main homeland. Ivakhiv says that this territorial expansiveness is the main issue that makes historians wary of the ''Book''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} Aitamurto described the work as a \"Romantic description\" of a \"Pagan Golden Age\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nThe fact that many scholars outspokenly reject the ''Book'' as a modern, twentieth-century composition has added to the allure that the text has for many Slavic Native Faith practitioners. According to them, such criticism is an attempt to \"suppress knowledge\" carried forward either by Soviet-style [[scientism]] or by \"Judaic cosmopolitan\" forces. A number of Ukrainian scholars defend the truthfulness of the ''Book'', including literary historian Borys Yatsenko, archaeologist Yuri Shylov, and writers Valery Shevchuk, Serhy Plachynda, Ivan Bilyk, and Yuri Kanyhin. These scholars claim that criticism of the ''Book'' primarily comes from Russians interested in promoting a Russocentric view of history which sets the origin of all [[East Slavs]] in the north, while the ''Book'' shows that southern Rus' civilisation is much older, and nearer to Ukrainians themselves, [[West Slavs]], [[South Slavs]] and the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|eastern Indo-European]] composers of the [[Vedas]], than to Russians.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} For many Ukrainian Rodnovers, the ''Book'' provides them with a cosmology, ethical system, and ritual practices that they can follow, and confirms their belief that the ancient Ukrainians had a literate and advanced civilisation prior to the arrival of Christianity.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005b|p=219}} Other modern literary works that have influenced the movement, albeit on a smaller scale, include ''The Songs of the Bird Gamayon'', ''Koliada's Book of Stars'', ''The Song of the Victory on the Jewish Khazaria of Sviatoslav the Brave'' or ''The Rigveda of Kiev''.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=291}}\n\n===Aryans and polar mysticism===\nSome Rodnovers believe that Slavic people constitute a race whose origin is distinct from that of other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to them, Slavs are the directest descendants of ancient [[Aryans]], whom they equate with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} Some Rodnovers espouse esoteric teachings which hold that these Aryans have spiritual origins linked to astral patterns of the north [[celestial pole]] (cf. [[circumpolar stars]]), around the [[pole star]], such as the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], or otherwise to the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] constellation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to further teachings the Aryans originally dwelt at the geographic [[North Pole]], where they lived until the weather changed and they moved southwards.{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=187|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=292}}\n\nOther Rodnovers emphasise that Aryans germinated in Russia's southern steppes.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} In claiming an Aryan ancestry, Slavic Native Faith practitioners can legitimise their cultural borrowing from other ethno-cultural groups who they claim are also Aryan descendants, such as the Germanic peoples or those of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=103}} Another belief held by some Rodnovers is that many ancient societies\u2014including those of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Hittites]], [[Sumer]]ians, and [[Etruscans]]\u2014were created by Slavs, but that this has been concealed by Western scholars eager to deny the Slavic peoples knowledge of their true history.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}}\n\n===Slavic civilisation in Rodnover eschatology and political project===\nSome Russian Rodnovers believe that Russia has a messianic role to play in human history and [[eschatology]]; Russia would be destined to be the final battleground between good and evil or the centre of post-apocalyptic civilisation which will survive the demise of the Western world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} At this point\u2014they believe\u2014the entire Russian nation will embrace Rodnovery.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=29}} The Russian Rodnover leader Aleksandr Asov believes that the ''Book of Veles'' will be the \"geopolitical weapon of the next millennium\" through which an imperial, Eurasian Russia will take over the spiritual and political leadership of the world from the degenerated West.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} Other Rodnovers believe that the new spiritual geopolitical centre will be Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=15}}\n\nIn 2006, a conference of the European New Right was held in Moscow under the title \"The Future of the White World\", with participants including Rodnover leaders such as Ukraine's Halyna Lozko and Russia's Pavel Tulaev.
