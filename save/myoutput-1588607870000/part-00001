The students are also required to attend 8 units of physical education class, and a choice from ROTC, civic welfare service training (CWTS) and literacy training service (LTS).\n\nBased on the strength of its academic programs and quality of services, HAU has been given an Autonomous Status by the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd), as well as Accredited Status by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) and as the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE).\n\nThe university is home to eight undergraduate colleges, with the School of Business and Accountancy as the oldest.
