It is a non-enveloped virus with a diameter of approximately 35\u201340 nm, icosahedral symmetry, and a linear positive-sense RNA genome of 6.4\u20138.5 kb. RHDV causes a generalized infection in rabbits that is characterized by massive liver necrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rapid death. Division into serotypes has been defined by a lack of cross-neutralization using specific antisera.<ref name=ICTV2020>{{cite web |title=Caliciviridae |url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/positive-sense-rna-viruses/w/caliciviridae#Virion |website=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) |accessdate=4 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=PJ |last2=Kitchen |first2=A |last3=Holmes |first3=EC |title=Origin and Phylodynamics of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus |journal=Journal of Virology |date=2009 |volume=83 |issue=23 |pages=12129\u201312138 |doi=10.1128/JVI.01523-09|}}</ref> all of which are highly pathogenic.

RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |display-authors=3 |last1=Liu |first1=SJ |last2=Xue |first2=HP |last3=Pu |first3=BQ |last4=Qian |first4=NH |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named ''rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2'' (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology and transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Surviving rabbits may be contagious for up to 2 months.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=Kerr2013>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=PJ |last2=Donnelly |first2=TM |title=Viral Infections of Rabbits |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice |date=May 2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=437\u2013468 |doi=10.1016/j.cvex.2013.02.002}}</ref> Predators and scavengers can also spread the virus by shedding it in their feces.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nRHD outbreaks tend to be seasonal in wild rabbit populations, where most adults have survived infection and are immune. As young kits grow up and stop nursing, they no longer receive the antibodies provided in their mother's milk and become susceptible to infection. Thus RHD [[epizootic]]s occur more often during the rabbits' breeding season.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nBoth viral strains of RHDV replicate in the liver, causing hepatic [[necrosis]] and liver failure. Liver failure can in turn lead to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and [[nephrosis]].<ref name=Kerr2013 /> Bleeding may occur as clotting factors and platelets are used up.\n\n== Clinical signs ==\n[[File:Rabbit with jaundice (eye).jpg|thumb|European rabbit with yellowing of [[conjunctiva]] and [[sclera]] due to jaundice]]\n[[File:Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.jpg|thumb|European rabbit with [[epistaxis]]]]\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease causes hepatitis. The incubation period for RHDVa is one to two days, and for RHDV-2 three to five days. Rabbits infected with RHDV-2 are more likely to show subacute or chronic signs than are those infected with RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> In rabbitries, an epidemic with high mortality rates in adult and subadult rabbits is typical.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> If the outbreak is caused by RHDV-2 than deaths will also occur in young rabbits.  \n\nRHD can vary in how quickly or slowly clinical signs occur. In peracute cases rabbits are usually found dead with no premonitory symptoms.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Rabbits may be observed grazing normally immediately before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nIn acute cases rabbits are inactive and reluctant to move. They may develop a fever of up to 42\u00b0 C (107.6\u00b0 F) and have increased heart and respiratory rates. Bloody discharge from the nose, mouth, or vulva is common, as is blood in the feces or urine. Lateral recumbency, coma, and convulsions may be observed before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Rabbits with the acute form generally die within 12 to 36 hours from the onset of fever.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> \n\nSubacute to chronic RHD has a more protracted clinical course, and is more commonly noted with RHDV-2 infections. Clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, and [[jaundice]]. Gastrointestinal dilation, cardiac [[arrhythmia]]s, [[heart murmur]]s, and neurologic abnormalities can also occur.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Death, if it occurs, usually happens 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, and is due to liver failure.<ref name=Rocchi2018 />\n\nNot all rabbits exposed to RHDVa or RHDV-2 become overtly ill. A small proportion of infected rabbits clear the virus without developing signs of disease.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> [[Asymptomatic carriers]] also occur, and can continue to shed virus for months, thereby infecting other animals. Surviving rabbits develop a strong immunity to the specific viral variant they were infected with.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nA presumptive diagnosis of RHD can often be made based on clinical presentation, infection pattern within a population, and post-mortem lesions. Definitive diagnosis requires detection of the virus. As most caliciviruses cannot be grown in cell culture, molecular and serologic methods of viral detection are often used.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nComplete blood counts from rabbits with RHD often show low levels of white blood cells and platelets, and chemistry panels show elevated liver enzymes. Evidence of liver failure may also be present, including increased bile acids and bilirubin, and decreased glucose and cholesterol. Prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times are typical. Urinalysis can show bilirubinuria, proteinuria, and high urinary GGT.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  \n\nThe classic postmortem lesion seen in rabbits with RHD is extensive hepatic necrosis and jaundice. There may also be multifocal hemorrhages, splenomegaly, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or edema, and myocardial necrosis.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nA variety of molecular tests can be used to identify RHD viruses. [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) tests are a commonly used and accurate testing modality for viruses. Other tests used include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]), [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], [[immunostaining]], [[Western blot]], and [[in situ hybridization]].<ref name=Gleeson2020 />   The tissue of choice for molecular testing is fresh or frozen liver, as it usually contains the largest amount of virus, but if this is not available spleen and serum can also be used. It is important to identify the strain of RHDV so that vaccination protocols can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n== Prevention and control ==\n===Vaccines===\nThere are a number of vaccines available against RHD that are sold in countries where the disease is endemic. All of these vaccines provide 12 months of protection against RHD viruses.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up. Ten years on, rabbit populations (in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] in particular) are beginning to reach near pre-plague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to pre RCD levels.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Munro|editor1-first=Robert K. |editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Richard T. |title=Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease: Issues in Assessment for biological control |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau of Resource Sciences |location=Canberra |isbn=9780644335126}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 1080 drops in MacKenzie Basin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2441711/Mackenzie-1080-drop-plan |last=Williams |first=D |date=26 May 2009 |newspaper= The Press |accessdate = 2009-06-14}}</ref>\n\nResistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of [[1080 usage in New Zealand|Compound 1080 (Sodium fluoroacetate)]].

RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |display-authors=3 |last1=Liu |first1=SJ |last2=Xue |first2=HP |last3=Pu |first3=BQ |last4=Qian |first4=NH |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named ''rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2'' (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology and transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Surviving rabbits may be contagious for up to 2 months.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=Kerr2013>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=PJ |last2=Donnelly |first2=TM |title=Viral Infections of Rabbits |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice |date=May 2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=437\u2013468 |doi=10.1016/j.cvex.2013.02.002}}</ref> Predators and scavengers can also spread the virus by shedding it in their feces.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nRHD outbreaks tend to be seasonal in wild rabbit populations, where most adults have survived infection and are immune. As young kits grow up and stop nursing, they no longer receive the antibodies provided in their mother's milk and become susceptible to infection. Thus RHD [[epizootic]]s occur more often during the rabbits' breeding season.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nBoth viral strains of RHDV replicate in the liver, causing hepatic [[necrosis]] and liver failure. Liver failure can in turn lead to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and [[nephrosis]].<ref name=Kerr2013 /> Bleeding may occur as clotting factors and platelets are used up.\n\n== Clinical signs ==\n[[File:Rabbit with jaundice (eye).jpg|thumb|European rabbit with yellowing of [[conjunctiva]] and [[sclera]] due to jaundice]]\n[[File:Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.jpg|thumb|European rabbit with [[epistaxis]]]]\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease causes hepatitis. The incubation period for RHDVa is one to two days, and for RHDV-2 three to five days. Rabbits infected with RHDV-2 are more likely to show subacute or chronic signs than are those infected with RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> In rabbitries, an epidemic with high mortality rates in adult and subadult rabbits is typical.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> If the outbreak is caused by RHDV-2 than deaths will also occur in young rabbits.  \n\nRHD can vary in how quickly or slowly clinical signs occur. In peracute cases rabbits are usually found dead with no premonitory symptoms.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Rabbits may be observed grazing normally immediately before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nIn acute cases rabbits are inactive and reluctant to move. They may develop a fever of up to 42\u00b0 C (107.6\u00b0 F) and have increased heart and respiratory rates. Bloody discharge from the nose, mouth, or vulva is common, as is blood in the feces or urine. Lateral recumbency, coma, and convulsions may be observed before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Rabbits with the acute form generally die within 12 to 36 hours from the onset of fever.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> \n\nSubacute to chronic RHD has a more protracted clinical course, and is more commonly noted with RHDV-2 infections. Clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, and [[jaundice]]. Gastrointestinal dilation, cardiac [[arrhythmia]]s, [[heart murmur]]s, and neurologic abnormalities can also occur.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Death, if it occurs, usually happens 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, and is due to liver failure.<ref name=Rocchi2018 />\n\nNot all rabbits exposed to RHDVa or RHDV-2 become overtly ill. A small proportion of infected rabbits clear the virus without developing signs of disease.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> [[Asymptomatic carriers]] also occur, and can continue to shed virus for months, thereby infecting other animals. Surviving rabbits develop a strong immunity to the specific viral variant they were infected with.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nA presumptive diagnosis of RHD can often be made based on clinical presentation, infection pattern within a population, and post-mortem lesions. Definitive diagnosis requires detection of the virus. As most caliciviruses cannot be grown in cell culture, molecular and serologic methods of viral detection are often used.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nComplete blood counts from rabbits with RHD often show low levels of white blood cells and platelets, and chemistry panels show elevated liver enzymes. Evidence of liver failure may also be present, including increased bile acids and bilirubin, and decreased glucose and cholesterol. Prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times are typical. Urinalysis can show bilirubinuria, proteinuria, and high urinary GGT.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  \n\nThe classic postmortem lesion seen in rabbits with RHD is extensive hepatic necrosis and jaundice. There may also be multifocal hemorrhages, splenomegaly, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or edema, and myocardial necrosis.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nA variety of molecular tests can be used to identify RHD viruses. [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) tests are a commonly used and accurate testing modality for viruses. Other tests used include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]), [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], [[immunostaining]], [[Western blot]], and [[in situ hybridization]].<ref name=Gleeson2020 />   The tissue of choice for molecular testing is fresh or frozen liver, as it usually contains the largest amount of virus, but if this is not available spleen and serum can also be used. It is important to identify the strain of RHDV so that vaccination protocols can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n== Prevention and control ==\n===Vaccines===\nThere are a number of vaccines available against RHD that are sold in countries where the disease is endemic.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up.
