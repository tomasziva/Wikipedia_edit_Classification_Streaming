The seed [[Conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} long and mature in 18\u201320 months, though they typically remain green and closed for as long as 20 years. Each cone has 30\u201350 spirally arranged scales, with several seeds on each scale, giving an average of 230 seeds per cone. Seeds are dark brown, {{convert|4|-|5|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long, and {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} broad, with a {{convert|1|mm|adj=on|sp=us|sigfig=1}} wide, yellow-brown wing along each side. Some seeds shed when the cone scales shrink during hot weather in late summer, but most are liberated by insect damage or when the cone dries from the heat of fire. Young trees start to bear cones after 12 years.\n\nTrees may produce sprouts from their stumps subsequent to injury, until about 20 years old; however, shoots do not form on the stumps of mature trees as they do on coast redwoods. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from their [[Trunk (botany)|bole]]s when branches are lost to fire or breakage.\n\nA large tree may have as many as 11,000 cones. Cone production is greatest in the upper portion of the canopy. A mature giant sequoia disperses an estimated 300\u2013400 thousand seeds annually. The winged seeds may fly as far as {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the parent tree.\n\nLower branches die readily from being shaded, but trees younger than 100 years retain most of their dead branches. Trunks of mature trees in groves are generally free of branches to a height of {{convert|20|-|50|m|abbr=on|-1}}, but solitary trees retain lower branches.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Biology==\nBecause of its size, the tree has been studied for its water pull. Water from the roots can be pushed up only a few meters by [[osmotic pressure]] but can reach extreme heights by using a system of branching [[capillarity]] (capillary action) in the tree's [[xylem]] (the water tubules) and sub-pressure from evaporating water at the leaves.<ref>[http://www.cropsreview.com/transpiration-pull.html water pull] at Cropsview  (an agriculture science magazine) website</ref> Sequoias supplement water from the soil with fog, taken up through [[air root]]s, at heights to where the root water cannot be pulled.<ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/tree-grow.htm Studies on tree height limits, and the Sequoia in particular]</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:A014, Sequoia National Park, California, USA, 1998.jpg|thumb|The [[Generals Highway]] passes between giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park]]\nThe natural distribution of giant sequoias is restricted to a limited area of the western [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], [[California]]. They occur in scattered groves, with a total of 68 groves (see [[list of sequoia groves]] for a full inventory), comprising a total area of only {{convert|144.16|km2|acre|abbr=on}}. Nowhere does it grow in pure stands, although in a few small areas, stands do approach a pure condition. The northern two-thirds of its range, from the [[American River]] in [[Placer County, California|Placer County]] southward to the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]], has only eight disjunct groves. The remaining southern groves are concentrated between the Kings River and the Deer Creek Grove in southern [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]]. Groves range in size from {{convert|12.4|km2|acre|abbr=on}} with 20,000 mature trees, to small groves with only six living trees. Many are protected in [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Kings Canyon National Park]]s and [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]].\n\nThe giant sequoia is usually found in a humid climate characterized by dry summers and [[snow]]y winters. Most giant sequoia groves are on granitic-based residual and [[alluvium|alluvial]] soils. The elevation of the giant sequoia groves generally ranges from {{convert|1400|-|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the north, to {{convert|1700|-|2150|m|ft}} to the south. Giant sequoias generally occur on the south-facing sides of northern mountains, and on the northern faces of more southerly slopes.\n\nHigh levels of reproduction are not necessary to maintain the present population levels. Few groves, however, have sufficient young trees to maintain the present density of mature giant sequoias for the future. The majority of giant sequoia groves are currently undergoing a gradual decline in density since European settlement.\n\n===Historic range===\nWhile the present day distribution of this species is limited to a small area of California, it was once much more widely distributed in prehistoric times, and was a reasonably common species in North American and Eurasian coniferous forests until its range was greatly reduced by the last [[ice age]]. Older fossil specimens reliably identified as giant sequoia have been found in [[Cretaceous]] era sediments from a number of sites in North America and Europe, and even as far afield as New Zealand<ref>James E Eckenwalder.

The giant sequoias were rediscovered in 2008 by botanist Rudolf Schmid and his daughter Mena Schmidt while hiking on Black Mountain Trail through Hall Canyon. [[Black Mountain Grove]] is home to over 150 giant sequoias, some of which stand over {{convert|6.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Nearby [[Lake Fulmor Grove]] is home to seven giant sequoias, the largest of which is {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, and is physically separate from Black Mountain Grove. The two groves are located approximately {{convert|175|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the southernmost naturally occurring giant sequoia grove, [[Deer Creek Grove]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Rudolf|last2=Mena|first2=Schmidt|date=2012|title=NATURALIZATION OF SEQUOIADENDRON GIGANTEUM (CUPRESSACEAE) IN MONTANE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/112d/a2b883b408d4050c91f49ea072a3d1fbe0c7.pdf|journal=Aliso: A Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=19-32|via=Semantic Scholar}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Rudolf|last2=Mena|first2=Schmidt|date=2013|title=Sequoiadendron giganteum (Cupressaceae) at Lake Fulmor, Riverside County, California.|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&context=aliso|journal=Aliso: A Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology|volume=30|issue=2|pages=103-107|via=Scholarship @ Claremont}}</ref>\n\nIt was later discovered that the [[United States Forest Service]] had planted giant sequoias across Southern California. However, the giant sequoias of [[Black Mountain Grove (Southern California)|Black Mountain Grove]] and nearby [[Lake Fulmor Grove]] are the only ones known to be reproducing and propagating free of human intervention. The conditions of the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] mimic those of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], allowing the trees to naturally propagate throughout the canyon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/these-sequoia-trees-are-thriving-175-miles-south-of-the-1579409426|title=These Sequoia Trees Are Thriving 175 Miles South of Their Natural Range|website=Gizmodo|date=21 May 2014|first=Nathan|last=Masters|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Sequoia trees.JPG|thumb|Two giant sequoias, [[Sequoia National Park]]. The right-hand tree bears a large fire scar at its base; fires do not typically kill the trees but do remove competing thin-barked species, and aid giant sequoia regeneration.]]\n\nGiant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire.<ref>National Geographic Magazine December 2012</ref> The giant sequoias are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle [[humus]] in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic [[wildfire]] to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. When fully grown, these trees typically require large amounts of water and are therefore often concentrated near streams.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Squirrels, chipmunks, finches and sparrows consume the freshly sprouted seedlings, preventing their growth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Peattie |first=Donald Culross |authorlink=Donald C. Peattie |title=A Natural History of Western Trees |year=1953 |publisher=[[Bonanza Books]] |location=New York |p=11}}</ref>\n\nFires also bring hot air high into the canopy via [[convection]], which in turn dries and opens the cones. The subsequent release of large quantities of seeds coincides with the optimal postfire [[seedbed]] conditions. Loose ground ash may also act as a cover to protect the fallen seeds from [[ultraviolet radiation]] damage.\nDue to fire suppression efforts and livestock grazing during the early and mid-20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires leads to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth of fire-sensitive [[white fir]], which increases the risk of more intense fires that can use the firs as ladders to threaten mature giant sequoia crowns. Natural fires may also be important in keeping [[carpenter ant]]s in check.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephens |first1=Scott |last2=Finney |first2=Mark |title=Prescribed fire mortality of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer tree species: effects of crown damage and forest floor combustion |journal=Forest Ecology and Management |date=2002 |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=261\u2013271 |doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00521-7}}</ref>\nIn 1970, the [[National Park Service]] began controlled burns of its groves to correct these problems. Current policies also allow natural fires to burn. One of these untamed burns severely damaged the second-largest tree in the world, the [[Washington tree]], in September 2003, 45 days after the fire started. This damage made it unable to withstand the snowstorm of January 2005, leading to the collapse of over half the trunk.\n\nIn addition to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant of the two is a [[longhorn beetle]] (''[[Phymatodes nitidus]]'') that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. Reduction of the vascular water supply to the cone scales allows the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open over the next several months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully open them. The other agent is the [[Douglas squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus douglasi'') that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. The squirrels are active year round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nps.gov/seki/naturescience/upload/hh_tt67.pdf|title=The Fire Ecology of Sequoia Regeneration|journal=Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference|volume=7|page=7|first1=RJ|last1=Hartesveldt|first2=HT|last2=Harvey|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Giant sequoia exhibitionism.jpg|thumb|Shortly after their discovery by Europeans, giant sequoias were subject to much exhibition]]\nThe giant sequoia was well known to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes living in its area. Native American names for the species include ''wawona'', ''toos-pung-ish'' and ''hea-mi-withic'', the latter two in the language of the Tule River Tribe.\n\nThe first reference to the giant sequoia by Europeans is in 1833, in the diary of the explorer J. K. Leonard; the reference does not mention any locality, but his route would have taken him through the [[Calaveras Big Trees State Park|Calaveras Grove]].<ref name=\"farquhar\">{{cite journal|last=Farquhar|first=Francis P.|title=Discovery of the Sierra Nevada|year=1925|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|volume=4|pages=3\u201358|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/exploration_of_the_sierra_nevada/|issue=1|doi=10.2307/25177743|jstor=25177743}}, Yosemite.ca.us</ref> This discovery was not publicized. The next European to see the species was John M. Wooster, who carved his initials in the bark of the 'Hercules' tree in the Calaveras Grove in 1850; again, this received no publicity.

Dowd of the Calaveras Grove in 1852, and this is commonly cited as the species' discovery.<ref name=\"farquhar\"/> The tree found by Dowd, christened the 'Discovery Tree', was felled in 1853.\n\nThe first scientific naming of the species was by [[John Lindley]] in December 1853, who named it ''Wellingtonia gigantea'', without realizing this was an invalid name under the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|botanical code]] as the name ''Wellingtonia'' had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant (''[[Wellingtonia arnottiana]]'' in the family [[Sabiaceae]]).

The name ''Washingtonia californica'' was also applied to it by Winslow in 1854, though this too is invalid, belonging to the [[Arecaceae|palm]] genus ''[[Washingtonia]]''.\n[[File:Closepintree.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Clothespin tree in the [[Mariposa Grove]], [[Yosemite National Park]]]]\nIn 1907, it was placed by [[Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze]] in the otherwise [[fossil]] genus ''[[Steinhauera]]'', but doubt as to whether the giant sequoia is related to the fossil originally so named makes this name invalid.\n\nThe nomenclatural oversights were finally corrected in 1939 by [[John T. Buchholz|J.

From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The [[Hume-Bennett Lumber Company]] was the last to harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title = Battle against Rough fire intensifies as blaze bears down on Hume Lake|url = http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article31640498.html|website = fresnobee|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}</ref> Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.\n\nPictures of the once majestic trees broken and abandoned in formerly pristine groves, and the thought of the giants put to such modest use, spurred the public outcry that caused most of the groves to be preserved as protected land. The public can visit an example of 1880s clear-cutting at [[Big Stump Grove]] near [[General Grant Grove]]. As late as the 1980s, some immature trees were logged in [[Sequoia National Forest]], publicity of which helped lead to the creation of [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe wood from immature trees is less brittle, with recent tests on young [[plantation]]-grown trees showing it similar to coast redwood wood in quality. This is resulting in some interest in cultivating giant sequoia as a very high-yielding timber crop tree, both in California and also in parts of western Europe, where it may grow more efficiently than coast redwoods. In the northwest [[United States]], some entrepreneurs have also begun growing giant sequoias for [[Christmas tree]]s. Besides these attempts at tree farming, the principal economic uses for giant sequoia today are [[tourism]] and [[horticulture]].\n\n==Cultivation==\nGiant sequoia is a very popular [[ornamental tree]] in many areas.

The seed [[Conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} long and mature in 18\u201320 months, though they typically remain green and closed for as long as 20 years. Each cone has 30\u201350 spirally arranged scales, with several seeds on each scale, giving an average of 230 seeds per cone. Seeds are dark brown, {{convert|4|-|5|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long, and {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} broad, with a {{convert|1|mm|adj=on|sp=us|sigfig=1}} wide, yellow-brown wing along each side. Some seeds shed when the cone scales shrink during hot weather in late summer, but most are liberated by insect damage or when the cone dries from the heat of fire. Young trees start to bear cones after 12 years.\n\nTrees may produce sprouts from their stumps subsequent to injury, until about 20 years old; however, shoots do not form on the stumps of mature trees as they do on coast redwoods. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from their [[Trunk (botany)|bole]]s when branches are lost to fire or breakage.\n\nA large tree may have as many as 11,000 cones. Cone production is greatest in the upper portion of the canopy. A mature giant sequoia disperses an estimated 300\u2013400 thousand seeds annually. The winged seeds may fly as far as {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the parent tree.\n\nLower branches die readily from being shaded, but trees younger than 100 years retain most of their dead branches.

Water from the roots can be pushed up only a few meters by [[osmotic pressure]] but can reach extreme heights by using a system of branching [[capillarity]] (capillary action) in the tree's [[xylem]] (the water tubules) and sub-pressure from evaporating water at the leaves.<ref>[http://www.cropsreview.com/transpiration-pull.html water pull] at Cropsview  (an agriculture science magazine) website</ref> Sequoias supplement water from the soil with fog, taken up through [[air root]]s, at heights to where the root water cannot be pulled.<ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/tree-grow.htm Studies on tree height limits, and the Sequoia in particular]</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:A014, Sequoia National Park, California, USA, 1998.jpg|thumb|The [[Generals Highway]] passes between giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park]]\nThe natural distribution of giant sequoias is restricted to a limited area of the western [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], [[California]]. They occur in scattered groves, with a total of 68 groves (see [[list of sequoia groves]] for a full inventory), comprising a total area of only {{convert|144.16|km2|acre|abbr=on}}. Nowhere does it grow in pure stands, although in a few small areas, stands do approach a pure condition. The northern two-thirds of its range, from the [[American River]] in [[Placer County, California|Placer County]] southward to the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]], has only eight disjunct groves. The remaining southern groves are concentrated between the Kings River and the Deer Creek Grove in southern [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]]. Groves range in size from {{convert|12.4|km2|acre|abbr=on}} with 20,000 mature trees, to small groves with only six living trees. Many are protected in [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Kings Canyon National Park]]s and [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]].\n\nThe giant sequoia is usually found in a humid climate characterized by dry summers and [[snow]]y winters. Most giant sequoia groves are on granitic-based residual and [[alluvium|alluvial]] soils. The elevation of the giant sequoia groves generally ranges from {{convert|1400|-|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the north, to {{convert|1700|-|2150|m|ft}} to the south. Giant sequoias generally occur on the south-facing sides of northern mountains, and on the northern faces of more southerly slopes.\n\nHigh levels of reproduction are not necessary to maintain the present population levels. Few groves, however, have sufficient young trees to maintain the present density of mature giant sequoias for the future. The majority of giant sequoia groves are currently undergoing a gradual decline in density since European settlement.\n\n===Historic range===\nWhile the present day distribution of this species is limited to a small area of California, it was once much more widely distributed in prehistoric times, and was a reasonably common species in North American and Eurasian coniferous forests until its range was greatly reduced by the last [[ice age]]. Older fossil specimens reliably identified as giant sequoia have been found in [[Cretaceous]] era sediments from a number of sites in North America and Europe, and even as far afield as New Zealand<ref>James E Eckenwalder.

The giant sequoias were rediscovered in 2008 by botanist Rudolf Schmid and his daughter Mena Schmidt while hiking on Black Mountain Trail through Hall Canyon. [[Black Mountain Grove]] is home to over 150 giant sequoias, some of which stand over {{convert|6.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Nearby [[Lake Fulmor Grove]] is home to seven giant sequoias, the largest of which is {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, and is physically separate from Black Mountain Grove. The two groves are located approximately {{convert|175|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the southernmost naturally occurring giant sequoia grove, [[Deer Creek Grove]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Rudolf|last2=Mena|first2=Schmidt|date=2012|title=NATURALIZATION OF SEQUOIADENDRON GIGANTEUM (CUPRESSACEAE) IN MONTANE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/112d/a2b883b408d4050c91f49ea072a3d1fbe0c7.pdf|journal=Aliso: A Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=19-32|via=Semantic Scholar}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Rudolf|last2=Mena|first2=Schmidt|date=2013|title=Sequoiadendron giganteum (Cupressaceae) at Lake Fulmor, Riverside County, California.|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&context=aliso|journal=Aliso: A Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology|volume=30|issue=2|pages=103-107|via=Scholarship @ Claremont}}</ref>\n\nIt was later discovered that the [[United States Forest Service]] had planted giant sequoias across Southern California. However, the giant sequoias of [[Black Mountain Grove (Southern California)|Black Mountain Grove]] and nearby [[Lake Fulmor Grove]] are the only ones known to be reproducing and propagating free of human intervention. The conditions of the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] mimic those of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], allowing the trees to naturally propagate throughout the canyon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/these-sequoia-trees-are-thriving-175-miles-south-of-the-1579409426|title=These Sequoia Trees Are Thriving 175 Miles South of Their Natural Range|website=Gizmodo|date=21 May 2014|first=Nathan|last=Masters|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Sequoia trees.JPG|thumb|Two giant sequoias, [[Sequoia National Park]]. The right-hand tree bears a large fire scar at its base; fires do not typically kill the trees but do remove competing thin-barked species, and aid giant sequoia regeneration.]]\n\nGiant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire.<ref>National Geographic Magazine December 2012</ref> The giant sequoias are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle [[humus]] in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic [[wildfire]] to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. When fully grown, these trees typically require large amounts of water and are therefore often concentrated near streams.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Squirrels, chipmunks, finches and sparrows consume the freshly sprouted seedlings, preventing their growth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Peattie |first=Donald Culross |authorlink=Donald C. Peattie |title=A Natural History of Western Trees |year=1953 |publisher=[[Bonanza Books]] |location=New York |p=11}}</ref>\n\nFires also bring hot air high into the canopy via [[convection]], which in turn dries and opens the cones. The subsequent release of large quantities of seeds coincides with the optimal postfire [[seedbed]] conditions. Loose ground ash may also act as a cover to protect the fallen seeds from [[ultraviolet radiation]] damage.\nDue to fire suppression efforts and livestock grazing during the early and mid-20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires leads to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth of fire-sensitive [[white fir]], which increases the risk of more intense fires that can use the firs as ladders to threaten mature giant sequoia crowns. Natural fires may also be important in keeping [[carpenter ant]]s in check.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephens |first1=Scott |last2=Finney |first2=Mark |title=Prescribed fire mortality of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer tree species: effects of crown damage and forest floor combustion |journal=Forest Ecology and Management |date=2002 |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=261\u2013271 |doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00521-7}}</ref>\nIn 1970, the [[National Park Service]] began controlled burns of its groves to correct these problems. Current policies also allow natural fires to burn. One of these untamed burns severely damaged the second-largest tree in the world, the [[Washington tree]], in September 2003, 45 days after the fire started. This damage made it unable to withstand the snowstorm of January 2005, leading to the collapse of over half the trunk.\n\nIn addition to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant of the two is a [[longhorn beetle]] (''[[Phymatodes nitidus]]'') that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. Reduction of the vascular water supply to the cone scales allows the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open over the next several months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully open them. The other agent is the [[Douglas squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus douglasi'') that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. The squirrels are active year round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nps.gov/seki/naturescience/upload/hh_tt67.pdf|title=The Fire Ecology of Sequoia Regeneration|journal=Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference|volume=7|page=7|first1=RJ|last1=Hartesveldt|first2=HT|last2=Harvey|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Giant sequoia exhibitionism.jpg|thumb|Shortly after their discovery by Europeans, giant sequoias were subject to much exhibition]]\nThe giant sequoia was well known to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes living in its area. Native American names for the species include ''wawona'', ''toos-pung-ish'' and ''hea-mi-withic'', the latter two in the language of the Tule River Tribe.\n\nThe first reference to the giant sequoia by Europeans is in 1833, in the diary of the explorer J. K. Leonard; the reference does not mention any locality, but his route would have taken him through the [[Calaveras Big Trees State Park|Calaveras Grove]].<ref name=\"farquhar\">{{cite journal|last=Farquhar|first=Francis P.|title=Discovery of the Sierra Nevada|year=1925|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|volume=4|pages=3\u201358|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/exploration_of_the_sierra_nevada/|issue=1|doi=10.2307/25177743|jstor=25177743}}, Yosemite.ca.us</ref> This discovery was not publicized.

Dowd of the Calaveras Grove in 1852, and this is commonly cited as the species' discovery.<ref name=\"farquhar\"/> The tree found by Dowd, christened the 'Discovery Tree', was felled in 1853.\n\nThe first scientific naming of the species was by [[John Lindley]] in December 1853, who named it ''Wellingtonia gigantea'', without realizing this was an invalid name under the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|botanical code]] as the name ''Wellingtonia'' had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant (''[[Wellingtonia arnottiana]]'' in the family [[Sabiaceae]]).

The name ''Washingtonia californica'' was also applied to it by Winslow in 1854, though this too is invalid, belonging to the [[Arecaceae|palm]] genus ''[[Washingtonia]]''.\n[[File:Closepintree.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Clothespin tree in the [[Mariposa Grove]], [[Yosemite National Park]]]]\nIn 1907, it was placed by [[Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze]] in the otherwise [[fossil]] genus ''[[Steinhauera]]'', but doubt as to whether the giant sequoia is related to the fossil originally so named makes this name invalid.\n\nThe nomenclatural oversights were finally corrected in 1939 by [[John T.

From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The [[Hume-Bennett Lumber Company]] was the last to harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title = Battle against Rough fire intensifies as blaze bears down on Hume Lake|url = http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article31640498.html|website = fresnobee|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}</ref> Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.\n\nPictures of the once majestic trees broken and abandoned in formerly pristine groves, and the thought of the giants put to such modest use, spurred the public outcry that caused most of the groves to be preserved as protected land. The public can visit an example of 1880s clear-cutting at [[Big Stump Grove]] near [[General Grant Grove]]. As late as the 1980s, some immature trees were logged in [[Sequoia National Forest]], publicity of which helped lead to the creation of [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe wood from immature trees is less brittle, with recent tests on young [[plantation]]-grown trees showing it similar to coast redwood wood in quality. This is resulting in some interest in cultivating giant sequoia as a very high-yielding timber crop tree, both in California and also in parts of western Europe, where it may grow more efficiently than coast redwoods. In the northwest [[United States]], some entrepreneurs have also begun growing giant sequoias for [[Christmas tree]]s. Besides these attempts at tree farming, the principal economic uses for giant sequoia today are [[tourism]] and [[horticulture]].\n\n==Cultivation==\nGiant sequoia is a very popular [[ornamental tree]] in many areas. It is successfully grown in most of western and southern Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America north to southwest [[British Columbia]], the southern United States, southeast Australia, New Zealand and central-southern [[Chile]]. It is also grown, though less successfully, in parts of eastern North America.\n\nTrees can withstand temperatures of \u221231&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221225&nbsp;\u00b0F) or colder for short periods of time, provided the ground around the roots is insulated with either heavy snow or mulch. Outside its natural range, the foliage can suffer from damaging windburn.\n\nA wide range of [[cultivar|horticultural varieties]] have been selected, especially in Europe, including blue, compact blue, powder blue, hazel smith, pendulum{{emdash}}or weeping{{emdash}}varieties, and [[Grafting|grafted]] cultivars.<ref name=cultivars>{{cite web|url=http://nurseryguide.com/browse2.lasso?Indent=2&Indent2=C-230|title=Species Level Browse Results|date=2011|work=NurseryGuide.com|publisher=Oregon Association of Nurseries|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309050448/http://nurseryguide.com/browse2.lasso?Indent=2&Indent2=C-230|archive-date=2012-03-09|access-date=2016-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Sequoias in EuroDisney, some years later.jpg|thumb|right|Sequoias in Eurodisney (near Paris) in 2009 and 2017]]\n\n===France===\nThe tallest giant sequoia ever measured outside of the United States<ref name=outside_the_US>{{cite web |url=http://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/trees/giantsequoia/records/ |title=The thickest, tallest, and oldest giant sequoia trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum) |publisher=monumentaltrees.com |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref> is a specimen planted near [[Ribeauvill\u00e9]] in [[France]] in 1856 and measured in 2014 at a height between {{convert|57.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ribeauville\">{{cite web |url=http://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/fra/hautrhin/ribeauville/6150_foretdomanialederibeauville/12175/ |title=Giant sequoia in the for\u00eat domaniale de Ribeauvill\u00e9 |publisher=monumentaltrees.com |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref> and {{convert|58.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref name=Ribeauville>{{cite web |url=http://www.sequoias.eu/Pages/Locations/Alsace/ribeauville_foret_domaniale.htm |title=RIQUEWIHR/RIBEAUVILL\u00c9 (68) : For\u00eat Domaniale de Ribeauvill\u00e9 |publisher=Sequoias.eu |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}</ref> at age 158 years.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:Benmore.jpg|thumb|The well-known giant sequoia [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] planted in 1863 at [[Benmore Botanic Garden]], Scotland.
