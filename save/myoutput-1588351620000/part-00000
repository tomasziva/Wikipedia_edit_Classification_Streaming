He also continued to speak out against violence and mismanagement within CZW. This drew the ire of several roster members such as former training partner [[Danny Havoc]], [[Jon Moxley]], and Devon Moore, who began interrupting Gulak's presentations and attacking him. In response, Gulak hired Nui Tofiga for protection. On June 11, 2011, Gulak lost the Wired TV Championship to [[AR Fox]] at ''Prelude to Violence 2''.

During this time, Gulak stopped the PowerPoint Presentations and his \"No-Fly Zone\" campaign for a better ''205 Live'', and developed a new character with aspirations to be the best submission specialist in WWE. Around this time, Gulak formed an alliance with [[Gentleman Jack Gallagher]] and [[Brian Kendrick|The Brian Kendrick]] to feud with Lucha House Party ([[Kalisto (wrestler)|Kalisto]], [[M\u00e1scara Dorada|Gran Metalik]], and [[Lince Dorado]]), with the two teams trading victories, including a six-man tag team elimination match, which Gulak won for his team.<ref>https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2780859?fb_comment_id=1954452501245560_1955620714462072</ref> On the July 24 episode of ''205 Live'', Gulak won a fatal four-way match also involving Mustafa Ali, Hideo Itami and TJP to become the number one contender to the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.

Afterwards, Gulak and Gallagher would try to recruit [[Humberto Carrillo]] into their stable, while also trying to convince him to stop using high-flying moves and adopt more ground based offense. Gulak competed in a tournament to determine a new challenger for [[Buddy Murphy]]'s Cruiserweight Championship at [[WrestleMania 35]], where he defeated The Brian Kendrick in the first round, but lost to eventual winner Tony Nese in the semifinals. On the April 9, 2019 episode of ''205 Live'', after Gulak attacked Humberto Carrillo during his match with Gallagher, Gallagher headbutted Gulak out of the ring, thus ending their alliance. \n\nFollowing April, Gulak was taken off television and posted a series of cryptic tweets hinting at a dark turn for his character.{{cn|date=July 2019}} He returned to the ring in June, displaying a more aggressive attitude and in-ring repertoire.
