It was one of the 18 Massachusetts regiments formed in response to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] August 1862 call for 300,000 men to serve for nine months. It consisted of a combination of [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]] [[Company (military unit)|companies]] and [[Irish-Americans in the American Civil War|Irish-American]] companies which caused some delay and friction. The regiment was assigned to the [[Department of the Gulf]] and saw heavy combat during the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].\n\n==Formation and early duty==\n\nThe formation of the 48th Massachusetts was marked by some dissension as it was originally intended to be an Essex County regiment and eight companies were raised from that county for that purpose. However, due to the urgent need for regiments in the [[Department of the Gulf]] in preparation for [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]'s planned expedition against [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], two companies were detached and the remaining six companies were combined with four Irish-American companies. The latter had intended to fill out their numbers and form a new Irish unit. The unexpected combination led to a number of desertions from [[Camp Meigs]] where the regiment trained. The reassignments and difficulty in recruited somewhat delayed the mustering in of the unit which was finally completed on December 9, 1862.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=645}}\n\n[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Eben F. Stone]], a prominent lawyer from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], commanded the regiment. The 48th Massachusetts departed Massachusetts on December 27 for [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. After stays in [[New York City]] and [[Fortress Monroe]], the regiment reached their destination on February 1, 1863. They were stationed at Camp Banks in [[Baton Rouge, Louis|Baton Rouge]]. Their first field duty consisted of a reconnaissance towards Port Hudson with other units of the [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] from March 13\u201320. They did not see any combat during this reconnaissance and afterwards returned to their post at Camp Banks.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=645}}{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1265}}\n\n==Siege of Port Hudson==\n\nThey remained at Camp Banks for two months serving uneventful duty as planning for the expedition against Port Hudson encountered logistical delays. The expedition got underway in late May 1862 and the 48th Massachusetts left Camp Banks as part of the expedition on May 21. The regiment saw its first combat before the day was out as Union forces just outside of Baton Rouge encountered a [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] column from Port Hudson precipitating the [[Battle of Plains Store]]. The 48th Massachusetts was posted in support of an artillery battery and did not see action during the day. However, that night a Confederate unit got around their flank and attacked them from the rear, causing much confusion. The unit suffered casualties of 2 men killed, 7 wounded and 11 prisoners.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=647}} During this engagement, Union troops succeeded in cutting off the last route of escape from Port Hudson.\n\nOn May 27, the 48th Massachusetts took part in the [[Siege of Port Hudson|first assault on Port Hudson]]. 200 volunteers were called on from their [[Division (military unit)|division]] for a storming party to lead the division's charge and lay down [[fascine]]s to allow passage over ditches and trenches. The 48th Massachusetts supplied half the number of volunteers needed for this detail. During the assault, however, the extremely rugged ground and earthworks proved too difficult and neither the storming party nor the main assault made much progress. The regiment lost six killed and 41 wounded during this assault, including their second-in-command, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] James O'Brien (who was originally to command the intended Irish regiment).{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=648}}\n\nAs Union forces settled in for a siege, the 48th Massachusetts returned to Baton Rouge for a short time to serve guard duty. In June they returned to the Port Hudson siege lines and participated in the second assault on the city on June 14. The regiment fired in support of several units assigned to storm the enemy's earthworks. This second assault also failed. The 48th Massachusetts lost two men killed and eleven wounded. The Confederate troops in Port Hudson eventually surrendered on July 9, 1863.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=648}}\n\n==Battle of Cox's Plantation==\n\nFollowing the surrender, the 48th Massachusetts immediately moved with their division to [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]] as part of operations to engage the remaining Confederate forces in western Louisiana. The regiment fought in the [[Battle of Kock's Plantation|Battle of Cox's Plantation]] on July 11 and 12. Confederate forces pushed superior Union numbers back six miles during this engagement. During the withdrawal, the 48th Massachusetts lost one man killed, seven wounded and 23 captured.
