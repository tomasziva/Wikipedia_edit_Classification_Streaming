In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise.\n\n==Creation==\n===Concept and design===\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character.

One example was Cloud trying to emotionally support Tifa during a sad scene, imitating Barret's actions but he fails to cause the same impact. As a result, the staff states that Cloud is a teenager trying to act like an adult in this scenario. When it comes to being close to other characters, Cloud is annoyed by the flirts of Jeesie but instead tries acting cool with Aerith. For, Square made Aerith warn Cloud of not getting emotionally attached to her, giving the players multiple interpreations in regards of this in case they are warned of Aerith's tragic fate or instead just looking down on him. In the climax of the remake, Cloud encounters his nemesis, Sephiroth, once again. Sephiroth's words following the fight were kept as ambiguous.<ref>{{cite book|title=Final Fantasy VII Remake Ultimania|year=2020|publisher=Square Enix|url=https://aitaikimochi.tumblr.com/post/616804865416527872}}</ref>\n\nCo-director Naoki Hamaguchi noted that since in the original game, the player could decide Cloud's interest in a female character, he wanted the remake to give this possibility again in the form of an intimate conversation when splitting from the main team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/final-fantasy-vii-remake-interview-yoshinori-kitase-naoki-hamaguchi/|title=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Creators Explain Episodic Release|publisher=Nerdist|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Due to Cloud being in a possible relationship with Tifa or Aerith, the development team observed fans thought Square was preferring any of these two heroines over the other.

main [[protagonist]] of [[Square (video game company)|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]'s) 1997 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and several of its [[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII|sequels and spin-offs]]. In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise.\n\n==Creation==\n===Concept and design===\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel.

One example was Cloud trying to emotionally support Tifa during a sad scene, imitating Barret's actions but he fails to cause the same impact. As a result, the staff states that Cloud is a teenager trying to act like an adult in this scenario. When it comes to being close to other characters, Cloud is annoyed by the flirts of Jeesie but instead tries acting cool with Aerith. For, Square made Aerith warn Cloud of not getting emotionally attached to her, giving the players multiple interpreations in regards of this in case they are warned of Aerith's tragic fate or instead just looking down on him. In the climax of the remake, Cloud encounters his nemesis, Sephiroth, once again. Sephiroth's words following the fight were kept as ambiguous.<ref>{{cite book|title=Final Fantasy VII Remake Ultimania|year=2020|publisher=Square Enix|url=https://aitaikimochi.tumblr.com/post/616804865416527872}}</ref>\n\nCo-director Naoki Hamaguchi noted that since in the original game, the player could decide Cloud's interest in a female character, he wanted the remake to give this possibility again in the form of an intimate conversation when splitting from the main team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/final-fantasy-vii-remake-interview-yoshinori-kitase-naoki-hamaguchi/|title=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Creators Explain Episodic Release|publisher=Nerdist|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Due to Cloud being in a possible relationship with Tifa or Aerith, the development team observed fans thought Square was preferring any of these two heroines over the other.

While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud's outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects.<ref name=\"InteSakurai\" /> A fan of ''VII'', Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental.<ref name=\"rf\" /> After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans' response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him.<ref name=\"InteSakurai\" /> While recording ''Crisis Core'', Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud's scream over Zack's death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending.<ref name=\"InteSakurai\" /> Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a ''Final Fantasy VII'' fan himself, he is happy to contribute.<ref name=\"InteSakurai\">{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix }}</ref> \n\nIn regards to the remake of ''Final Fantasy VII'', Sakurai found the younger Cloud difficult to portray due to how different he is in this game and thus hoped to get attached to this incarnation of him.
