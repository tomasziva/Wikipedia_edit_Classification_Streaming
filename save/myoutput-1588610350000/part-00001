This would be Close's final theatrical film role of the decade, since she began to star in her own television series, ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' (2007). Close was asked about her contributions to independent films, to which she responded \"I love the casts that gather around a good piece of writing certainly not for the money but because it is good and challenging.
