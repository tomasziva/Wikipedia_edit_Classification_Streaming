Furthermore there is a strategic defensive factor: making sure the China is not the single dominant factor in Asian economics.<ref>Irene Chan, \"Reversing China\u2019s Belt-and-Road Initiative\u2014Singapore\u2019s Response to the BRI and Its Quest for Relevance.\" ''East Asia'' 36.3 (2019): 185-204.</ref>\n\nAlthough the '''Philippines''' historically has been closely tied to the United States, China has sought its support for the BRI in terms of the quest for dominance in the South China Sea.

Many further areas of commerce are being involved nowadays; ports in [[Oman]], factories in [[Algeria]], skyscrapers in [[Egypt]]'s new capital, etc. China is interested in providing financial security to those countries, who after many Arab wars and American interventions, live off the U.S support. On the one hand, Arab countries gain independence and on the other, China opens the door of a colossal market. As the president of [[Lebanon]] [[Michel Aoun]] stated, \"We regard China as a good friend and are willing to further consolidate the relationship with China.

More than half the continent has already signed partnerships with the Middle Kingdom.

Many further areas of commerce are being involved nowadays; ports in [[Oman]], factories in [[Algeria]], skyscrapers in [[Egypt]]'s new capital, etc. China is interested in providing financial security to those countries, who after many Arab wars and American interventions, live off the U.S support. On the one hand, Arab countries gain independence and on the other, China opens the door of a colossal market. As the president of [[Lebanon]] [[Michel Aoun]] stated, \"We regard China as a good friend and are willing to further consolidate the relationship with China.
