Sidle is a [[Forensic science|forensic scientist]] and one of the core characters of the show, which revolves around a [[forensics|Crime Scene Investigation]] team in [[Clark County, Nevada]], that investigates cases in and around [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Fox appeared in both the first eight seasons and the final five seasons of the show as a series regular. She also recurred throughout the ninth and tenth seasons of the series and headlined ''Immortality'' alongside [[Ted Danson]].\n\n==Appearances==\n=== Original Tenure ===\nIn each of the series' first seven seasons, Fox appeared in all but one episode each season, and then appeared in the first seven episodes of the eighth season before departing the main cast.\n\n=== Guest star ===\nDuring her absence from the main cast, Fox guest starred in twenty episodes.\n\n=== Return ===\nUpon rejoining the regular cast in the series' eleventh season, Fox once again appeared in most episodes, including the series finale.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSidle was born on September 16, 1971, in [[Tomales Bay]]<!-- NOTE1: Yes, Tamales. The REAL city is Tomales, but the bio from CBS spells it with an A. -->, an hour and a half north of [[San Francisco]]. Her father was an abusive alcoholic and was killed by Sidle's [[schizophrenic]] mother in 1984. Afterward, she spent time in the [[foster care|foster care system]], which didn't keep her from graduating from high school as [[valedictorian]] at age 16.<ref>Marrinan and Parker (2006), p. 59</ref> She attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]] on a scholarship, moving on to [[graduate school]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. While at Berkeley, she started a work-study position at the San Francisco [[Coroner]]'s Office, where she would also audit lectures to keep up with new developments; it was at one of these that she met [[Gil Grissom]].<ref>[http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/bios/ CBS.com \"CSI\"s characters official biographies] Retrieved on 2007-10-21.</ref>\n\nSome time later, while she was working in San Francisco, Grissom called her because he needed someone outside the [[Las Vegas]] team. Sidle went to Las Vegas and helped resolve some [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] problems within the CSIs while also providing a replacement for [[Holly Gribbs]], who had been shot.<ref>\"Cool Change\". [[Anthony E. Zuiker]] (writer) & [[Michael W. Watkins|Michael Watkins]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2000-10-13. Season 1 Ep. 2.</ref> Some episodes later, she became a permanent member of the night shift as a CSI Level 3 at the LVPD Criminalistics Bureau, specialising in materials and element analysis. In [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 8)|Season 8]], Sidle briefly changed from nights to swing shifts. In the Season 10 premiere, it is revealed she is married to Grissom. In Season 13, Episode 15, she reveals that Grissom had split up with her. However in series finale \"[[Immortality (CSI)|Immortality]]\", she and Grissom are reunited.\n\n==Character development==\nPerhaps because of her traumatic childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers.<ref>Marrinan and Parker (2006), p. 60</ref> She also has a soft spot for animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig.<ref>\"Burden of Proof\". [[Ann Donahue]] (writers) & [[Kenneth Fink]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2002-02-07. Season 2 Ep. 15.</ref> She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps because of her mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.\n\nIn the early years of the show, Sidle is depicted as antisocial. Her hobbies are all work-related (listening to her [[police scanner]] and reading [[forensics|forensic journal]]s); and she claims to prefer working with corpses over live people. In a mid-[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 2)|second season]] episode, she realizes how much she is missing out on and decides to \"get a life\" outside of work.<ref>\"You've Got Male\".

Later in the third season, she is injured in an explosion in the lab in search of Grissom, at the end of the episode  she decides to ask Grissom to dinner though he turns her down, stating he doesn't know what to do about \"this.\".\n[[Image:CSI nesting dolls.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sara Sidle breaks down on the fifth season episode \"Nesting Dolls\".]]\n\nDuring the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 4)|fourth]] and [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 5)|fifth]] seasons, Sidle seems to be on a downward spiral as her memories of childhood resurface, with cases becoming more difficult for her emotionally. Also, the fact that Grissom decided to promote [[Nick Stokes]] instead of Sidle, did not help. Season Four concludes with Sidle being stopped by a traffic cop. Although she is [[driving under the influence]], she is not charged, but Grissom, as her supervisor, is informed of her arrest. He arrives at the station to bring her home, and finally seems to notice her emotional state.<ref>\"Bloodlines\".

Following this incident, she admits to Grissom that she has a problem with authority, has chosen emotionally unavailable men (like Grissom), and has a self-destructive streak. Sidle then opens up to him and reveals her family story;<ref name=\"Nesting Dolls p. 13\">\"Nesting Dolls\". [[Sarah Goldfinger]] (writers) & [[Bill Eagles]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2005-2-3.

In the letter she states that ever since her father's death she has been living with \"ghosts\" and that she now needs to go away and deal with them before self-destructing.\n\nIn the season eight episode \"You Kill Me\", Grissom indicates he has talked with her and that she is in San Francisco visiting her mother.\n\nPromos for the season nine premiere announced that actress Jorja Fox would return, and showed her in three clips. However, Sidle left again after the second episode. She appeared again in the final scene of the tenth episode of season nine when she appears to be working on a research team in [[Costa Rica]], where Grissom joins her after leaving CSI.

She is  brought back by Under-Sheriff Ecklie to aid the lab, which has undergone staffing cuts as a result of Warrick's death and the resignation of his replacement, Riley Adams. Adams was revealed to have resigned as a result of Catherine's poor management and lack of teamwork; when Catherine reveals this to Sara, she reminds Catherine that Grissom had Catherine as a number two, prompting the promotion of Nick Stokes to Assistant Supervisor.\n\n==Relationships==\nSara Sidle's romantic relationships have been largely unsuccessful. In the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 1)|first season]] she named a college boyfriend, Ken Fuller, with whom she had an unsatisfactory relationship, also saying that they had joined the [[Mile high club]] (Unfriendly Skies). In [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 7)|season seven]] she mentioned a college boyfriend who cheated on her. It is unclear whether Fuller was also the boyfriend who cheated on her. In the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 3)|third season]] she had a [[casual relationship]] with Hank Pettigrew, who was an [[emergency medical technician]]. He was involved in several of her cases, but they later broke up after she found out Hank had a longtime girlfriend.<ref>\"Crash and Burn\". [[Josh Berman]] (writers) & [[Richard J.

In this episode, Grissom admitted that he was unable to risk his career to be with her. In this season Sara Sidle apparently developed a drinking problem, which Grissom acknowledged in the season finale. In the next season, Sidle was suspended for insubordination and told Grissom about her tormented childhood. He refused to fire her and had her working with him in almost every episode from season six and season seven.<ref name=\"Nesting Dolls p. 13\"/>[[Image:Grissomsara csi.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|[[Gil Grissom]] and Sara Sidle on the fourth season episode \"Invisible Evidence\"]]\nIt was not until the sixth season finale that it is revealed that Grissom and Sidle have worked through whatever issues they had and are, in fact, a couple.<ref>\"Way To Go\". [[Jerry Stahl]] (writers) & [[Kenneth Fink]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2006-5-18. Season 6 Ep. 24.</ref> In season eight it was revealed they have been intimately involved for two years. This revelation caused mixed emotions from fans, some of whom see this relationship as ''CSI'' \"[[jumping the shark]],\" an attempt to include more drama and romance to the show to compete with the medical drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which airs in the U.S. at the same time.<ref>[http://www.jumptheshark.com/topic/Csi-Crime-Scene-Investigation/Csi-Crime-Scene-Investigation-General/449 CSI in JumpTheShark.com] Retrieved on 2007-10-21.</ref> By resolving the sexual tension between the two characters, critics posited that the show might appeal to some of ''Grey's'' younger audience.<ref>[http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Hein-Sight/Note-Csi-Dont/700003961&start=30 TVguide-\"Note to CSI\u2014Don't Do It\"] Retrieved on 2007-10-21.</ref> This has been denied by the writers. In one interview, producer [[Carol Mendelsohn]] said that she has never been able to see Grissom with any other character other than Sidle and that this episode was seen by the writers as the right time to reveal the relationship.

While he is in his bedroom, she snoops around and finds a woman's dressing robe in his closet. She then notices a photograph of Gil and Sara together on the fridge. When Grissom emerges from his room, she asks him \"How long have you and Sara been together?\" He tries to make a quick exit but not before she tells him she'd always thought he was a lonely bachelor, to which his response is to laugh and leave.\n\nIn the tenth episode of season nine, \"One to Go\", Grissom is seen walking through a rain forest holding a GPS System that places him in Costa Rica. He spots a bug on a leaf, but continues, eventually arriving at a camp where Sidle is seen taking a picture of a monkey in a tree. Sidle then sees Grissom, who removes his backpack and walks into Sidle's arms and greets her with a passionate kiss.\n\nIn \"Family Affair\", the first episode of Season 10, Sidle returns to work in the laboratory on a temporary basis, revealing that she and Grissom are now married and have been living in Paris while Grissom conducts a seminar at the [[Sorbonne]].\n\nIn \"The Two Mrs. Grissoms\", Sara attends a party for a school for the deaf. She then gets a call from Grissom during a Taiko drum performance. It was revealed that Grissom was in Peru consulting for the government. She then meets Grissom's mother, Betty, and two deaf professors, at which one of them ends up dead in a car explosion. periodt \n\nGrissom's mother ends up criticising Sara for not spending much time with Grissom.\n\nAt the end of the episode, she is shown talking with Grissom on a webcam, eventually having his mother walk into the office. Grissom then said that he will return to Vegas to have dinner with Sara and his mother.\n\nAt the end of \"Malice in Wonderland\" Grissom sends Sara two plants with a note saying \"From Grissom\"\n\nHints of a troubled relationship appear in several episodes in Season 13. In the episode \"Forget Me Not\" Sara finally reveals that she and Grissom had split up. In the end of the episode, she admitted to Nick and Greg that at the night of the murder she was expecting to see Grissom; Nick even admits that he and everyone else that worked with Grissom liked having them both together to sort of hang on to but realized that if the relationship is over, it's over.\n\nAfter remaining separated for a number of years, Grissom and Sara are re-united in the series finale [[Immortality (CSI)|Immortality]], when a case involving a suicide bomber brings Grissom temporarily back to the Las Vegas crime lab. The series ends with the pair sailing away together into the sunset, their relationship apparently rekindled.\n\n[[William Petersen]] has said that what Grissom loves about Sidle is her tenacity. \"She's a bulldog. And he always saw that in her. And he always knew that subconsciously the only person who'd be able to give him a second look is someone who's not willing to take the first look for granted.\"<ref>[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/csi/index.html Chicago Tribune - \"Bound for home: Chicago's William Petersen looks beyond CSI to a return to the stage\"] Retrieved on 2007-11-06.</ref> On her side, [[Jorja Fox]] has said that \"The story of Sara and Grissom is a little like a [[fable]].

Sidle is a [[Forensic science|forensic scientist]] and one of the core characters of the show, which revolves around a [[forensics|Crime Scene Investigation]] team in [[Clark County, Nevada]], that investigates cases in and around [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Fox appeared in both the first eight seasons and the final five seasons of the show as a series regular. She also recurred throughout the ninth and tenth seasons of the series and headlined ''Immortality'' alongside [[Ted Danson]].\n\n==Appearances==\n=== Original Tenure ===\nIn each of the series' first seven seasons, Fox appeared in all but one episode each season, and then appeared in the first seven episodes of the eighth season before departing the main cast.\n\n=== Guest star ===\nDuring her absence from the main cast, Fox guest starred in twenty episodes.\n\n=== Return ===\nUpon rejoining the regular cast in the series' eleventh season, Fox once again appeared in most episodes, including the series finale.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSidle was born on September 16, 1971, in [[Tomales Bay]]<!-- NOTE1: Yes, Tamales. The REAL city is Tomales, but the bio from CBS spells it with an A. -->, an hour and a half north of [[San Francisco]]. Her father was an abusive alcoholic and was killed by Sidle's [[schizophrenic]] mother in 1984. Afterward, she spent time in the [[foster care|foster care system]], which didn't keep her from graduating from high school as [[valedictorian]] at age 16.<ref>Marrinan and Parker (2006), p. 59</ref> She attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]] on a scholarship, moving on to [[graduate school]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. While at Berkeley, she started a work-study position at the San Francisco [[Coroner]]'s Office, where she would also audit lectures to keep up with new developments; it was at one of these that she met [[Gil Grissom]].<ref>[http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/bios/ CBS.com \"CSI\"s characters official biographies] Retrieved on 2007-10-21.</ref>\n\nSome time later, while she was working in San Francisco, Grissom called her because he needed someone outside the [[Las Vegas]] team. Sidle went to Las Vegas and helped resolve some [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] problems within the CSIs while also providing a replacement for [[Holly Gribbs]], who had been shot.<ref>\"Cool Change\". [[Anthony E. Zuiker]] (writer) & [[Michael W. Watkins|Michael Watkins]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2000-10-13. Season 1 Ep. 2.</ref> Some episodes later, she became a permanent member of the night shift as a CSI Level 3 at the LVPD Criminalistics Bureau, specialising in materials and element analysis. In [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 8)|Season 8]], Sidle briefly changed from nights to swing shifts. In the Season 10 premiere, it is revealed she is married to Grissom. In Season 13, Episode 15, she reveals that Grissom had split up with her. However in series finale \"[[Immortality (CSI)|Immortality]]\", she and Grissom are reunited.\n\n==Character development==\nPerhaps because of her traumatic childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers.<ref>Marrinan and Parker (2006), p. 60</ref> She also has a soft spot for animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig.<ref>\"Burden of Proof\". [[Ann Donahue]] (writers) & [[Kenneth Fink]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2002-02-07. Season 2 Ep. 15.</ref> She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps because of her mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.\n\nIn the early years of the show, Sidle is depicted as antisocial. Her hobbies are all work-related (listening to her [[police scanner]] and reading [[forensics|forensic journal]]s); and she claims to prefer working with corpses over live people. In a mid-[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 2)|second season]] episode, she realizes how much she is missing out on and decides to \"get a life\" outside of work.<ref>\"You've Got Male\". [[Marc Dube]], Corey Miller (writers) & Charlie Correll (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2001-12-20. Season 2 Ep. 12.</ref> During [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 3)|season three]] she dates a paramedic named Hank Pettigrew, but this relationship ends later in the season when she discovered that he had a longtime girlfriend. Later in the third season, she is injured in an explosion in the lab in search of Grissom, at the end of the episode  she decides to ask Grissom to dinner though he turns her down, stating he doesn't know what to do about \"this.\".\n[[Image:CSI nesting dolls.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sara Sidle breaks down on the fifth season episode \"Nesting Dolls\".]]\n\nDuring the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 4)|fourth]] and [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 5)|fifth]] seasons, Sidle seems to be on a downward spiral as her memories of childhood resurface, with cases becoming more difficult for her emotionally. Also, the fact that Grissom decided to promote [[Nick Stokes]] instead of Sidle, did not help. Season Four concludes with Sidle being stopped by a traffic cop. Although she is [[driving under the influence]], she is not charged, but Grissom, as her supervisor, is informed of her arrest. He arrives at the station to bring her home, and finally seems to notice her emotional state.<ref>\"Bloodlines\".

Following this incident, she admits to Grissom that she has a problem with authority, has chosen emotionally unavailable men (like Grissom), and has a self-destructive streak. Sidle then opens up to him and reveals her family story;<ref name=\"Nesting Dolls p. 13\">\"Nesting Dolls\". [[Sarah Goldfinger]] (writers) & [[Bill Eagles]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2005-2-3.

In the letter she states that ever since her father's death she has been living with \"ghosts\" and that she now needs to go away and deal with them before self-destructing.\n\nIn the season eight episode \"You Kill Me\", Grissom indicates he has talked with her and that she is in San Francisco visiting her mother.\n\nPromos for the season nine premiere announced that actress Jorja Fox would return, and showed her in three clips. However, Sidle left again after the second episode. She appeared again in the final scene of the tenth episode of season nine when she appears to be working on a research team in [[Costa Rica]], where Grissom joins her after leaving CSI.

She is  brought back by Under-Sheriff Ecklie to aid the lab, which has undergone staffing cuts as a result of Warrick's death and the resignation of his replacement, Riley Adams. Adams was revealed to have resigned as a result of Catherine's poor management and lack of teamwork; when Catherine reveals this to Sara, she reminds Catherine that Grissom had Catherine as a number two, prompting the promotion of Nick Stokes to Assistant Supervisor.\n\n==Relationships==\nSara Sidle's romantic relationships have been largely unsuccessful. In the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 1)|first season]] she named a college boyfriend, Ken Fuller, with whom she had an unsatisfactory relationship, also saying that they had joined the [[Mile high club]] (Unfriendly Skies). In [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 7)|season seven]] she mentioned a college boyfriend who cheated on her. It is unclear whether Fuller was also the boyfriend who cheated on her. In the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 3)|third season]] she had a [[casual relationship]] with Hank Pettigrew, who was an [[emergency medical technician]]. He was involved in several of her cases, but they later broke up after she found out Hank had a longtime girlfriend.<ref>\"Crash and Burn\". [[Josh Berman]] (writers) & [[Richard J.

In this episode, Grissom admitted that he was unable to risk his career to be with her. In this season Sara Sidle apparently developed a drinking problem, which Grissom acknowledged in the season finale. In the next season, Sidle was suspended for insubordination and told Grissom about her tormented childhood. He refused to fire her and had her working with him in almost every episode from season six and season seven.<ref name=\"Nesting Dolls p. 13\"/>[[Image:Grissomsara csi.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|[[Gil Grissom]] and Sara Sidle on the fourth season episode \"Invisible Evidence\"]]\nIt was not until the sixth season finale that it is revealed that Grissom and Sidle have worked through whatever issues they had and are, in fact, a couple.<ref>\"Way To Go\". [[Jerry Stahl]] (writers) & [[Kenneth Fink]] (director). ''CSI''. [[CBS]]. 2006-5-18. Season 6 Ep. 24.</ref> In season eight it was revealed they have been intimately involved for two years. This revelation caused mixed emotions from fans, some of whom see this relationship as ''CSI'' \"[[jumping the shark]],\" an attempt to include more drama and romance to the show to compete with the medical drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which airs in the U.S. at the same time.<ref>[http://www.jumptheshark.com/topic/Csi-Crime-Scene-Investigation/Csi-Crime-Scene-Investigation-General/449 CSI in JumpTheShark.com] Retrieved on 2007-10-21.</ref> By resolving the sexual tension between the two characters, critics posited that the show might appeal to some of ''Grey's'' younger audience.<ref>[http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Hein-Sight/Note-Csi-Dont/700003961&start=30 TVguide-\"Note to CSI\u2014Don't Do It\"] Retrieved on 2007-10-21.</ref> This has been denied by the writers. In one interview, producer [[Carol Mendelsohn]] said that she has never been able to see Grissom with any other character other than Sidle and that this episode was seen by the writers as the right time to reveal the relationship.

While he is in his bedroom, she snoops around and finds a woman's dressing robe in his closet. She then notices a photograph of Gil and Sara together on the fridge. When Grissom emerges from his room, she asks him \"How long have you and Sara been together?\" He tries to make a quick exit but not before she tells him she'd always thought he was a lonely bachelor, to which his response is to laugh and leave.\n\nIn the tenth episode of season nine, \"One to Go\", Grissom is seen walking through a rain forest holding a GPS System that places him in Costa Rica. He spots a bug on a leaf, but continues, eventually arriving at a camp where Sidle is seen taking a picture of a monkey in a tree. Sidle then sees Grissom, who removes his backpack and walks into Sidle's arms and greets her with a passionate kiss.\n\nIn \"Family Affair\", the first episode of Season 10, Sidle returns to work in the laboratory on a temporary basis, revealing that she and Grissom are now married and have been living in Paris while Grissom conducts a seminar at the [[Sorbonne]].\n\nIn \"The Two Mrs. Grissoms\", Sara attends a party for a school for the deaf. She then gets a call from Grissom during a Taiko drum performance. It was revealed that Grissom was in Peru consulting for the government. She then meets Grissom's mother, Betty, and two deaf professors, at which one of them ends up dead in a car explosion.\n\nGrissom's mother ends up criticising Sara for not spending much time with Grissom.\n\nAt the end of the episode, she is shown talking with Grissom on a webcam, eventually having his mother walk into the office. Grissom then said that he will return to Vegas to have dinner with Sara and his mother.\n\nAt the end of \"Malice in Wonderland\" Grissom sends Sara two plants with a note saying \"From Grissom\"\n\nHints of a troubled relationship appear in several episodes in Season 13. In the episode \"Forget Me Not\" Sara finally reveals that she and Grissom had split up. In the end of the episode, she admitted to Nick and Greg that at the night of the murder she was expecting to see Grissom; Nick even admits that he and everyone else that worked with Grissom liked having them both together to sort of hang on to but realized that if the relationship is over, it's over.\n\nAfter remaining separated for a number of years, Grissom and Sara are re-united in the series finale [[Immortality (CSI)|Immortality]], when a case involving a suicide bomber brings Grissom temporarily back to the Las Vegas crime lab. The series ends with the pair sailing away together into the sunset, their relationship apparently rekindled.\n\n[[William Petersen]] has said that what Grissom loves about Sidle is her tenacity. \"She's a bulldog. And he always saw that in her. And he always knew that subconsciously the only person who'd be able to give him a second look is someone who's not willing to take the first look for granted.\"<ref>[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/csi/index.html Chicago Tribune - \"Bound for home: Chicago's William Petersen looks beyond CSI to a return to the stage\"] Retrieved on 2007-11-06.</ref> On her side, [[Jorja Fox]] has said that \"The story of Sara and Grissom is a little like a [[fable]].
