Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] and capital of the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}.\n\nIt is the province's political, commercial, and industrial hub and the location of the Ilocos Region's busiest [[Laoag International Airport|commercial airport]].\n\nThe municipalities of [[San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte|San Nicolas]], [[Paoay, Ilocos Norte|Paoay]], [[Sarrat, Ilocos Norte|Sarrat]], [[Vintar, Ilocos Norte|Vintar]], and [[Bacarra, Ilocos Norte|Bacarra]] form its boundaries. The foothills of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] mountain range to the east, and the [[West Philippine Sea]] to the west are its physical boundaries.\n\nLaoag experiences the prevailing [[monsoon]] climate of Northern [[Luzon]], characterized by a dry season from November to April and a wet season from May to October, occasionally visited by powerful [[typhoon]]s.\n\n==History==\nLong before the coming of the Spaniards, there already existed an extensive region consisting of the present provinces of [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Abra (province)|Abra]] and [[La Union]] renowned for its gold mines.  Merchants from [[Japan]] and [[China]] would often visit the area to trade gold with beads, ceramics and silk.  The [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] inhabitants of the region called their place ''samtoy'', from ''sao mi itoy'', which literally meant \"this is our language.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1571, when the [[Spanish conquistadors]] had [[Manila]] more or less under their control, they began looking for new sites to conquer. Legaspi's grandson, Juan de Salcedo, volunteered to lead one of these expeditions.  Together with eight armed boats and 45 men, the 22-year-old voyager headed north.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nOn June 13, 1572, Salcedo and his men landed in [[Vigan]] and then proceeded towards Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc.  As they sailed along the coast, they were surprised to see numerous sheltered [[cove]]s (''looc'') where the locals lived in harmony.  As a result, they named the region \"Ylocos\" and its people \"Ylocanos\".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs the [[Christianization]] of the region grew, so did the landscape of the area.  Vast tracts of land were utilized for churches and bell towers in line with the Spanish mission of {{lang|es|bajo de las campanas}} ('under the bells') \u2013 a proclamation by King Philip's 1573 [[Law of the Indies]]. In the town plaza, it was not uncommon to see garrisons under the church bells.  The colonization process was slowly being carried out.\n\nThe [[Spanish occupation of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]] of the region, however, was never completely successful. Owing to the abusive practices of many [[Augustinian friars]], a number of Ilocanos revolted against their colonizers.  Noteworthy of these were the Dingras uprising (1589) and Pedro Almasan revolt in San Nicolas (1660).  In 1762, [[Diego Silang]] led a series of battles aimed at freeing the Ilocanos from the Spanish yoke.  When he died from an assassin's bullet, his widow Gabriela continued the cause.  Unfortunately, she too was captured and hanged. In 1807, the [[sugar cane]] (''basi'') brewers of Piddig rose up in arms to protest the government's monopoly of the wine industry.  In 1898, the church excommunicated Gregorio Aglipay for refusing to cut off ties with the revolutionary forces of Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].  Unperturbed, he established the {{lang|es|Iglesia Filipina Independiente|italic=no}}.  Aglipay's movement and the national sentiment it espoused helped restore the self-respect of many [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].\n[[File:A street of Laoag, the capital of Ilocos Norte, 1900-1913.jpg|thumb|left|A street of Laoag, the capital of Ilocos Norte, 1900\u20131913]]\n\"The great increase in population from 1715 to 1818 from 18,980 to 282,845 made the administration of the province very difficult. Due to the excessive monopolies and forced labor, there were several uprisings: first by the people of Dingras in 1589; one that was led by Pedro Almazan in 1616; the revolt of [[Diego Silang]] in 1762\u20131763; by Ambaristo in 1788; by Pedro Mateo in 1808 (also known as [[Basi Revolt]]) and uprising of Sarrat in 1815. For this reason, the division of the Ilocos into two provinces was recommended by the local authorities. On February 2, 1818, a Spanish Royal Decree was promulgated dividing the Province of [[Ilocos Norte]] from [[Ilocos Sur]]. Laoag City, which was then the biggest center of population, was made the capital of Ilocos Norte.\"<ref>http://inorte.org/?page_id=2948</ref>\n\nThough Laoag was converted into a city in 1965 through a [[plebiscite]], leaving its municipal status, it remained the capital of [[Ilocos Norte]].

It is within two hours of jet travel to any one of  East Asia's economic tigers such as [[Hong Kong]], [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]] by way of the [[Laoag International Airport]] if direct routes are opened and established.<ref name=\"Geographical Location\"/> Having critical infrastructure such as the [[Laoag International Airport]] at Gabu and the Currimao Port makes Laoag the port of entry of goods and services complemented by an extensive road and highway system that connects it to other cities. An banking system is also found in the city with an  number of twenty-five different local, domestic, and foreign banks ready to serve any financial needs.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nWith a 12,747.35m total land area, Laoag City provides a large opportunity for economic expansion. The historic scenic tourist spots, availability of internationally competitive accommodations and facilities, and the presence of supportive national government agencies, makes Laoag an ecotourism center, as classified by the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]]. The Northwestern Luzon Growth Quadrangle \u2013 fondly called the North Quad \u2013 also aims to develop rural areas through an integrated countryside agri-industrial development approach with emphasis/focus in attaining sustainable and equitable growth; increase the productivity of agriculture and fisheries; encourage industrial competitiveness in the local and foreign markets like [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Plans are also being undertaken for the establishment of an [[ecotourism|eco-tourism]] village, which will showcase the rich cultural heritage of the [[Ilocano people]] and the local industries.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nLaoag and the surrounding municipalities also bolster a strong workforce. At present, most industries in the city are small-scale, consisting of small-scale food-processing factories, rice mills, jewelry-making, hollow blocks factories, and metal crafts.\n\nThe city is also in the forefront of green-technology after [[Danes|Danish]] investors set-up the first wind-driven powerplant in [[Southeast Asia]]: the [[Bangui Wind Farm]]. The 25-megawatt plant cost $47.6 million US dollars. An $11 million US dollar expansion is concurrently under construction, which is set to quadruple the capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.industcards.com/wind-asia.htm|title=Bangui windmills|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:Ilocos Norte Provincial Capitol 02.jpg|thumb|Ilocos Norte Provincial Capitol]]\n[[File:Laoag City Hall (front).jpg|thumb|Laoag City Hall]]\n\nLaoag City elected officials, term of office June 30, 2019 \u2013 June 30, 2022:<ref name=comelec>{{cite web |url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/?r=Archives/RegularElections/2013NLE/Results/citymuni2013 |title=Official City/Municipal 2013 Election Results |publisher=Commission on Elections (COMELEC) |location=Intramuros, Manila, Philippines |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=row| Mayor\n| [[Michael Marcos Keon]]\n|-\n! scope=row |Vice Mayor\n| Vicentito M.

A recent surge in [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] tourists have been flocking to splurge in the city's profitable casino located inside the only 5-star hotel in northern [[Philippines]]: [[Fort Ilocandia Hotel and Resort]]. Other places of interest include a tour of heritage sites featuring Spanish colonial buildings, [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] churches, [[La Paz Sand Dunes]], white-sand beach resorts of [[Pagudpud]], and Marcos-era mansions.\n\nThe [[Laoag Cathedral]] was built in 1612 by [[Augustinians|Augustinian friars]] to replace a wooden [[chapel]]. It also serves as the seat or central church of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Laoag]]. Built with an [[Italian Renaissance]], the church has an unusual two-storey [[fa\u00e7ade]], supported by two pairs of [[column]]s on each side of the arched entrance architecture design and at the top of the facade holds a recessed [[niche (architecture)|niche]] that showcases the image of the city's [[patron saint]], [[William of Maleval]].\n\nThe dramatic increase in tourist arrivals also prompted the establishment of a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] consulate to oversee the security of Chinese citizens living or visiting the city. A new immigration policy set to simplify entry of Chinese tourists into the country by issuing visitor visas in the airport after arrival is expected to entice more guests to come. To supplement the anticipated growth in tourist-related business activity, the government of [[Ilocos Norte]] has started construction on a multimillion-dollar convention center and hotel to supply the demand and diversify services. Laoag City has been named as one of the top tourist destinations in [[Ilocos Region|Region I]] and in the country.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Gilbert Bridge, Laoag City, Ilocos Norte, Philippines.jpg|thumb|Gilbert Bridge spanning across the Padsan River]]\n\n[[Laoag International Airport]] services flights to and from [[Guangzhou]] and [[Macau]], as well as, domestic flights by [[Philippine Airlines]]. Foreign airlines offer direct charter flights to Laoag as part of travel packages with optional excursions to tourist sites outside of the city. Tourists can find travel agencies all over including ticket offices of several airlines in the airport terminal.\n\nSeveral large bus companies serve Laoag City making connections to major and minor Philippines destinations. These transportation services are provided by [[GV Florida Transport]], Maria de Leon Bus Lines, RCJ Lines, [[Partas]], [[Farinas Transit Company]]. Laoag is {{convert|487|km}} from [[Manila]].\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Laoag Central Elementary School.jpg|thumb|Laoag Central Elementary School]]\n\nAs the provincial capital, Laoag is the center of social and economic activity with almost all major commercial and institutional establishments gravitating towards it. The importance of [[Education in the Philippines|education]] in socializing its population is shared by both the local government and the private sector, which has invested heavily in the development of the academic infrastructure. The city is home to public and private schools offering elementary, secondary, and tertiary education programs. Current Philippine law requires free compulsory education to the general population from elementary to high school, as well as, subsidized tertiary education in state-ran institutions. Alternative private schools offering parallel programs to government schools are also found with additional programs to cater to students with various needs. These schools are an important component of the educational system and reflect the city's diversity as they include [[Chinese school]]s, [[Catholic school]]s, [[single-gender education|single-gender]] boarding schools, and [[military school]]s.\n\nMost of the lower-level schools are government-owned and are divided into three districts, comprising a total of thirty-three primary and elementary schools. Seven private elementary schools are also present, however, most are sectarian and run by religious organizations. In addition, there are eight private and three public high schools, although the latter has  significantly higher number of attendees. The Department of Education, Division of Laoag City is currently supervised by Ms. Aracelli C. Pastor.\n\nIn order to provide continuing education to sustain the economic momentum of the region, the government has established tertiary public learning institutions in the city: the College of Teacher Education (CTE) and the College of Industrial Technology (CIT) of the [[Mariano Marcos State University]].\n\nIn addition, private colleges and universities are also found in the city, each with their own specialization.

Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] and capital of the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}.\n\nIt is the province's political, commercial, and industrial hub and the location of the Ilocos Region's busiest [[Laoag International Airport|commercial airport]].\n\nThe municipalities of [[San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte|San Nicolas]], [[Paoay, Ilocos Norte|Paoay]], [[Sarrat, Ilocos Norte|Sarrat]], [[Vintar, Ilocos Norte|Vintar]], and [[Bacarra, Ilocos Norte|Bacarra]] form its boundaries. The foothills of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] mountain range to the east, and the [[West Philippine Sea]] to the west are its physical boundaries.\n\nLaoag experiences the prevailing [[monsoon]] climate of Northern [[Luzon]], characterized by a dry season from November to April and a wet season from May to October, occasionally visited by powerful [[typhoon]]s.\n\n==History==\nLong before the coming of the Spaniards, there already existed an extensive region consisting of the present provinces of [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Abra (province)|Abra]] and [[La Union]] renowned for its gold mines.  Merchants from [[Japan]] and [[China]] would often visit the area to trade gold with beads, ceramics and silk.  The [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] inhabitants of the region called their place ''samtoy'', from ''sao mi itoy'', which literally meant \"this is our language.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1571, when the [[Spanish conquistadors]] had [[Manila]] more or less under their control, they began looking for new sites to conquer. Legaspi's grandson, Juan de Salcedo, volunteered to lead one of these expeditions.  Together with eight armed boats and 45 men, the 22-year-old voyager headed north.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nOn June 13, 1572, Salcedo and his men landed in [[Vigan]] and then proceeded towards Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc.  As they sailed along the coast, they were surprised to see numerous sheltered [[cove]]s (''looc'') where the locals lived in harmony.  As a result, they named the region \"Ylocos\" and its people \"Ylocanos\".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs the [[Christianization]] of the region grew, so did the landscape of the area.  Vast tracts of land were utilized for churches and bell towers in line with the Spanish mission of {{lang|es|bajo de las campanas}} ('under the bells') \u2013 a proclamation by King Philip's 1573 [[Law of the Indies]]. In the town plaza, it was not uncommon to see garrisons under the church bells.  The colonization process was slowly being carried out.\n\nThe [[Spanish occupation of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]] of the region, however, was never completely successful. Owing to the abusive practices of many [[Augustinian friars]], a number of Ilocanos revolted against their colonizers.  Noteworthy of these were the Dingras uprising (1589) and Pedro Almasan revolt in San Nicolas (1660).  In 1762, [[Diego Silang]] led a series of battles aimed at freeing the Ilocanos from the Spanish yoke.  When he died from an assassin's bullet, his widow Gabriela continued the cause.  Unfortunately, she too was captured and hanged. In 1807, the [[sugar cane]] (''basi'') brewers of Piddig rose up in arms to protest the government's monopoly of the wine industry.  In 1898, the church excommunicated Gregorio Aglipay for refusing to cut off ties with the revolutionary forces of Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].  Unperturbed, he established the {{lang|es|Iglesia Filipina Independiente|italic=no}}.  Aglipay's movement and the national sentiment it espoused helped restore the self-respect of many [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].\n[[File:A street of Laoag, the capital of Ilocos Norte, 1900-1913.jpg|thumb|left|A street of Laoag, the capital of Ilocos Norte, 1900\u20131913]]\n\"The great increase in population from 1715 to 1818 from 18,980 to 282,845 made the administration of the province very difficult. Due to the excessive monopolies and forced labor, there were several uprisings: first by the people of Dingras in 1589; one that was led by Pedro Almazan in 1616; the revolt of [[Diego Silang]] in 1762\u20131763; by Ambaristo in 1788; by Pedro Mateo in 1808 (also known as [[Basi Revolt]]) and uprising of Sarrat in 1815. For this reason, the division of the Ilocos into two provinces was recommended by the local authorities. On February 2, 1818, a Spanish Royal Decree was promulgated dividing the Province of [[Ilocos Norte]] from [[Ilocos Sur]]. Laoag City, which was then the biggest center of population, was made the capital of Ilocos Norte.\"<ref>http://inorte.org/?page_id=2948</ref>\n\nThough Laoag was converted into a city in 1965 through a [[plebiscite]], leaving its municipal status, it remained the capital of [[Ilocos Norte]].

It is within two hours of jet travel to any one of  East Asia's economic tigers such as [[Hong Kong]], [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]] by way of the [[Laoag International Airport]] if direct routes are opened and established.<ref name=\"Geographical Location\"/> Having critical infrastructure such as the [[Laoag International Airport]] at Gabu and the Currimao Port makes Laoag the port of entry of goods and services complemented by an extensive road and highway system that connects it to other cities. An banking system is also found in the city with an  number of twenty-five different local, domestic, and foreign banks ready to serve any financial needs.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nWith a 12,747.35m total land area, Laoag City provides a large opportunity for economic expansion. The historic scenic tourist spots, availability of internationally competitive accommodations and facilities, and the presence of supportive national government agencies, makes Laoag an ecotourism center, as classified by the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]]. The Northwestern Luzon Growth Quadrangle \u2013 fondly called the North Quad \u2013 also aims to develop rural areas through an integrated countryside agri-industrial development approach with emphasis/focus in attaining sustainable and equitable growth; increase the productivity of agriculture and fisheries; encourage industrial competitiveness in the local and foreign markets like [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Plans are also being undertaken for the establishment of an [[ecotourism|eco-tourism]] village, which will showcase the rich cultural heritage of the [[Ilocano people]] and the local industries.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nLaoag and the surrounding municipalities also bolster a strong workforce. At present, most industries in the city are small-scale, consisting of small-scale food-processing factories, rice mills, jewelry-making, hollow blocks factories, and metal crafts.\n\nThe city is also in the forefront of green-technology after [[Danes|Danish]] investors set-up the first wind-driven powerplant in [[Southeast Asia]]: the [[Bangui Wind Farm]]. The 25-megawatt plant cost $47.6 million US dollars. An $11 million US dollar expansion is concurrently under construction, which is set to quadruple the capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.industcards.com/wind-asia.htm|title=Bangui windmills|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:Ilocos Norte Provincial Capitol 02.jpg|thumb|Ilocos Norte Provincial Capitol]]\n[[File:Laoag City Hall (front).jpg|thumb|Laoag City Hall]]\n\nLaoag City elected officials, term of office June 30, 2019 \u2013 June 30, 2022:<ref name=comelec>{{cite web |url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/?r=Archives/RegularElections/2013NLE/Results/citymuni2013 |title=Official City/Municipal 2013 Election Results |publisher=Commission on Elections (COMELEC) |location=Intramuros, Manila, Philippines |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=row| Mayor\n| [[Michael Marcos Keon]]\n|-\n! scope=row |Vice Mayor\n| Vicentito M.

A recent surge in [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] tourists have been flocking to splurge in the city's profitable casino located inside the only 5-star hotel in northern [[Philippines]]: [[Fort Ilocandia Hotel and Resort]]. Other places of interest include a tour of heritage sites featuring Spanish colonial buildings, [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] churches, [[La Paz Sand Dunes]], white-sand beach resorts of [[Pagudpud]], and Marcos-era mansions.\n\nThe [[Laoag Cathedral]] was built in 1612 by [[Augustinians|Augustinian friars]] to replace a wooden [[chapel]]. It also serves as the seat or central church of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Laoag]]. Built with an [[Italian Renaissance]], the church has an unusual two-storey [[fa\u00e7ade]], supported by two pairs of [[column]]s on each side of the arched entrance architecture design and at the top of the facade holds a recessed [[niche (architecture)|niche]] that showcases the image of the city's [[patron saint]], [[William of Maleval]].\n\nThe dramatic increase in tourist arrivals also prompted the establishment of a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] consulate to oversee the security of Chinese citizens living or visiting the city. A new immigration policy set to simplify entry of Chinese tourists into the country by issuing visitor visas in the airport after arrival is expected to entice more guests to come. To supplement the anticipated growth in tourist-related business activity, the government of [[Ilocos Norte]] has started construction on a multimillion-dollar convention center and hotel to supply the demand and diversify services. Laoag City has been named as one of the top tourist destinations in [[Ilocos Region|Region I]] and in the country.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Gilbert Bridge, Laoag City, Ilocos Norte, Philippines.jpg|thumb|Gilbert Bridge spanning across the Padsan River]]\n\n[[Laoag International Airport]] services flights to and from [[Guangzhou]] and [[Macau]], as well as, domestic flights by [[Philippine Airlines]]. Foreign airlines offer direct charter flights to Laoag as part of travel packages with optional excursions to tourist sites outside of the city. Tourists can find travel agencies all over including ticket offices of several airlines in the airport terminal.\n\nSeveral large bus companies serve Laoag City making connections to major and minor Philippines destinations. These transportation services are provided by [[GV Florida Transport]], Maria de Leon Bus Lines, RCJ Lines, [[Partas]], [[Farinas Transit Company]]. Laoag is {{convert|487|km}} from [[Manila]].\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Laoag Central Elementary School.jpg|thumb|Laoag Central Elementary School]]\n\nAs the provincial capital, Laoag is the center of social and economic activity with almost all major commercial and institutional establishments gravitating towards it. The importance of [[Education in the Philippines|education]] in socializing its population is shared by both the local government and the private sector, which has invested heavily in the development of the academic infrastructure. The city is home to public and private schools offering elementary, secondary, and tertiary education programs. Current Philippine law requires free compulsory education to the general population from elementary to high school, as well as, subsidized tertiary education in state-ran institutions. Alternative private schools offering parallel programs to government schools are also found with additional programs to cater to students with various needs. These schools are an important component of the educational system and reflect the city's diversity as they include [[Chinese school]]s, [[Catholic school]]s, [[single-gender education|single-gender]] boarding schools, and [[military school]]s.\n\nMost of the lower-level schools are government-owned and are divided into three districts, comprising a total of thirty-three primary and elementary schools. Seven private elementary schools are also present, however, most are sectarian and run by religious organizations. In addition, there are eight private and three public high schools, although the latter has  significantly higher number of attendees.
