Ten of these eleven universities have been established in the states of [[ICFAI University, Dehradun|Uttarakhand]], Tripura, Jharkhand,  Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim (ICFAI Sikkim provides [[Master of Business Administration]] through correspondence mode as well), WEST BENGAL, Meghalaya, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh through acts passed by the legislative assemblies of the respective states.

On 25 May 2012, both the parties decided to resolve this long pending dispute and have entered into an agreement under which ICFAI will stop providing the CFA Charter.\n\nThis will allow both the parties to mutually co-exist and pursue their business objectives. ICFAI would continue to operate under the ICFAI brand but will begin phasing out the CFA designation over the next few years.

A single judge and a Division Bench dismissed them. The present appeal is directed against this judgment. ICFAI assailed the notification contending that it was violative of a person's fundamental right to practise any profession guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution. \nOn May 16, 2007 the above notification was quashed by The Honourable Supreme Court of India.<ref>{{cite map|title = The Hindu: National: Court quashes ICAI notification|url = http://www.hindu.com/2007/05/23/stories/2007052303381300.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Supreme Court allows CAs to pursue CFA Charter in the name MIFA degree from ICFAI & become CFA's ===\nThere was a bar by the ICAI - the apex Indian body for Chartered Accountancy from pursuing or joining INDIAN CFA of Icfai university,\nAfter nearly two decades, the ICFAI (Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India) has won the 'chartered' row against the ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India).\nIn a decision dated May 16, 2007, the court ruled in favour of ICFAI, by setting aside an earlier verdict of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which had allowed the ICAI to prohibit its members from using the description 'Chartered Financial Analyst' or its abbreviation CFA.\n\n=== Future of ICFAI and CFA ===\nICFAI, having been embroiled in a long legal battle with the CFA Institute, focused its energy on developing private universities, some of which have AICTE recognition along with UGC recognition. ICFAI has focussed all its energies away from developing its CFA charter like giving it statutory recognition increasing its status as a high status profession like that of CA from ICAI, which was announced by the governing member NJ Yeshasway who vowed to take up the CFA Charter a notch above the legendary CA exam considered to be the toughest in the realm of finance, but instead has opened a host of non-CFA programs like MBA, ICFAI Business Schools (IBS), PG Programs which have scaled up into national top 10 place in India. It has also opened schools for under graduate programs and offering degrees. Indian CFAs pass with a stringent eligibility to qualify as CFAs but have only a niche finance sector as the job market unlike CA which has traditional roles of Auditing and taxation along with statutory roles.\nCFAs work in investment related and finance fields where MBAs (some from ICFAI itself), CAs, Master's degree holders of Statistics, Economics, Doctorates etc. hold top posts.\nICFAI though has safeguarded its CFA charter in India with valid state legislature under IUT Tripura Act, but CFA charterholders are not mandatorily employable and currently don't perform any statutory duty unlike CAs, CSs, CWAs, though CCFA tried to accomplish this in investment related areas in India by submitting a draft bill to the ministry of finance for consideration which was rejected due to various legal disputes that ICFAI faces.

As a result, there is negativity about this course in the Indian corporate world. Keeping in view the demands from the corporate world and impending competition, ICFAI is thinking of bringing wholesale changes in the curriculum and the training method from the current academic year. The new course can only be completed in 24 months and will include a training program for the passing students of final exam. ICFAI is also creating a window for students of CFA program to undergo 2 months internship with its in-house concerns to impart rigorous analytical skills. Exemption for MBAs will be stopped from the current academic year. Also, ICFAI is drafting a continuing professional development module which will be compulsory for all the current CFAs. This program will enable the current CFAs to enhance their knowledge in their respective areas and will include relevant statutes changes, paradigm shift in capital markets and allied subject matter. ICFAI hopes to regain the old status of its CFA program through continuously evolving methods, the most recent is focussing on the core aspects of investment management and financial analysis in its MFA degree(current CFA syllabus) and increasing CFA charter membership by giving official charters to students who have cleared the core subjects of investment management and financial analysis of the previous(CFA curriculum) MS Finance program.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Hyderabad, India]]\n[[Category:1984 establishments in India]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1984]]\n[[Category:Professional certification in finance]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2015}}\n{{Primary sources|date=April 2009}}\n\n[[File:Atul Singh addressing the gathering at ICFAI University1.jpg|thumb|Atul Singh addressing a gathering at ICFAI]]\nThe '''Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India''' ('''ICFAI''') was established in 1984 as a not-for-profit educational society in [[Telangana]], [[India]].
