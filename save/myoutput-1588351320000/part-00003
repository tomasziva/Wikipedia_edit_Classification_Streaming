In that period Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli came under the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Empire]], either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the [[Barbary States]]. Similar raids were undertaken from [[Republic of Bou Regreg|Sal\u00e9]] and other ports in [[Morocco]].\n\nBarbary corsairs captured thousands of merchant ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns. As a result, residents abandoned their former villages of long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy.

They, and two less well-known brothers all became Barbary corsairs in the service of the Ottoman Empire; they were called the Barbarossas (Italian for Redbeards) after the red beard of Oru\u00e7, the eldest. Oru\u00e7 captured the island of Djerba for the Ottoman Empire in 1502 or 1503. He often attacked Spanish territories on the coast of North Africa; during one failed attempt in 1512 he lost his left arm to a cannonball. The eldest Barbarossa also went on a rampage through Algiers in 1516, and captured the town with the help of the Ottoman Empire. He executed the ruler of Algiers and everybody he suspected would oppose him, including local rulers. He was finally captured and killed by the Spanish in 1518, and put on display.\n\n====H\u0131z\u0131r Hayreddin Barbarossa====\n{{Main|Hayreddin Barbarossa}}\n[[File:Barbaros minyat\u00fcr.jpg|thumb|Ottoman admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]\nOru\u00e7, based mainly on land, was not the best-known of the Barbarossas.

He dyed the hair of his head and beard with [[Henna#Hair dye|henna]] to redden it like Oru\u00e7's. After capturing many crucial coastal areas, Hayreddin was appointed admiral-in-chief of the Ottoman sultan's fleet. Under his command the Ottoman Empire was able to gain and keep control of the eastern Mediterranean for over thirty years.

Ward was a privateer for Queen Elizabeth during her war with Spain; after the end of the war, he became a corsair. With some associates he captured a ship in about 1603 and sailed it to Tunis; he and his crew converted to [[Islam]]. He was successful and became rich. He introduced heavily armed [[Square rig|square-rigged ships]], used instead of galleys, to the North African area, a major reason for the Barbary's future dominance of the Mediterranean.

In Morocco, she gathered a crew largely of exiled [[Moors]], and launched pirate expeditions against Spain and Portugal to avenge the Reconquista, protect Morocco from Christian pirates, and seek riches and glory. She co-founded the Barbary Corsairs with her allies the Barbarossa brothers, who divided the Mediterranean between them\u2014the Barbarossas and their Ottoman fleet operating in the [[Eastern Mediterranean|east]], and Sayyida al-Hurra and her Moorish and North-African pirates operating in the [[Western Mediterranean|west]]. Sayyida al-Hurra became wealthy and renowned enough for the Sultan of Morocco, [[Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad|Ahmad al-Wattasi]] to make her his queen. Notably, however, she refused to marry in his capital of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], and would not get married but in T\u00e9touan, of which she was governor.

[[Miguel de Cervantes]], the Spanish author, was captive for five years as a slave in the ''[[bagnio]]'' of Algiers, and reflected his experience in some of his fictional (but not directly autobiographical) writings, including the Captive's tale in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', his two plays set in Algiers, ''El Trato de Argel'' (The Treaty of Algiers) and ''Los Ba\u00f1os de Argel'' (The Baths of Algiers), and episodes in a number of other works. In [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' (a [[Singspiel]]), two European ladies are discovered in a Turkish harem, presumably captured by Barbary corsairs.

This area was known in [[Europe]] as the [[Barbary Coast]], a term derived from the name of its [[Berbers|ethnically Berber]] inhabitants. Their predation extended throughout the [[Mediterranean]], south along [[West Africa]]'s [[Atlantic]] seaboard and into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] as far north as [[Turkish Abductions|Iceland]], but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing [[Merchant vessel|merchant ships]], they engaged in ''[[Ghazw|Razzias]]'', raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in the British Isles,<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> the Netherlands, and Iceland.<ref name=Toll/> The main purpose of their attacks was [[slavery|slaves]] for the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman slave trade]] as well as the general [[Arab slave trade|Arab slavery market]] in North Africa and the Middle East.

In that period Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli came under the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Empire]], either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the [[Barbary States]]. Similar raids were undertaken from [[Republic of Bou Regreg|Sal\u00e9]] and other ports in [[Morocco]].\n\nBarbary corsairs captured thousands of merchant ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns. As a result, residents abandoned their former villages of long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy. Between 100,000 and 250,000 Iberians were enslaved by these raids.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe raids were such a problem coastal settlements were seldom undertaken until the 19th century. Between 1580 and 1680 corsairs were said to have captured about 850,000 people as slaves and from 1530 to 1780 as many as 1,250,000 people were enslaved.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" /> However, these numbers have been questioned by the historian David Earle.<ref name=\"Earle\" /> Some of these corsairs were European outcasts and [[Religious conversion|converts]] (renegade) such as [[Jack Ward|John Ward]] and [[Zymen Danseker]].<ref name=Toll>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Toll-t.html Review of ''Pirates of Barbary''] by Ian W.

However, the ships and coasts of Christian states without such effective protection continued to suffer until the early 19th century. Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814\u201315, European powers agreed upon the need to suppress the Barbary corsairs entirely and the threat was largely subdued. Occasional incidents occurred, including two [[Barbary wars]] between the [[United States]] and the Barbary States, until finally terminated by the [[French conquest of Algeria]] in 1830.\n\n==History==\nIn 1198 the problem of Berber piracy and slave-taking was so great that the [[Trinitarians]], a religious order, were founded to collect ransoms and even to exchange themselves as ransom for those captured and pressed into slavery in North Africa.  In the 14th century Tunisian corsairs became enough of a threat to provoke a Franco-Genoese attack on Mahdia in 1390, also known as the \"[[Barbary Crusade]]\". [[Morisco]] exiles of the [[Reconquista]] and Maghreb pirates added to the numbers, but it was not until the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the arrival of the privateer and admiral [[Kemal Reis]] in 1487 that the Barbary corsairs became a true menace to shipping from European Christian nations.<ref>Pryor (1988), p. 192</ref>\n\n[[File:Captain walter croker horror stricken at algiers 1815.jpg|thumb|British captain witnessing the miseries of Christian slaves in Algiers, 1815]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] the pirates attacked American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean.

Those who survived the journeys were often forced to walk through town as they were taken to slave auctions. The slaves typically had to stand from eight in the morning until two in the afternoon while buyers viewed them.\nNext came the auction, where the townspeople would bid on the captives they wanted to purchase and once that was over, the governor of Algiers (the Dey) had the chance to purchase any slave he wanted for the price they were sold at the auction. During the auctions the slaves would be forced to run and jump around to show their strength and stamina. After purchase, the captives would either be held for ransom, or be put to work. Slaves were used for a wide variety of jobs, from hard manual labor to housework (the job assigned to most women slaves). At night the slaves were put into prisons called ''''[[bagnio]]s'''<nowiki>'</nowiki> (derived from the Italian word ''\"bagno\"'' for ''public bath'', inspired by the Turks' use of Roman baths at Constantinople as prisons),<ref name=\"BAGNO\">[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bagnio ''Definition of \"bagnio\" from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary''].

He often attacked Spanish territories on the coast of North Africa; during one failed attempt in 1512 he lost his left arm to a cannonball.

This was the first and only time in history that a Moroccan monarch had married away from his capital.\n\n===Other famous Barbary corsairs===\n[[File:Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli.jpg|thumb|[[Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni]]s Headquarter in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]].]]\n[[File:Raisuli.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni]], the last of the Barbary Pirates.]]\n* [[Kemal Reis]] (c. 1451\u20131511)\n* [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]] (died 1482)\n* [[Sinan Reis]] (died 1546)\n* [[Piri Reis]] (died 1554 or 1555)\n* [[Turgut Reis]] (1485\u20131565)\n* [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] (died 1553)\n* [[Kurto\u011flu Muslihiddin Reis]] (1487\u2013c. 1535)\n* [[Kurto\u011flu H\u0131z\u0131r Reis]]\n* [[Salih Reis]] (c. 1488\u20131568)\n* [[Seydi Ali Reis]] (1498\u20131563)\n* [[Piyale Pasha]] (c. 1515\u20131578)\n* [[Ra\u00efs Hamidou]] (1773\u20131815)\n* [[Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis]] (1519\u20131587)\n* [[Ali Bitchin]] (c. 1560\u20131645)\n* [[Simon de Danser]] or ''Simon Reis'' (c. 1579\u2013c. 1611)\n* [[Salomo de Veenboer]] or ''Sulayman Reis'' (died 1620)\n* [[Murat Reis the Elder]] (c. 1534\u20131638)\n* [[Jan Janszoon|Murat Reis the Younger]] (c. 1570\u2013after 1641)\n\n==In fiction==\n[[File:Livorno, Monumento dei quattro mori a Ferdinando II (1626) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 13-4-2006 12.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Livorno#Monumento dei quattro mori|Quattro Mori]]'' (\"Four Moors\") by [[Pietro Tacca]]; [[Livorno]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nBarbary corsairs are protagonists in ''[[Le pantere di Algeri]] (the panthers of Algiers)'' by [[Emilio Salgari]]. They were featured in a number of other noted novels, including ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' by [[Daniel Defoe]], ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], ''[[The Sea Hawk]]'' and the ''Sword of Islam'' by [[Rafael Sabatini]], ''[[The Algerine Captive]]'' by [[Royall Tyler]], ''[[Aubrey-Maturin series#Master and Commander|Master and Commander]]'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]], the ''[[Baroque Cycle]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]], ''[[The Walking Drum]]'' by [[Louis Lamour]], ''[[Doctor Dolittle]]'' by [[Hugh Lofting]], ''[[Corsair (Cussler novel)|Corsair]]'' by [[Clive Cussler]] and ''[[Angelique (French series)|Ang\u00e9lique in Barbary]]'' by [[Anne Golon]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the Spanish author, was captive for five years as a slave in the ''[[bagnio]]'' of Algiers, and reflected his experience in some of his fictional (but not directly autobiographical) writings, including the Captive's tale in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', his two plays set in Algiers, ''El Trato de Argel'' (The Treaty of Algiers) and ''Los Ba\u00f1os de Argel'' (The Baths of Algiers), and episodes in a number of other works. In [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' (a [[Singspiel]]), two European ladies are discovered in a Turkish harem, presumably captured by Barbary corsairs. [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s opera ''[[L'Italiana in Algeri]]'' is based on the capture of several slaves by Barbary corsairs led by the [[bey]] of [[Algiers]].\n\nOne of the stereotypical features of a pirate as portrayed in popular culture, the [[Eyepatch|eye patch]], may have been partially derived from the [[Arab]] corsair [[Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah]], who wore a patch after losing an eye in battle in the 18th century.<ref>Charles Belgrave (1966), ''The Pirate Coast'', p. 122, [[George Bell & Sons]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Albanian piracy]]\n* [[Anglo-Turkish piracy]]\n* [[Barbary Slave Trade]]\n* [[Barbary treaties]]\n* [[Circassian beauties]]\n* [[Ghazw]]\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Imperial Harem]] \n* [[List of Ottoman sieges and landings]]\n* [[Morisco]]\n* [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]]\n* [[Ottoman Navy]]\n* [[Republic of Bou Regreg]]\n* [[Romegas]]\n* [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire]]\n* [[Turkish Abductions]]\n* [[Morocco\u2013United States relations]]\n{{Commons category|Barbary Corsairs}}\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Clissold, Stephen. 1976. \"Christian Renegades and Barbary Corsairs.\" ''History Today'' 26, no. 8: 508\u2013515.
