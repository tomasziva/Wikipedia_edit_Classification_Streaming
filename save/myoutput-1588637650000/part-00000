While the other members were not too sure about Kusterbeck, Harnage convinced them she was right for the job and she soon joined the band in 2007.<ref>FBR Plus: Other Videos: VE Q&A<http://fbrplus.com/></ref> Little did they know that Kusterbeck lied about her age saying she was 18 years old, when she was really 16, so she could get an audition. However, Kusterbeck later cleared this misunderstanding and explained that it was more of a mix up; she was turning 17 a week from the audition, and she said to Harnage on the phone, \"I'm 17, my birthday is in a week\". This was misconstrued to mean she was already 17, and was turning 18, however she actually meant she would be 17 in a week.<ref>RAW Interviews: Paragraph 1<http://csrawinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/sierra-anthony-from-versaemerge.html></ref>\nAfter the recruit of Kusterbeck, VersaEmerge played local home shows and went on tour with bands such as Kiros, Our Last Night, There for Tomorrow, and Craig Owens.<ref>RAW Interviews: Question 4<http://csrawinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/sierra-anthony-from-versaemerge.html></ref> The band worked hard and released their first EP with Kusterbeck, ''[[Perceptions (EP)|Perceptions]]'', in May 2008. They then parted with rhythm guitarist James Lano, who was then replaced by Jerry Pierce. VersaEmerge later signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]]. They began to write their self-titled EP, recording with producer James Paul Wisner. The EP was released February 3, 2009. Rumors stirred of music videos for in Pursuing Design and The Authors, two songs on the EP. In late 2011, the video for in Pursuing Design was leaked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtMqc3hWpT8|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> A month after the leak, VersaEmerge still has not commented on its unplanned release.\n\nAfter the release of the [[VersaEmerge (EP)|self-titled EP]], VersaEmerge went on \"The Secret Valentine Tour\" with headlining bands [[We the Kings]], [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]], [[The Cab]], and [[There for Tomorrow]].<ref>WTK Fansite: Secret Valentine Tour<http://wethekings.fangap.com/Home/tabid/29663/EntryId/10422/-The-Secret-Valentine-Tour-w-The-Cab-The-Maine-There-For-Tomorrow-VersaEmerge-Pre-Sale.aspx></ref> After the Secret Valentine Tour, VersaEmerge grew a larger fan base and got picked to play 2 of 4 dates of the [[Give It a Name]] 2009 festival in the United Kingdom with bands such as Taking Back Sunday, Underoath, Thursday, Escape the Fate, and Innerpartysystem. They returned to the United States and almost immediately left for Bamboozle in New Jersey. When they returned to their homes in Florida, they began writing for their LP for a few months before leaving for Warped Tour '09. After The Warped Tour, they headed to Malibu to record and write for their LP, then packed up for the OP tour featuring headliner [[Boys Like Girls]], and co-headliners [[Cobra Starship]], The Maine, and [[A Rocket to the Moon]].<ref>They Will Rock You<http://theywillrockyou.com/2009/08/boys-girls-announce-love-drunk-tour-cobra-starship-maine/></ref>\n\nOn September 19, 2009, drummer and co-founding member, Anthony Martone, announced his split with the band through his Twitter saying \"I'm no longer in VersaEmerge. Thanks for all your support. I am currently a drummer for hire, thanks everyone...\" After about a week of fan speculation in regards to Martone's sudden departure, bassist Devin Ingelido and the band posted blogs about their parting with Martone, stating the split was due to personal reasons that will not be elaborated on. The band hired musician and friend Spencer Peterson (not to be confused with the band's former vocalist, Spencer Pearson) to fill in as a temporary replacement on drums for the OP tour. On November 22, 2009, guitarist Jerry Pierce announced on Twitter that he will be leaving the band due to personal reasons concerning his family. He cleared up that he remains friends with the other members, however he \"just can't keep touring as much as [VersaEmerge] does.\" Jerry played his last show with the band on November 28, 2009.<ref>JerryPierceVE Twitter updates on 21/11/09 to 28/11/09 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090812025512/http://twitter.com/JerryPierceVE]</ref> They released their debut album right before the 2010 Vans Warped Tour.

A clip of \"Fixed at Zero\" was also posted on the website www.fixedatzero.com. On April 28, 2010, fixedatzero.com posted the album cover, and pre-order information, with a release date of June 22, 2010, for the album. VersaEmerge went out to support the release of the album by playing [[The Bamboozle#May 1 lineup 2|The Bamboozle]] on May 1, 2010, playing alongside such bands as label-mates [[Paramore]] as well as [[Weezer]]. They also co-headlined a tour with [[I See Stars]] in the mid spring.\n\nVersaEmerge completed their second full run on the [[Vans Warped Tour]] that began June 25, 2010, in California. They played the [[Glamour Kills]] Stage the entire tour. Kusterbeck also played a game called ''Where the Fuck is Sierra?'' with fans on every date of the tour. The game was similar to hide and seek and the first ten fans to find her received a winning card which was also a cut the line pass for their signing. On July 27, 2010, the band released the music video for the title track and first single from ''[[Fixed at Zero]]'' on their Myspace page. It was later made available on YouTube. On September 13, 2010, VersaEmerge announced that they would be headlining a tour in Fall '10 called the Vultures Unite Tour. They were joined by [[Anarbor]], [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]] and [[Conditions (band)|Conditions]]. The tour hit small venues across the US and also had two Canadian dates. It was claimed to be a \"cinematic experience\". [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]] left the tour due to an altercation between Ingelido and members of [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]], as well as previous issues disclosed on Kusterbeck's Tumblr page.\n\nThe band appeared on the MTV documentary show ''[[World of Jenks]]'' on October 18, 2010. After the episode aired, VersaEmerge's fan base had grown substantially. On December 10, 2010, [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] announced that VersaEmerge would be one of five bands on the 2011 Spring [[Alternative Press Tour]]. Joined by VersaEmerge are [[Black Veil Brides]], [[Conditions (band)|Conditions]], [[Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows|D.R.U.G.S.]] and [[I See Stars]]. In December 2010, former drummer Anthony Martone posted a personal account explaining his departure from the band, revealing that his tendencies to butt heads with Kusterbeck prompted his dismissal. On April 26, 2011, band member Devin Ingelido announced he was leaving the band to spend more time with his wife and newborn son.<ref name=devin>{{Cite web|url=http://www.upvenue.com/article/1351-versaemerge-announce-departure-of-bassist.html|title=VersaEmerge Announce Departure of Bassist}}</ref> His last show was on May 7, 2011.<ref>[http://versaemergemusic.com/post/4964940715 VersaEmerge \u2022 Hello Vultures It is with sadness that we would<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nick Osborne (2005\u20132006) will be replacing him on bass for the UK/Euro Invasion tour.

While the other members were not too sure about Kusterbeck, Harnage convinced them she was right for the job and she soon joined the band in 2007.<ref>FBR Plus: Other Videos: VE Q&A<http://fbrplus.com/></ref> Little did they know that Kusterbeck lied about her age saying she was 18 years old, when she was really 16, so she could get an audition. However, Kusterbeck later cleared this misunderstanding and explained that it was more of a mix up; she was turning 17 a week from the audition, and she said to Harnage on the phone, \"I'm 17, my birthday is in a week\". This was misconstrued to mean she was already 17, and was turning 18, however she actually meant she would be 17 in a week.<ref>RAW Interviews: Paragraph 1<http://csrawinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/sierra-anthony-from-versaemerge.html></ref>\nAfter the recruit of Kusterbeck, VersaEmerge played local home shows and went on tour with bands such as Kiros, Our Last Night, There for Tomorrow, and Craig Owens.<ref>RAW Interviews: Question 4<http://csrawinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/sierra-anthony-from-versaemerge.html></ref> The band worked hard and released their first EP with Kusterbeck, ''[[Perceptions (EP)|Perceptions]]'', in May 2008. They then parted with rhythm guitarist James Lano, who was then replaced by Jerry Pierce. VersaEmerge later signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]]. They began to write their self-titled EP, recording with producer James Paul Wisner. The EP was released February 3, 2009. Rumors stirred of music videos for in Pursuing Design and The Authors, two songs on the EP. In late 2011, the video for in Pursuing Design was leaked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtMqc3hWpT8|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> A month after the leak, VersaEmerge still has not commented on its unplanned release.\n\nAfter the release of the [[VersaEmerge (EP)|self-titled EP]], VersaEmerge went on \"The Secret Valentine Tour\" with headlining bands [[We the Kings]], [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]], [[The Cab]], and [[There for Tomorrow]].<ref>WTK Fansite: Secret Valentine Tour<http://wethekings.fangap.com/Home/tabid/29663/EntryId/10422/-The-Secret-Valentine-Tour-w-The-Cab-The-Maine-There-For-Tomorrow-VersaEmerge-Pre-Sale.aspx></ref> After the Secret Valentine Tour, VersaEmerge grew a larger fan base and got picked to play 2 of 4 dates of the [[Give It a Name]] 2009 festival in the United Kingdom with bands such as Taking Back Sunday, Underoath, Thursday, Escape the Fate, and Innerpartysystem. They returned to the United States and almost immediately left for Bamboozle in New Jersey. When they returned to their homes in Florida, they began writing for their LP for a few months before leaving for Warped Tour '09. After The Warped Tour, they headed to Malibu to record and write for their LP, then packed up for the OP tour featuring headliner [[Boys Like Girls]], and co-headliners [[Cobra Starship]], The Maine, and [[A Rocket to the Moon]].<ref>They Will Rock You<http://theywillrockyou.com/2009/08/boys-girls-announce-love-drunk-tour-cobra-starship-maine/></ref>\n\nOn September 19, 2009, drummer and co-founding member, Anthony Martone, announced his split with the band through his Twitter saying \"I'm no longer in VersaEmerge. Thanks for all your support. I am currently a drummer for hire, thanks everyone...\" After about a week of fan speculation in regards to Martone's sudden departure, bassist Devin Ingelido and the band posted blogs about their parting with Martone, stating the split was due to personal reasons that will not be elaborated on. The band hired musician and friend Spencer Peterson (not to be confused with the band's former vocalist, Spencer Pearson) to fill in as a temporary replacement on drums for the OP tour. On November 22, 2009, guitarist Jerry Pierce announced on Twitter that he will be leaving the band due to personal reasons concerning his family. He cleared up that he remains friends with the other members, however he \"just can't keep touring as much as [VersaEmerge] does.\" Jerry played his last show with the band on November 28, 2009.<ref>JerryPierceVE Twitter updates on 21/11/09 to 28/11/09 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090812025512/http://twitter.com/JerryPierceVE]</ref> They released their debut album right before the 2010 Vans Warped Tour.

A clip of \"Fixed at Zero\" was also posted on the website www.fixedatzero.com. On April 28, 2010, fixedatzero.com posted the album cover, and pre-order information, with a release date of June 22, 2010, for the album. VersaEmerge went out to support the release of the album by playing [[The Bamboozle#May 1 lineup 2|The Bamboozle]] on May 1, 2010, playing alongside such bands as label-mates [[Paramore]] as well as [[Weezer]]. They also co-headlined a tour with [[I See Stars]] in the mid spring.\n\nVersaEmerge completed their second full run on the [[Vans Warped Tour]] that began June 25, 2010, in California. They played the [[Glamour Kills]] Stage the entire tour. Kusterbeck also played a game called ''Where the Fuck is Sierra?'' with fans on every date of the tour. The game was similar to hide and seek and the first ten fans to find her received a winning card which was also a cut the line pass for their signing. On July 27, 2010, the band released the music video for the title track and first single from ''[[Fixed at Zero]]'' on their Myspace page. It was later made available on YouTube. On September 13, 2010, VersaEmerge announced that they would be headlining a tour in Fall '10 called the Vultures Unite Tour. They were joined by [[Anarbor]], [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]] and [[Conditions (band)|Conditions]]. The tour hit small venues across the US and also had two Canadian dates. It was claimed to be a \"cinematic experience\". [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]] left the tour due to an altercation between Ingelido and members of [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]], as well as previous issues disclosed on Kusterbeck's Tumblr page.\n\nThe band appeared on the MTV documentary show ''[[World of Jenks]]'' on October 18, 2010. After the episode aired, VersaEmerge's fan base had grown substantially. On December 10, 2010, [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] announced that VersaEmerge would be one of five bands on the 2011 Spring [[Alternative Press Tour]]. Joined by VersaEmerge are [[Black Veil Brides]], [[Conditions (band)|Conditions]], [[Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows|D.R.U.G.S.]] and [[I See Stars]]. In December 2010, former drummer Anthony Martone posted a personal account explaining his departure from the band, revealing that his tendencies to butt heads with Kusterbeck prompted his dismissal. On April 26, 2011, band member Devin Ingelido announced he was leaving the band to spend more time with his wife and newborn son.<ref name=devin>{{Cite web|url=http://www.upvenue.com/article/1351-versaemerge-announce-departure-of-bassist.html|title=VersaEmerge Announce Departure of Bassist}}</ref> His last show was on May 7, 2011.<ref>[http://versaemergemusic.com/post/4964940715 VersaEmerge \u2022 Hello Vultures It is with sadness that we would<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Nick Osborne (2005\u20132006) will be replacing him on bass for the UK/Euro Invasion tour.
