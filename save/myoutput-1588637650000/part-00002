The album was released through [[Epitaph Records]] on February 24, 2015. However, on February 17, the full album stream was uploaded to fallinginreverse.com. It is the last album to feature lead guitarist [[Jacky Vincent]] who announced his departure in late 2015. The album featured the return of the band's former sound, after their previous album, [[Fashionably Late (Falling in Reverse album)|Fashionably Late]], featured more of a crunk and rap sound. The album is the first to be recorded without an official bassist, with Charles Kallaghan Massabo playing bass on the record.\n\n==Reception==\n\nOverall, the album received generally favorable reviews, and was much more well-received then the band's previous album, ''[[Fashionably Late (Falling in Reverse album)|Fashionably Late]]''.  It received an overall review of 72/100 on Metacritic. Some critics labelled it as the band's best album, others also adding that it is the best work that Ronnie Radke has written. The album was widely hyped up to be \"Dying is Your Latest Fashion\" (Ronnie Radke's first album with the band [[Escape the Fate]]) Part 2 and Alternative Press said that \"Falling In Reverse have given fans the rare gift of an artist stepping back to the sound they originally fell in love with.\" Giving it a rating of 90/100. Revolver Magazine also gave it a great review of 90/100 saying \"Post-hardcore fans will certainly enjoy what is Falling in Reverse\u2019s strongest record to date.\"Others agreed as well,but not as strongly, with Sputnik Music saying that it was \"the best Falling in Reverse songs\" but with \"a few exceptions\", giving it the rather average score of 66/100.\n\nMultiple critics did not look so kindly upon the album with the ''[[Kerrang!]]'' rock magazine giving the back-handed compliment of that \"Just Like You is a good album, in that it contains many more good songs than bad ones.\" With the magazine giving the unsatisfactory score of 60/100. One critic from Punknews.com was rather more straight forward in their review giving the line that it \"Seems like a deliberate maintenance to cash in on the Warped Tour crowd because there's no substance, nor any style, to this record, as has been the case for FIR for years now.\" Giving it the very low score of 10/100.\n\nThe album was included at number 50 on ''Rock Sound''{{'}}s top 50 releases of 2015 list.<ref>Bird, ed. 2016, p. 22</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = [[Ronnie Radke]], Michael 'Elvis' Baskette and Charles 'Kallaghan' Massabo; except where noted\n| total_length = 45:00\n| headline = Standard edition\n| title1 = Chemical Prisoner\n| length1 = 4:20\n| title2 = God, If You Are Above ...\n| length2 = 3:36\n| title3 = Sexy Drug\n| length3 = 3:14\n| title4 = [[Just Like You (Falling in Reverse song)|Just Like You]]\n| length4 = 3:32\n| title5 = [[Guillotine IV (The Final Chapter)]]\n| note5 = Radke, Massabo, [[Jacky Vincent]]\n| length5 = 3:35\n| title6 = Stay Away\n| note6 = Radke, Baskette, Thomas Denny\n| length6 = 3:21\n| title7 = Wait and See\n| note7 = Radke, Massabo\n| length7 = 4:38\n| title8 = The Bitter End\n| length8 = 4:03\n| title9 = My Heart's To Blame\n| note9 = Radke, Massabo\n| length9 = 3:49\n| title10 = Get Me Out\n| length10 = 3:45\n| title11 = Die For You\n| note11 = Radke, Massabo, [[Derek Jones (musician)|Derek Jones]]\n| length11 = 3:44\n| title12 = Brother\n| note12 = Radke, Ryan Ogren\n| length12 = 3:21\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n|total_length    = 52:22\n|headline = Digital and Target deluxe edition<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/just-like-you-deluxe-edition/id952788045|title=Falling In Reverse - Pre-orders \"Just Like You\" |publisher=iTunes |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n| title13 = My Apocalypse II\n| length13 = 3:45\n| title14 = Pray\n| length14 = 3:37\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n\"Just Like You\" album personnel as listed on [[AllMusic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/just-like-you-mw0002819211/credits |title=Just Like You by Falling in Reverse on.
