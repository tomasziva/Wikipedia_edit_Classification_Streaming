{"title_page": "Characters in The Railway Series", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}\n{{primary sources|date=January 2014}}\n}}\nMany characters have appeared in the books of ''[[The Railway Series]]'' by the [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev. Wilbert Awdry]] and [[Christopher Awdry]], and in the spin-off television series, ''[[Thomas and Friends]]''. Only characters who appear in the books have been profiled in this article and in the case where a character has appeared in both series, only the book aspect has been addressed.{{TOC right}}\n\n==Sir Topham Hatt's railway==\nThese are the railway locomotives (known universally in the books as 'engines') of the [[Fat Controller]]'s railway: the [[North Western Railway (fictional)|North Western Railway]] (NWR) on the [[Sodor (fictional island)|Island of Sodor]].\n\n===Steam engines===\n\n====Thomas==== \n{{Main|Thomas the Tank Engine}}\n\n'''Thomas the Tank Engine''' is a [[0-6-0]] tank locomotive, based on the [[LB&SCR E2 Class]]. He is painted blue with red lining and is No.1 in the North Western Railway fleet.  Thomas was told to work on the mainline was built in 1915 and arrived on Sodor in May 1922.\n\nHe is a rather cheeky, but kind and clever engine who does his work without fussing and believes himself to be extremely clever on the main lines.\nThomas is also a main character in the eponymous television series, ''Thomas and Friends''.\n\n====Edward====\n{{Main|Edward the Blue Engine}}\n\n'''Edward the Blue Engine''' is a [[Furness Railway K2]] [[4-4-0]] [[tender locomotive|tender engine]], the first character to appear in ''The Railway Series''. He is painted blue with red stripes and is No.2 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is one of the oldest engines on the railway, as well as very kind and is a friend to everyone. He was built in 1896 and arrived on Sodor in 1915.\n\nEdward is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Henry====\n{{Main|Henry the Green Engine}}\n\n'''Henry the Green Engine''' is a [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0]] tender engine. He is painted green with red stripes and is No.3 in the North Western Railway fleet. After a major accident with the Flying Kipper, Henry was rebuilt with a different boiler and a new Belpaire firebox (though the firebox is never identified as a Belpaire, its shape is distinctive, and Crewe, where Henry was sent for rebuilding, was well known for such boiler and firebox conversions). He is one of the biggest engines (like Gordon), and although he is a hard worker at heart, can be quite highly-strung at times. He was built circa 1919, arrived on Sodor in 1922, and was rebuilt in 1935.\n\nHenry is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Gordon====\n{{Main|Gordon the Big Engine}}\n\n'''Gordon the Big Engine''' is a [[LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3|LNER Gresley A1 Pacific]] prototype [[4-6-2]] tender engine. He is painted blue with red stripes and is No.4 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is the biggest engine on the railway, and usually pulls the Express from the \"Big Station\" to the \"Top Station\". He is also very boastful and proud, but good at heart. He was built in 1922, arrived on Sodor in 1923, and rebuilt in 1939.\n\nGordon is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\nGordon is named after a rude boy that lived on the Awdry's street when Christopher was a child.\n\n====James====\n{{Main|James the Red Engine}}\n\n'''James the Red Engine''' is a [[Mixed-traffic locomotive|mixed-traffic]] [[L&YR Class 28]] 'Mogul' [[2-6-0]] tender engine. He is painted red with gold stripes & dome and is No.5 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is quite vain and hot-headed, and loves showing off his red paint. Despite this, he is good-hearted and kind. He was built around 1912/13 and arrived on Sodor in 1923.\n\nJames is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\nIt is debatable whether James arrived on the Island of Sodor in 1948 or 1925, because in the Author's Note of 'James the Red Engine', it states nationalization has already happened.\n\n====Percy====\n{{Main|Percy the Small Engine}}\n\n'''Percy the Small Engine''' is a [[0-4-0]] [[saddle tank (locomotive)|saddle tank]] engine of indeterminate origins and being partly based on the [[GWR No. 1340 Trojan]]. He is painted green with red stripes and is No.6 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is a cheeky little engine and sometimes plays jokes on the bigger engines. He also has a strong sense of adventure, a high work rate and doesn't let anyone push him around, which sometimes gets him into trouble. He was built sometime around the 1900s or 1930s and arrived on Sodor sometime before 1935 during a railway strike.\n\nPercy is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Toby====\n{{Main|Toby the Tram Engine}}\n\n''Toby the Tram Engine'' is a [[0-6-0]] [[GER Class C53]] [[steam]] [[tram]] engine who works on the same [[branch line]] as [[#Thomas|Thomas]]. He is painted brown and blue and is number 7 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is a wise, experienced engine who knows all there is to know about running a branch line. He was built in 1914 and arrived on Sodor in 1951.\n\nToby's [[cowcatcher]]s and [[sideplates]] (that cover his wheels) mean he is ideal for taking stone trucks to and from the quarry at [[Ffarquhar]], as the railway runs close to the road. Toby has his own coach, [[#Henrietta|Henrietta]], who is painted chocolate brown and loves passengers.\n\nToby is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Duck==== \n{{Main|Duck the Great Western Engine}}\n\n''Duck the Great Western Engine'' (real name ''Montague'') is a [[0-6-0]] [[GWR 5700 Class]] [[pannier tank]] locomotive. He is painted in [[Great Western Railway|Great Western]] green and is officially number 8 in the North Western Railway fleet, although he carries a cast GWR number plate on his cab sides (5741). He currently runs his own branch line, [[North Western Railway (fictional)#The Little Western|The Little Western]]. He is a loyal hard worker who believes that \"there are two ways to do things: the Great Western way, and the wrong way.\" He was built in 1929 and arrived on Sodor in 1955. Prior to his arrival on Sodor, he worked at [[London Paddington station|Paddington]]. This fact is revealed in the story \"Gordon goes Foreign\".\n\n====Donald and Douglas====\n{{Main|Donald and Douglas}}\n\n''Donald and Douglas'' are identical [[0-6-0]] tender engines who came from Scotland on trial. Not wanting to be separated, and knowing that one of them would have been scrapped on remaining in Scotland, they decided to travel together and hope for the best. Although [[the Fat Controller]] was only expecting one engine and intended to send the other back to Scotland, he changed his mind after hearing how they performed in the snow and decided to keep both engines in his fleet.\n\nThe 'Twin Engines', as they became known, were painted all-over black on arrival at the island, but are then painted in blue with red stripes to match Gordon, Edward and Thomas. Donald & Douglas were given the numbers 9 and 10 respectively, as well as nameplates. They are practical, cheeky and no-nonsense engines who can be relied upon for any task. They were built in 1899 and arrived on Sodor in 1959.\n\nDonald and Douglas are based on the [[Caledonian Railway 812 Class]] locomotives.\n\n====Oliver====\n''[[Oliver the Western Engine]]'' is a [[0-4-2]] [[tank engine|tank locomotive]] who 'escaped' from [[the Other Railway]] where he was due to be scrapped. He first appears in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Enterprising Engines|''Enterprising Engines'']], where his rescue by [[#Donald & Douglas|Douglas]] is described.  Also escaping with Oliver were his faithful coaches, a [[GWR Autocoach|GWR autocoach]] called [[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel|Isabel]], and a GWR brake van named '[[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Toad the Brake Van|Toad]]'. His daring escape made him popular with the engines, which perhaps made him a little overconfident. He was built in 1934 and arrived on Sodor in 1968. Bocos Brother D5701 was one of the diesels looking for Oliver when Oliver hid on that old quarry branch but never caught him, later arriving at Barrow-in-Furness due to running out of coal and water until Douglas saved him.\n\nAfter arriving on Sodor, Oliver was restored, painted [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] green, and allocated loco number 11 on the North Western Railway books.  However, he was allowed to keep his GWR number '1436'. He was assigned to work with [[Duck the Great Western Engine|Duck]] on his branch line, \"''[[North Western Railway (fictional)#The Little Western|The Little Western]]''\", hauling Isabel and a second autocoach, [[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel|Dulcie]], both of whom have also been restored to full GWR livery.\n\nWhen Oliver arrived on Sodor, he was not used to handling trucks, as he had operated a passenger branchline up until this point. While shunting his first [[track ballast|ballast]] train, an incident resulted in Oliver landing bunker-down in a [[turntable (railroad)|turntable]] well.  On his return from the Works, the trucks continually harassed him, teasing about his accident with an irritating song- \"Oliver's No Use At ALL!\". With Toad's help, Oliver learned how to deal with them (albeit after having pulled one truck apart! - see ''[[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Scruffey|S.C.Ruffey]]'' for the full story). Since then, he has gained experience and sense.\n\nOliver is based on a [[GWR 1400 Class]] 0-4-2T tank locomotive. These engines were fitted with a mechanical system allowing the driver to control the locomotive remotely from the cab of an [[GWR Autocoach|'autocoach']], such as [[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel|Isabel]].\n\nThe story of Oliver's 'escape' is related by the Rev. W. Awdry in [[List of Railway Series Books#The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways|''The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways'']].\n\nOliver has appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Enterprising Engines|''Enterprising Engines'']] and, of course, the stories in the next book in the series, [[List of Railway Series Books#Oliver the Western Engine|''Oliver the Western Engine'']]. He had a cameo appearance in the next volume, after which he was not seen again until [[List of Railway Series Books#Henry and the Express|''Henry and the Express'']].\n\nOliver was named after Oliver Wicks \u2013 Awdry's next door neighbour in Rodborough, Stroud \u2013 who was a much respected member of Stroud Baptist Church.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}<!-- fact relates to whole paragraph, not just whether he was a member of Stroud Baptist Church!-->\n\n====Bill and Ben====\n{{for2|the characters in Thomas & Friends|[[Railway engines (Thomas and Friends)#Bill and Ben|Bill & Ben (TV Series)]]}}\n''Bill and Ben'' are twin [[Locomotive#Steam|tank engines]] who work for the Sodor China Clay Company. They are painted dark orange, have four wheels each and have their names attached to their sides on brown nameplates. Apart from their nameplates, they are absolutely identical\u2014which can be confusing to engines who don't know them well. They are smaller than the other engines they work with. They were built in 1948 and arrived on Sodor sometime in the 1960s. \n\nThey are young and cheeky and love playing jokes on the big engines, but are kept in order by [[#Edward|Edward]] and [[#BoCo|BoCo]]. They work in the [[china clay]] quarry and at [[Fictional locations in The Railway Series#Brendam|Brendam]] Docks, where they are kept busy [[shunting]] trucks.\n\nBill & Ben are based on two [[0-4-0]] tank engines built by [[W.G. Bagnall|Bagnall]]'s of [[Stafford]]. They worked at [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] in [[Cornwall]] and were named [[Bagnall 0-4-0ST \"Alfred\" and \"Judy\"|Alfred and Judy]]. They are unusually low, allowing them to fit under bridges that taller engines could not. The real examples are both preserved at the [[Bodmin and Wenford Railway]].\n\nThey first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Main Line Engines|''Main Line Engines'']] and played a major role in [[List of Railway Series Books#Thomas and the Twins|''Thomas and the Twins'']].\n\nIn the television series, they are nearly twice the size of the engines upon which they are based.\n\n===Diesel engines===\n\n====Diesel====\n{{Main|The Other Railway#Diesel}}\n\n====Daisy====\n{{for2|the character in Thomas & Friends|[[Railway engines (Thomas and Friends)#Daisy|Daisy (TV series)]]}}\n''Daisy'' (real name ''B.U.T.'') is a unique [[Diesel engine|diesel]] [[railcar]], painted green with yellow lining (similar to the livery of [[British Railways]]' DMUs in the 1960s), and was built in 1960 and arrived on Sodor specially for use on the Ffarquhar branch of the North Western Railway. She first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Branch Line Engines|''Branch Line Engines'']].<ref name=IoSPHR_Daisy>{{cite book\n | last =The Rev. W. Awdry\n | authorlink = W. V. Awdry\n |author2=G Awdry\n | title =[[List of Railway Series Books#The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways|''The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways'']]\n | publisher = Kaye & Ward\n | year = 1987\n | page = 126\n | isbn  = 0-434-92762-7\n }}</ref>\n\nDaisy arrived on Sodor after [[#Thomas|Thomas]] had an accident and needed major repairs. She was lazy at first, refusing to do any work that didn't appeal to her and claiming that she was \"highly sprung\", and thought herself more clever than the other engines. But an incident with a bull and a stern warning from [[the Fat Controller]] showed her the error of her ways, and she is now a wiser and valuable addition to Thomas' branch line. She is numbered as D1 in the NWR fleet.\n\nDaisy is undoubtedly based on the [[British Rail Class 101|Class 101]] [[diesel multiple unit]]s (DMUs), but is a one-off, being a single railcar (akin to the [[British Rail Class 121|Class 121]] 'bubble cars'), with a driving cab at each end.  Although normally considered to be a Class 101, ''Daisy'' is always depicted with the distinctive valances around the [[buffer beam]]s that distinguishes the earlier [[British Rail Metro-Cammell|'light-weight' prototype units]] made by [[Metro-Cammell]]. This is because the original model was built by amalgamating two of Tri-ang's R157 models. This would also account for Daisy's refusal to pull a milk van to the dairy, as the lightweight units were not strong enough to haul wagons.\n\nDiesel engines like Daisy were becoming a common sight on [[branch line]]s during the early 60's, and therefore it can be implied that Daisy's introduction into the series is a reflection of the contemporary state of railways at the time. Some of the stories involving Daisy reflect problems that were faced by railway staff when it came to dealing with 'highly sprung' diesel engines in the earlier phases of their usurpment of steam.\n\n====BoCo====\n{{for|the character in the TV series|BoCo (Thomas and Friends)}}\n''BoCo'' (real name ''Crossley'') is a [[Co-Bo]] mixed traffic diesel who works mainly on [[#Edward|Edward]]'s Branch Line. He is painted in a light shade of green used by [[British Railways]] in the 1960s. He first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Main Line Engines|''Main Line Engines'']]. He was built in 1958 and arrived on Sodor in 1965.\n\nBoCo was received with some hostility by Bill and Ben, who called him a \"Diseasel\" due to a misunderstanding (the word \"Diseasel\" is also a [[portmanteau word]] combining the words \"Disease\" and \"Diesel\" and characters are heard commenting that \"Coughs and sneezles spread diseasels\"), and by James, who called him a \"buzzbox\". Edward accepted him right away, and soon the others were won over. BoCo is a kind-hearted engine who enjoys a good joke, and he is always ready with a good word when needed.\n\nBoCo is a [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] Type 2 {{BRC|28}} diesel-electric locomotive, named after its unusual Co-Bo wheel arrangement. The bogie beneath the power plant carries three powered axles ('Co') and the other carries two ('Bo'). This arrangement was designed to maximise the routes over which the engine could work. Another unusual feature of the Metrovick Co-Bo is the use of a two-stroke diesel power plant rather than the more standard four-stroke. They suffered from mechanical unreliability which, according to Christopher Awdry, The Fat Controller managed to cure in BoCo's case.\n\nTwenty of these engines were built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] in 1958 as part of British Railways' Modernisation Plan. One 'Metrovick' (D5705) has survived and is preserved at the [[East Lancashire Railway]] in Bury.\n\nBoCo's name is always spelt with a capital B and a capital C. The name, obviously, is derived from the fact that he is a Co-Bo diesel. Rev. W. Awdry decided that \"BoCo\" flowed better than \"CoBo\", and sounded more affectionate.\n\nIn the Railway Series, BoCo carries his North Western Railway number 'D2', whereas in the television series he carries the number D5702, which is in the range of numbers assigned to the real \"Metrovick\" locomotives by British Railways. In reality, D5702, built in October 1958, was withdrawn in September 1968 and cut up in November 1969.\nOne of BoCo's brothers, numbered D5701 was one of the diesels that was looking for Oliver back when Oliver was escaping from scrap. D5701 was withdrawn a few months after Oliver hid in an old quarry branch and scrapped the following year.\n\n====Bear/D7101====\n''Bear'' (real name ''Bristol Siddeley'') was originally known as ''D7101''.\n\nAs described in the books, D7101 first arrived on the Island of Sodor on a trial for The Fat Controller. He was accompanied by another diesel engine, [[The Other Railway#D199.2F.22Spamcan.22|D199]], who talked about taking over the railway, which D7101 didn't like. Later in the same story, D7101 suffered from a failed ejector and had to be rescued by Henry. He befriended his rescuer, and The Fat Controller decided to give him a second chance.  D7101 was given a new name, Bear, a new number, D3, and a new coat of paint, and D199 was sent away in disgrace.\n\nBear attracted his nickname because of the sound of his engine, which is loud and gives off a growling sound he can't help. Bear was one of the later additions to the ''Railway Series'' universe, built in 1964 and arriving in 1967. He is based on the [[British Rail Class 35]] \"Hymek\" [[AAR wheel arrangement#B-B|B-B]] [[diesel-hydraulic]] locomotive, first built in 1961.\n\nBear now pulls the Express. He wears the two-tone green livery he would have carried when built (all-over British Railways locomotive green, with a narrow band of a lighter, lime green along the bottom of the sides, cream-white cab window surrounds, and a small yellow warning panel). When he arrived he wore the [[British Rail]] '[[Rail Blue]]' livery.\n\nLike D199, The Bear's number, D7101, is fictional but plausible; the final Class 35 was numbered 'D7100'.\n\nHe first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Enterprising Engines|''Enterprising Engines'']] and he has several cameos, one very noticeable cameo is in the \"James And The Diesel Engine\" Story: \"Old Stuck-Up\" where he is shown with BoCo and the other engines in the shed.\n\n====Mavis====\n{{for2|the character in Thomas & Friends|[[Railway engines (Thomas and Friends)#Mavis|Mavis (TV series)]]}}\n''Mavis'' (real name ''Gardner'') is a [[0-6-0]] diesel-mechanical shunting engine. She belongs to the [[Ffarquhar]] Quarry Co. rather than the Fat Controller, and works mainly shunting stone trucks in their quarry. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} She sometimes brings Toby's trucks down the line when he is busy. She is painted black, with yellow-and-black \"hazard\" stripes on her radiator and cab back. Mavis is based on a BR [[British Rail Class 04|Class 04]], some of which were fitted with the sideplates and cow-catcher for use on the [[Wisbech and Upwell Tramway]], the same line that Toby came from. She was built by the Drewry Car Company <ref>{{cite web|title=The Wisbech and Upwell Tramway: Toby and Mavis|url=https://www.lner.info/co/GER/wisbech/toby_mavis.php|website=lner.info|publisher=LNER|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}</ref> and arrived on Sodor in 1962.\n\nWhen she was young, she was convinced that she knew it all and that Toby with his worn-in rules and methods was a \"fusspot\", but discovered that sometimes there is nothing wrong with taking advice - ignoring Toby's advice on truck-management-skills brought Mavis to a literal standstill at a level crossing near Ffarquhar where iced rails allowed the trucks to turn the tables on her. To Mavis' indignation rescue came in the form of 'fusspot' Toby. However  the two became friends when she rescued him from a collapsing bridge. She is now allowed to come down the line from time to time, and is a useful addition to the branch line.\n\nShe first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Tramway Engines|''Tramway Engines'']]. She was named after the Rev W. Awdry's neighbour in Rodborough, Stroud.\n\n====Pip and Emma====\n'''Pip and Emma''' (real names '''Phillipa and Emily''') are the two class 43 locomotives (or \"power cars\") which top and tail an [[InterCity 125]] High-Speed diesel trainset in [[The Railway Series]]. They had experienced problems with their cooling system and came to the railway when Gordon was on a journey. They soon made friends with all the engines.\n\nThey have had three appearances, one in [[List of Railway Series Books#Gordon the High Speed Engine|''Gordon the High-Speed Engine'']], and two others as main characters in [[List of Railway Series Books#Thomas and the Fat Controller's Engines|''Thomas and the Fat Controller's Engines'']] and [[List of Railway Series Books#Thomas and his Friends|''Thomas and His Friends'']]. Following [[Privatisation of British Rail|Privatisation]], the Fat Controller has decided to purchase them in order to run a faster service to London.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Awdry\n  | first =Christopher\n  | authorlink =Christopher Awdry\n  | title =Sodor, Reading Between the Lines\n  | publisher =Sodor Enterprises\n  | year =2005\n  | isbn =0-9549665-1-1\n  | id =\n  | page =9  }}</ref>\n\nPip and Emma are based on the [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|British Rail Class 43 HST]] painted in the original InterCity 125 livery of yellow and blue, and built in 1975. After being purchased by the Fat Controller in 2011, the words \"InterCity 125\" and the BR Logo which were painted on their sides were replaced by \"NWR\" and have red nameplates with yellow writing.\n\nPip and Emma are also the names of two sibling characters in the [[Agatha Christie]] novel ''[[A Murder is Announced]]''. The phrase \"[[wikt:pip emma|pip emma]]\" was also used in the [[wikt:signalese|signalese]] developed by the [[British Army]] [[signaller]]s in the [[First World War]] to mean ''[[post meridiem]]'', or p.m.\n\n===Rolling stock===\n\n====Annie and Clarabel====\n{{Main|Annie and Clarabel}}\n\n''Annie and Clarabel'' are [[#Thomas|Thomas]]' coaches and carry passengers on his branch line. They are his ''[[confidant]]es'' and friends.\n\n====Henrietta====\n{{main|Toby the Tram Engine#Henrietta|l1=Henrietta}}\n''Henrietta'' is Toby's four-wheeled [[Great Eastern Railway|GER]] non-articulated coach.\n\n====Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel====\n\n''Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel'' are Great Western autocoaches who work with Oliver (Isabel and Dulcie) and Duck (Alice and Mirabel) on the Little Western.\n\n==Skarloey Railway==\n{{Main|Skarloey Railway}}\n\nSkarloey Railway locomotives numbers 1 to 6 each have real-life equivalents, with the same numbers, on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\n===Skarloey===\n\n{{Main|Skarloey}}\n'''Skarloey''' (No. 1) is one of the oldest engines on the Island of Sodor. He is a wise and kind engine who knows everything there is to know about running a railway. He has great respect for coaches, passengers and his fellow engines, and often gives advice to the younger engines when it is needed. He also acts as a narrator in several of the stories.\n\nWhen he first arrived in 1865, he was proud and arrogant, and believed himself too good to pull trucks. He also suffered from a short wheelbase which made him unstable and gave him the nickname \"Bucking [[Bronco]]\". He was given an extra set of wheels and a cab, which made him pompous still. However, he was eventually shown the error of his ways. From then on, Skarloey became a hard worker, running the line with Rheneas until he was worn out.\n\nHe first appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']]. The story of his early years was told in [[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|''Very Old Engines'']].\n\n===Rheneas===\n\n{{Main|Rheneas}}\n'''Rheneas''' (No. 2) is one of the oldest engines on the Island of Sodor. Rheneas is known as the \"Gallant Old Engine\" because he saved the railway by getting a train home after a breakdown.\n\nHe was built in 1865 by [[Fletcher, Jennings & Co.|Fletcher, Jennings]] of Whitehaven, the same company that built Skarloey. He arrived shortly after Skarloey, but was at the start the more sensible of the two engines. He was a determined engine, and by the early 1950s he was running the railway alone. In [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']], he was sent away to be overhauled and did not return until seven books later, in [[List of Railway Series Books#Gallant Old Engine|''Gallant Old Engine'']].\n\n===Sir Handel===\n\n{{Main|Sir Handel}}\n'''Sir Handel''' (No. 3) is named after the owner of the Skarloey Railway, Sir Handel Brown. He worked on the [[Mid Sodor Railway]] under the name [[Mid Sodor Railway#Falcon|Falcon]]. He is a stubborn and pompous engine who thinks that pulling trucks is beneath him, and will do anything to get out of jobs he does not want to do.\n\nHe was built in 1904 at the [[Falcon Works]] in [[Loughborough]], and arrived on the Mid Sodor Railway in the same year, when he was painted blue and carried the name 'Falcon'. After that line closed, he was sold to the Sodor Aluminium Company and then to the [[Skarloey Railway]], which at the time was desperately short of locomotives. Sir Handel did not cope well with the neglected track on his new railway, and would often derail - sometimes deliberately. He was given special wheels with broad tyres to cure this problem, which were soon known as \"steamroller wheels\" by the other engines.\n\nIn the 1980s, he was invited to the [[Talyllyn Railway]]. This story actually had some basis in fact, as the Talyllyn Railway had paid tribute to the Railway Series by repainting their locomotive ''Sir Haydn'' to resemble Sir Handel. Sir Handel was actually based upon ''Sir Haydn''.\n\nIn the recent TV series, Sir Handel has a kind and wise personality like Skarloey, Rheneas, and Duke.\n\nSir Handel first appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']].\n\n===Peter Sam===\n\n{{Main|Peter Sam}}\n'''Peter Sam''' (No. 4) was known as [[Mid Sodor Railway#Stuart|Stuart]] when he worked on the [[Mid Sodor Railway]]. He is a polite engine, popular with passengers and coaches alike. Even the trucks do not play tricks on him.\n\nHe was built in 1920 for the Mid Sodor Railway by [[Kerr Stuart]] of Stoke-on-Trent, and was therefore given the name 'Stuart'. Like Sir Handel, he was later sold to the Sodor Aluminium Company and then to the Skarloey Railway. Following an accident with some slate trucks (set before the arrival of Duncan), he soon lost his funnel and was fitted with a [[Giesl ejector]] which made steaming far easier (set before Sir Handel got new wheels).\n\nIn the 1990s he was sent to the Talyllyn Railway. As with Sir Handel, this was based upon the Talyllyn Railway creating a \"lookalike\" engine, in this case by repainting the locomotive ''Edward Thomas''.\n\nHe first appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']].\n\n===Rusty===\n\n{{Main|Rusty the Diesel}}\n'''Rusty''' (No. 5) is a black [[diesel-mechanical]] locomotive built by the [[Ruston & Hornsby]] company from which he gets his name. He was acquired direct from the manufacturers in 1957.<ref name=SRBtL_SkarloeyRly>{{cite book\n | last  = Awdry\n | first = Christopher\n | authorlink = Christopher Awdry\n | title =[[List of Railway Series Books#Sodor: Reading Between the Lines|''Sodor: Reading Between the Lines'']]\n | publisher =Sodor Enterprises\n | year  = 2005\n | page = 13\n | isbn  = 0-9549665-1-1\n }}</ref> His equivalent engine on the Talyllyn Railway is ''Midlander''.\n\nHe is a reliable, practical and friendly little engine who mainly works on maintenance duties, although he can also pull passenger or goods trains if the need arises.\n\nHe arrived in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#The Little Old Engine|''The Little Old Engine'']].\n\n===Duncan===\n\n{{Main|Duncan (fictional locomotive)}}\n'''Duncan''' (No .6) is a well tank locomotive, built by [[Andrew Barclay Sons & Co.|Andrew Barclay]] of Kilmarnock in 1918, and arrived on Sodor in 1958.<ref name=SRBtL_SkarloeyRly/> He arrived on the railway [[second-hand]], as a replacement when Peter Sam had his accident at the quarry. He was rough and bad-mannered, and believed himself to be overworked. He would often sway and lurch along the track \u2013 what the Thin Controller referred to as \"[[rock 'n' roll]]\". He had a number of accidents as a result. Although he can still get grumpy, cheeky, and cynical, his behavior has greatly improved and he became a much nicer, respectable, more useful locomotive. His exact origins are unknown, but he did once work in a factory, according to Peter Sam.\n\nHe arrived in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#The Little Old Engine|''The Little Old Engine'']].\n\n==Non-Rail Characters==\n\n===Terence===\n\n{{Main|Terence the Tractor}}\n\n''Terence'' is a tractor who was first seen in 'Thomas, Terence and the Snow' in the book ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Tank Engine Thomas Again|Tank Engine Thomas Again]]'' (1949). He can go \"anywhere\" thanks to his caterpillar tracks and once famously helped Thomas out of a snowdrift. He was built in 1934.\n\n===Bertie===\n\n{{Main|Bertie the Bus}}\n''Bertie'' is the friendly bus that first appears in the story in which he rescues [[#Thomas|Thomas]]' passengers whilst in a snow drift, and has his most famous adventure when he challenges Thomas to a race. He likes to help whenever an engine can't take passengers.\n\n===Trevor the Traction Engine===\n\n{{Main|Trevor the Traction Engine}}\n\n''Trevor'' is a traction engine who was rescued in the story [[List of Railway Series Books#Edward the Blue Engine|'Saved from Scrap']] and spends most of his time working in the orchard alongside Edward's branch line. He is used for all sorts of odd jobs.\n\n===Harold===\n\n{{Main|Harold the Helicopter}}\n\n''Harold'' is a friendly helicopter to The Railway Series characters, although they share a friendly rivalry. He is owned by the Island's coastguard and lives at [[Fictional Locations (The Railway Series)#Dryaw|Dryaw Airfield]]. He was built in 1949 and appears in 1956.\n\n=='Human' Characters==\n\n===The Fat Controller===\n\n{{Main|The Fat Controller}}\n''Sir Topham Hatt'', The Fat Controller, is the head of the main rail company on [[Sodor (fictional island)|Sodor]]. He is a firm but fair leader for whom the engines have the greatest respect.\n\n==Minor characters==\nThe minor characters are described in the articles about the railways on which they operate:\n*[[Skarloey Railway]] characters\n*[[Culdee Fell Railway#Locomotives|Culdee Fell Railway locomotives]]\n*[[Arlesdale Railway#Locomotives|Arlesdale Railway locomotives]]\n*[[Mid Sodor Railway#Locomotives|Mid Sodor Railway locomotives]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Thomas}}\n\n[[Category:The Railway Series characters| Major]]\n[[Category:Fictional locomotives|Railway Series]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}\n{{primary sources|date=January 2014}}\n}}\nMany characters have appeared in the books of ''[[The Railway Series]]'' by the [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev. Wilbert Awdry]] and [[Christopher Awdry]], and in the spin-off television series, ''[[Thomas and Friends]]''. Only characters who appear in the books have been profiled in this article and in the case where a character has appeared in both series, only the book aspect has been addressed.{{TOC right}}\n\n==Sir Topham Hatt's railway==\nThese are the railway locomotives (known universally in the books as 'engines') of the [[Fat Controller]]'s railway: the [[North Western Railway (fictional)|North Western Railway]] (NWR) on the [[Sodor (fictional island)|Island of Sodor]].\n\n===Steam engines===\n\n====Thomas==== \n{{Main|Thomas the Tank Engine}}\n\n'''Thomas the Tank Engine''' is a [[0-6-0]] tank locomotive, based on the [[LB&SCR E2 Class]]. He is painted blue with red lining and is No.1 in the North Western Railway fleet.  Thomas was told to work on the mainline was built in 1915 and arrived on Sodor in May 1922.\n\nHe is a rather cheeky, but kind and clever engine who does his work without fussing and believes himself to be extremely clever on the main lines.\nThomas is also a main character in the eponymous television series, ''Thomas and Friends''.\n\n====Edward====\n{{Main|Edward the Blue Engine}}\n\n'''Edward the Blue Engine''' is a [[Furness Railway K2]] [[4-4-0]] [[tender locomotive|tender engine]], the first character to appear in ''The Railway Series''. He is painted blue with red stripes and is No.2 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is one of the oldest engines on the railway, as well as very kind and is a friend to everyone. He was built in 1896 and arrived on Sodor in 1915.\n\nEdward is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Henry====\n{{Main|Henry the Green Engine}}\n\n'''Henry the Green Engine''' is a [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0]] tender engine. He is painted green with red stripes and is No.3 in the North Western Railway fleet. After a major accident with the Flying Kipper, Henry was rebuilt with a different boiler and a new Belpaire firebox (though the firebox is never identified as a Belpaire, its shape is distinctive, and Crewe, where Henry was sent for rebuilding, was well known for such boiler and firebox conversions). He is one of the biggest engines (like Gordon), and although he is a hard worker at heart, can be quite highly-strung at times. He was built circa 1919, arrived on Sodor in 1922, and was rebuilt in 1935.\n\nHenry is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Gordon====\n{{Main|Gordon the Big Engine}}\n\n'''Gordon the Big Engine''' is a [[LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3|LNER Gresley A1 Pacific]] prototype [[4-6-2]] tender engine. He is painted blue with red stripes and is No.4 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is the biggest engine on the railway, and usually pulls the Express. He is also very boastful and proud, but good at heart. He was built in 1922, arrived on Sodor in 1923, and rebuilt in 1939.\n\nGordon is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\nGordon is named after a rude boy that lived on the Awdry's street when Christopher was a child.\n\n====James====\n{{Main|James the Red Engine}}\n\n'''James the Red Engine''' is a [[Mixed-traffic locomotive|mixed-traffic]] [[L&YR Class 28]] 'Mogul' [[2-6-0]] tender engine. He is painted red with gold stripes & dome and is No.5 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is quite vain and hot-headed, and loves showing off his red paint. Despite this, he is good-hearted and kind. He was built around 1912/13 and arrived on Sodor in 1923.\n\nJames is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\nIt is debatable whether James arrived on the Island of Sodor in 1948 or 1925, because in the Author's Note of 'James the Red Engine', it states nationalization has already happened.\n\n====Percy====\n{{Main|Percy the Small Engine}}\n\n'''Percy the Small Engine''' is a [[0-4-0]] [[saddle tank (locomotive)|saddle tank]] engine of indeterminate origins and being partly based on the [[GWR No. 1340 Trojan]]. He is painted green with red stripes and is No.6 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is a cheeky little engine with a strong sense of adventure, a high work rate and doesn't let anyone push him around, which sometimes gets him into trouble. He was built sometime around the 1900s or 1930s and arrived on Sodor sometime before 1935 during a railway strike.\n\nPercy is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Toby====\n{{Main|Toby the Tram Engine}}\n\n''Toby the Tram Engine'' is a [[0-6-0]] [[GER Class C53]] [[steam]] [[tram]] engine who works on the same [[branch line]] as [[#Thomas|Thomas]]. He is painted brown and blue and is number 7 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is a wise, experienced engine who knows all there is to know about running a branch line. He was built in 1914 and arrived on Sodor in 1951.\n\nToby's [[cowcatcher]]s and [[sideplates]] (that cover his wheels) mean he is ideal for taking stone trucks to and from the quarry at [[Ffarquhar]], as the railway runs close to the road. Toby has his own coach, [[#Henrietta|Henrietta]], who is painted chocolate brown.\n\nToby is also one of the main characters in the television series.\n\n====Duck==== \n{{Main|Duck the Great Western Engine}}\n\n''Duck the Great Western Engine'' (real name ''Montague'') is a [[0-6-0]] [[GWR 5700 Class]] [[pannier tank]] locomotive. He is painted in [[Great Western Railway|Great Western]] green and is officially number 8 in the North Western Railway fleet, although he carries a cast GWR number plate on his cab sides (5741). He currently runs his own branch line, [[North Western Railway (fictional)#The Little Western|The Little Western]]. He is a loyal hard worker who believes that \"there are two ways to do things: the Great Western way, and the wrong way.\" He was built in 1929 and arrived on Sodor in 1955. Prior to his arrival on Sodor, he worked at [[London Paddington station|Paddington]]. This fact is revealed in the story \"Gordon goes Foreign\".\n\n====Donald and Douglas====\n{{Main|Donald and Douglas}}\n\n''Donald and Douglas'' are identical [[0-6-0]] tender engines who came from Scotland on trial. Not wanting to be separated, and knowing that one of them would have been scrapped on remaining in Scotland, they decided to travel together and hope for the best. Although [[the Fat Controller]] was only expecting one engine and intended to send the other back to Scotland, he changed his mind after hearing how they performed in the snow and decided to keep both engines in his fleet.\n\nThe 'Twin Engines', as they became known, were painted all-over black on arrival at the island, but are then painted in blue with red stripes to match Gordon, Edward and Thomas. Donald & Douglas were given the numbers 9 and 10 respectively, as well as nameplates. They are practical, cheeky and no-nonsense engines who can be relied upon for any task. They were built in 1899 and arrived on Sodor in 1959.\n\nDonald and Douglas are based on the [[Caledonian Railway 812 Class]] locomotives.\n\n====Oliver====\n''[[Oliver the Western Engine]]'' is a [[0-4-2]] [[tank engine|tank locomotive]] who 'escaped' from [[the Other Railway]] where he was due to be scrapped. He first appears in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Enterprising Engines|''Enterprising Engines'']], where his rescue by [[#Donald & Douglas|Douglas]] is described.  Also escaping with Oliver were his faithful coaches, a [[GWR Autocoach|GWR autocoach]] called [[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel|Isabel]], and a GWR brake van named '[[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Toad the Brake Van|Toad]]'. His daring escape made him popular with the engines, which perhaps made him a little overconfident. He was built in 1934 and arrived on Sodor in 1968. Bocos Brother D5701 was one of the diesels looking for Oliver when Oliver hid on that old quarry branch but never caught him, later arriving at Barrow-in-Furness due to running out of coal and water until Douglas saved him.\n\nAfter arriving on Sodor, Oliver was restored, painted [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] green, and allocated loco number 11 on the North Western Railway books.  However, he was allowed to keep his GWR number '1436'. He was assigned to work with [[Duck the Great Western Engine|Duck]] on his branch line, \"''[[North Western Railway (fictional)#The Little Western|The Little Western]]''\", hauling Isabel and a second autocoach, [[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel|Dulcie]], both of whom have also been restored to full GWR livery.\n\nWhen Oliver arrived on Sodor, he was not used to handling trucks, as he had operated a passenger branchline up until this point. While shunting his first [[track ballast|ballast]] train, an incident resulted in Oliver landing bunker-down in a [[turntable (railroad)|turntable]] well.  On his return from the Works, the trucks continually harassed him, teasing about his accident with an irritating song- \"Oliver's No Use At ALL!\". With Toad's help, Oliver learned how to deal with them (albeit after having pulled one truck apart! - see ''[[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Scruffey|S.C.Ruffey]]'' for the full story). Since then, he has gained experience and sense.\n\nOliver is based on a [[GWR 1400 Class]] 0-4-2T tank locomotive. These engines were fitted with a mechanical system allowing the driver to control the locomotive remotely from the cab of an [[GWR Autocoach|'autocoach']], such as [[Minor characters in The Railway Series#Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel|Isabel]].\n\nThe story of Oliver's 'escape' is related by the Rev. W. Awdry in [[List of Railway Series Books#The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways|''The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways'']].\n\nOliver has appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Enterprising Engines|''Enterprising Engines'']] and, of course, the stories in the next book in the series, [[List of Railway Series Books#Oliver the Western Engine|''Oliver the Western Engine'']]. He had a cameo appearance in the next volume, after which he was not seen again until [[List of Railway Series Books#Henry and the Express|''Henry and the Express'']].\n\nOliver was named after Oliver Wicks \u2013 Awdry's next door neighbour in Rodborough, Stroud \u2013 who was a much respected member of Stroud Baptist Church.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}<!-- fact relates to whole paragraph, not just whether he was a member of Stroud Baptist Church!-->\n\n====Bill and Ben====\n{{for2|the characters in Thomas & Friends|[[Railway engines (Thomas and Friends)#Bill and Ben|Bill & Ben (TV Series)]]}}\n''Bill and Ben'' are twin [[Locomotive#Steam|tank engines]] who work for the Sodor China Clay Company. They are painted dark orange, have four wheels each and have their names attached to their sides on brown nameplates. Apart from their nameplates, they are absolutely identical\u2014which can be confusing to engines who don't know them well. They are smaller than the other engines they work with. They were built in 1948 and arrived on Sodor sometime in the 1960s. \n\nThey are young and cheeky and love playing jokes on the big engines, but are kept in order by [[#Edward|Edward]] and [[#BoCo|BoCo]]. They work in the [[china clay]] quarry and at [[Fictional locations in The Railway Series#Brendam|Brendam]] Docks, where they are kept busy [[shunting]] trucks.\n\nBill & Ben are based on two [[0-4-0]] tank engines built by [[W.G. Bagnall|Bagnall]]'s of [[Stafford]]. They worked at [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] in [[Cornwall]] and were named [[Bagnall 0-4-0ST \"Alfred\" and \"Judy\"|Alfred and Judy]]. They are unusually low, allowing them to fit under bridges that taller engines could not. The real examples are both preserved at the [[Bodmin and Wenford Railway]].\n\nThey first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Main Line Engines|''Main Line Engines'']] and played a major role in [[List of Railway Series Books#Thomas and the Twins|''Thomas and the Twins'']].\n\nIn the television series, they are nearly twice the size of the engines upon which they are based.\n\n===Diesel engines===\n\n====Diesel====\n{{Main|The Other Railway#Diesel}}\n\n====Daisy====\n{{for2|the character in Thomas & Friends|[[Railway engines (Thomas and Friends)#Daisy|Daisy (TV series)]]}}\n''Daisy'' (real name ''B.U.T.'') is a unique [[Diesel engine|diesel]] [[railcar]], painted green with yellow lining (similar to the livery of [[British Railways]]' DMUs in the 1960s), and was built in 1960 and arrived on Sodor specially for use on the Ffarquhar branch of the North Western Railway. She first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Branch Line Engines|''Branch Line Engines'']].<ref name=IoSPHR_Daisy>{{cite book\n | last =The Rev. W. Awdry\n | authorlink = W. V. Awdry\n |author2=G Awdry\n | title =[[List of Railway Series Books#The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways|''The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways'']]\n | publisher = Kaye & Ward\n | year = 1987\n | page = 126\n | isbn  = 0-434-92762-7\n }}</ref>\n\nDaisy arrived on Sodor after [[#Thomas|Thomas]] had an accident and needed major repairs. She was lazy at first, refusing to do any work that didn't appeal to her and claiming that she was \"highly sprung\", and thought herself more clever than the other engines. But an incident with a bull and a stern warning from [[the Fat Controller]] showed her the error of her ways, and she is now a wiser and valuable addition to Thomas' branch line. She is numbered as D1 in the NWR fleet.\n\nDaisy is undoubtedly based on the [[British Rail Class 101|Class 101]] [[diesel multiple unit]]s (DMUs), but is a one-off, being a single railcar (akin to the [[British Rail Class 121|Class 121]] 'bubble cars'), with a driving cab at each end.  Although normally considered to be a Class 101, ''Daisy'' is always depicted with the distinctive valances around the [[buffer beam]]s that distinguishes the earlier [[British Rail Metro-Cammell|'light-weight' prototype units]] made by [[Metro-Cammell]]. This is because the original model was built by amalgamating two of Tri-ang's R157 models. This would also account for Daisy's refusal to pull a milk van to the dairy, as the lightweight units were not strong enough to haul wagons.\n\nDiesel engines like Daisy were becoming a common sight on [[branch line]]s during the early 60's, and therefore it can be implied that Daisy's introduction into the series is a reflection of the contemporary state of railways at the time. Some of the stories involving Daisy reflect problems that were faced by railway staff when it came to dealing with 'highly sprung' diesel engines in the earlier phases of their usurpment of steam.\n\n====BoCo====\n{{for|the character in the TV series|BoCo (Thomas and Friends)}}\n''BoCo'' (real name ''Crossley'') is a [[Co-Bo]] mixed traffic diesel who works mainly on [[#Edward|Edward]]'s Branch Line. He is painted in a light shade of green used by [[British Railways]] in the 1960s. He first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Main Line Engines|''Main Line Engines'']]. He was built in 1958 and arrived on Sodor in 1965.\n\nBoCo was received with some hostility by Bill and Ben, who called him a \"Diseasel\" due to a misunderstanding (the word \"Diseasel\" is also a [[portmanteau word]] combining the words \"Disease\" and \"Diesel\" and characters are heard commenting that \"Coughs and sneezles spread diseasels\"), and by James, who called him a \"buzzbox\". Edward accepted him right away, and soon the others were won over. BoCo is a kind-hearted engine who enjoys a good joke, and he is always ready with a good word when needed.\n\nBoCo is a [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] Type 2 {{BRC|28}} diesel-electric locomotive, named after its unusual Co-Bo wheel arrangement. The bogie beneath the power plant carries three powered axles ('Co') and the other carries two ('Bo'). This arrangement was designed to maximise the routes over which the engine could work. Another unusual feature of the Metrovick Co-Bo is the use of a two-stroke diesel power plant rather than the more standard four-stroke. They suffered from mechanical unreliability which, according to Christopher Awdry, The Fat Controller managed to cure in BoCo's case.\n\nTwenty of these engines were built by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] in 1958 as part of British Railways' Modernisation Plan. One 'Metrovick' (D5705) has survived and is preserved at the [[East Lancashire Railway]] in Bury.\n\nBoCo's name is always spelt with a capital B and a capital C. The name, obviously, is derived from the fact that he is a Co-Bo diesel. Rev. W. Awdry decided that \"BoCo\" flowed better than \"CoBo\", and sounded more affectionate.\n\nIn the Railway Series, BoCo carries his North Western Railway number 'D2', whereas in the television series he carries the number D5702, which is in the range of numbers assigned to the real \"Metrovick\" locomotives by British Railways. In reality, D5702, built in October 1958, was withdrawn in September 1968 and cut up in November 1969.\nOne of BoCo's brothers, numbered D5701 was one of the diesels that was looking for Oliver back when Oliver was escaping from scrap. D5701 was withdrawn a few months after Oliver hid in an old quarry branch and scrapped the following year.\n\n====Bear/D7101====\n''Bear'' (real name ''Bristol Siddeley'') was originally known as ''D7101''.\n\nAs described in the books, D7101 first arrived on the Island of Sodor on a trial for The Fat Controller. He was accompanied by another diesel engine, [[The Other Railway#D199.2F.22Spamcan.22|D199]], who talked about taking over the railway, which D7101 didn't like. Later in the same story, D7101 suffered from a failed ejector and had to be rescued by Henry. He befriended his rescuer, and The Fat Controller decided to give him a second chance.  D7101 was given a new name, Bear, a new number, D3, and a new coat of paint, and D199 was sent away in disgrace.\n\nBear attracted his nickname because of the sound of his engine, which is loud and gives off a growling sound he can't help. Bear was one of the later additions to the ''Railway Series'' universe, built in 1964 and arriving in 1967. He is based on the [[British Rail Class 35]] \"Hymek\" [[AAR wheel arrangement#B-B|B-B]] [[diesel-hydraulic]] locomotive, first built in 1961.\n\nBear now pulls the Express. He wears the two-tone green livery he would have carried when built (all-over British Railways locomotive green, with a narrow band of a lighter, lime green along the bottom of the sides, cream-white cab window surrounds, and a small yellow warning panel). When he arrived he wore the [[British Rail]] '[[Rail Blue]]' livery.\n\nLike D199, The Bear's number, D7101, is fictional but plausible; the final Class 35 was numbered 'D7100'.\n\nHe first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Enterprising Engines|''Enterprising Engines'']] and he has several cameos, one very noticeable cameo is in the \"James And The Diesel Engine\" Story: \"Old Stuck-Up\" where he is shown with BoCo and the other engines in the shed.\n\n====Mavis====\n{{for2|the character in Thomas & Friends|[[Railway engines (Thomas and Friends)#Mavis|Mavis (TV series)]]}}\n''Mavis'' (real name ''Gardner'') is a [[0-6-0]] diesel-mechanical shunting engine. She belongs to the [[Ffarquhar]] Quarry Co. rather than the Fat Controller, and works mainly shunting stone trucks in their quarry. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} She sometimes brings Toby's trucks down the line when he is busy. She is painted black, with yellow-and-black \"hazard\" stripes on her radiator and cab back. Mavis is based on a BR [[British Rail Class 04|Class 04]], some of which were fitted with the sideplates and cow-catcher for use on the [[Wisbech and Upwell Tramway]], the same line that Toby came from. She was built by the Drewry Car Company <ref>{{cite web|title=The Wisbech and Upwell Tramway: Toby and Mavis|url=https://www.lner.info/co/GER/wisbech/toby_mavis.php|website=lner.info|publisher=LNER|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}</ref> and arrived on Sodor in 1962.\n\nWhen she was young, she was convinced that she knew it all and that Toby with his worn-in rules and methods was a \"fusspot\", but discovered that sometimes there is nothing wrong with taking advice - ignoring Toby's advice on truck-management-skills brought Mavis to a literal standstill at a level crossing near Ffarquhar where iced rails allowed the trucks to turn the tables on her. To Mavis' indignation rescue came in the form of 'fusspot' Toby. However  the two became friends when she rescued him from a collapsing bridge. She is now allowed to come down the line from time to time, and is a useful addition to the branch line.\n\nShe first appeared in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#Tramway Engines|''Tramway Engines'']]. She was named after the Rev W. Awdry's neighbour in Rodborough, Stroud.\n\n====Pip and Emma====\n'''Pip and Emma''' (real names '''Phillipa and Emily''') are the two class 43 locomotives (or \"power cars\") which top and tail an [[InterCity 125]] High-Speed diesel trainset in [[The Railway Series]]. They had experienced problems with their cooling system and came to the railway when Gordon was on a journey. They soon made friends with all the engines.\n\nThey have had three appearances, one in [[List of Railway Series Books#Gordon the High Speed Engine|''Gordon the High-Speed Engine'']], and two others as main characters in [[List of Railway Series Books#Thomas and the Fat Controller's Engines|''Thomas and the Fat Controller's Engines'']] and [[List of Railway Series Books#Thomas and his Friends|''Thomas and His Friends'']]. Following [[Privatisation of British Rail|Privatisation]], the Fat Controller has decided to purchase them in order to run a faster service to London.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Awdry\n  | first =Christopher\n  | authorlink =Christopher Awdry\n  | title =Sodor, Reading Between the Lines\n  | publisher =Sodor Enterprises\n  | year =2005\n  | isbn =0-9549665-1-1\n  | id =\n  | page =9  }}</ref>\n\nPip and Emma are based on the [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|British Rail Class 43 HST]] painted in the original InterCity 125 livery of yellow and blue, and built in 1975. After being purchased by the Fat Controller in 2011, the words \"InterCity 125\" and the BR Logo which were painted on their sides were replaced by \"NWR\" and have red nameplates with yellow writing.\n\nPip and Emma are also the names of two sibling characters in the [[Agatha Christie]] novel ''[[A Murder is Announced]]''. The phrase \"[[wikt:pip emma|pip emma]]\" was also used in the [[wikt:signalese|signalese]] developed by the [[British Army]] [[signaller]]s in the [[First World War]] to mean ''[[post meridiem]]'', or p.m.\n\n===Rolling stock===\n\n====Annie and Clarabel====\n{{Main|Annie and Clarabel}}\n\n''Annie and Clarabel'' are [[#Thomas|Thomas]]' coaches and carry passengers on his branch line. They are his ''[[confidant]]es'' and friends.\n\n====Henrietta====\n{{main|Toby the Tram Engine#Henrietta|l1=Henrietta}}\n''Henrietta'' is Toby's four-wheeled [[Great Eastern Railway|GER]] non-articulated coach.\n\n====Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel====\n\n''Isabel, Dulcie, Alice and Mirabel'' are Great Western autocoaches who work with Oliver (Isabel and Dulcie) and Duck (Alice and Mirabel) on the Little Western.\n\n==Skarloey Railway==\n{{Main|Skarloey Railway}}\n\nSkarloey Railway locomotives numbers 1 to 6 each have real-life equivalents, with the same numbers, on the [[Talyllyn Railway]].\n\n===Skarloey===\n\n{{Main|Skarloey}}\n'''Skarloey''' (No. 1) is one of the oldest engines on the Island of Sodor. He is a wise and kind engine who knows everything there is to know about running a railway. He has great respect for coaches, passengers and his fellow engines, and often gives advice to the younger engines when it is needed. He also acts as a narrator in several of the stories.\n\nWhen he first arrived in 1865, he was proud and arrogant, and believed himself too good to pull trucks. He also suffered from a short wheelbase which made him unstable and gave him the nickname \"Bucking [[Bronco]]\". He was given an extra set of wheels and a cab, which made him pompous still. However, he was eventually shown the error of his ways. From then on, Skarloey became a hard worker, running the line with Rheneas until he was worn out.\n\nHe first appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']]. The story of his early years was told in [[List of Railway Series Books#Very Old Engines|''Very Old Engines'']].\n\n===Rheneas===\n\n{{Main|Rheneas}}\n'''Rheneas''' (No. 2) is one of the oldest engines on the Island of Sodor. Rheneas is known as the \"Gallant Old Engine\" because he saved the railway by getting a train home after a breakdown.\n\nHe was built in 1865 by [[Fletcher, Jennings & Co.|Fletcher, Jennings]] of Whitehaven, the same company that built Skarloey. He arrived shortly after Skarloey, but was at the start the more sensible of the two engines. He was a determined engine, and by the early 1950s he was running the railway alone. In [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']], he was sent away to be overhauled and did not return until seven books later, in [[List of Railway Series Books#Gallant Old Engine|''Gallant Old Engine'']].\n\n===Sir Handel===\n\n{{Main|Sir Handel}}\n'''Sir Handel''' (No. 3) is named after the owner of the Skarloey Railway, Sir Handel Brown. He worked on the [[Mid Sodor Railway]] under the name [[Mid Sodor Railway#Falcon|Falcon]]. He is a stubborn and pompous engine who thinks that pulling trucks is beneath him, and will do anything to get out of jobs he does not want to do.\n\nHe was built in 1904 at the [[Falcon Works]] in [[Loughborough]], and arrived on the Mid Sodor Railway in the same year, when he was painted blue and carried the name 'Falcon'. After that line closed, he was sold to the Sodor Aluminium Company and then to the [[Skarloey Railway]], which at the time was desperately short of locomotives. Sir Handel did not cope well with the neglected track on his new railway, and would often derail - sometimes deliberately. He was given special wheels with broad tyres to cure this problem, which were soon known as \"steamroller wheels\" by the other engines.\n\nIn the 1980s, he was invited to the [[Talyllyn Railway]]. This story actually had some basis in fact, as the Talyllyn Railway had paid tribute to the Railway Series by repainting their locomotive ''Sir Haydn'' to resemble Sir Handel. Sir Handel was actually based upon ''Sir Haydn''.\n\nIn the recent TV series, Sir Handel has a kind and wise personality like Skarloey, Rheneas, and Duke.\n\nSir Handel first appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']].\n\n===Peter Sam===\n\n{{Main|Peter Sam}}\n'''Peter Sam''' (No. 4) was known as [[Mid Sodor Railway#Stuart|Stuart]] when he worked on the [[Mid Sodor Railway]]. He is a polite engine, popular with passengers and coaches alike. Even the trucks do not play tricks on him.\n\nHe was built in 1920 for the Mid Sodor Railway by [[Kerr Stuart]] of Stoke-on-Trent, and was therefore given the name 'Stuart'. Like Sir Handel, he was later sold to the Sodor Aluminium Company and then to the Skarloey Railway. Following an accident with some slate trucks (set before the arrival of Duncan), he soon lost his funnel and was fitted with a [[Giesl ejector]] which made steaming far easier (set before Sir Handel got new wheels).\n\nIn the 1990s he was sent to the Talyllyn Railway. As with Sir Handel, this was based upon the Talyllyn Railway creating a \"lookalike\" engine, in this case by repainting the locomotive ''Edward Thomas''.\n\nHe first appeared in [[List of Railway Series Books#Four Little Engines|''Four Little Engines'']].\n\n===Rusty===\n\n{{Main|Rusty the Diesel}}\n'''Rusty''' (No. 5) is a black [[diesel-mechanical]] locomotive built by the [[Ruston & Hornsby]] company from which he gets his name. He was acquired direct from the manufacturers in 1957.<ref name=SRBtL_SkarloeyRly>{{cite book\n | last  = Awdry\n | first = Christopher\n | authorlink = Christopher Awdry\n | title =[[List of Railway Series Books#Sodor: Reading Between the Lines|''Sodor: Reading Between the Lines'']]\n | publisher =Sodor Enterprises\n | year  = 2005\n | page = 13\n | isbn  = 0-9549665-1-1\n }}</ref> His equivalent engine on the Talyllyn Railway is ''Midlander''.\n\nHe is a reliable, practical and friendly little engine who mainly works on maintenance duties, although he can also pull passenger or goods trains if the need arises.\n\nHe arrived in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#The Little Old Engine|''The Little Old Engine'']].\n\n===Duncan===\n\n{{Main|Duncan (fictional locomotive)}}\n'''Duncan''' (No .6) is a well tank locomotive, built by [[Andrew Barclay Sons & Co.|Andrew Barclay]] of Kilmarnock in 1918, and arrived on Sodor in 1958.<ref name=SRBtL_SkarloeyRly/> He arrived on the railway [[second-hand]], as a replacement when Peter Sam had his accident at the quarry. He was rough and bad-mannered, and believed himself to be overworked. He would often sway and lurch along the track \u2013 what the Thin Controller referred to as \"[[rock 'n' roll]]\". He had a number of accidents as a result. Although he can still get grumpy, cheeky, and cynical, his behavior has greatly improved and he became a much nicer, respectable, more useful locomotive. His exact origins are unknown, but he did once work in a factory, according to Peter Sam.\n\nHe arrived in the book [[List of Railway Series Books#The Little Old Engine|''The Little Old Engine'']].\n\n==Non-Rail Characters==\n\n===Terence===\n\n{{Main|Terence the Tractor}}\n\n''Terence'' is a tractor who was first seen in 'Thomas, Terence and the Snow' in the book ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Tank Engine Thomas Again|Tank Engine Thomas Again]]'' (1949). He can go \"anywhere\" thanks to his caterpillar tracks and once famously helped Thomas out of a snowdrift. He was built in 1934.\n\n===Bertie===\n\n{{Main|Bertie the Bus}}\n''Bertie'' is the friendly bus that first appears in the story in which he rescues [[#Thomas|Thomas]]' passengers whilst in a snow drift, and has his most famous adventure when he challenges Thomas to a race.\n\n===Trevor the Traction Engine===\n\n{{Main|Trevor the Traction Engine}}\n\n''Trevor'' is a traction engine who was rescued in the story [[List of Railway Series Books#Edward the Blue Engine|'Saved from Scrap']] and spends most of his time working in the orchard alongside Edward's branch line. He is used for all sorts of odd jobs.\n\n===Harold===\n\n{{Main|Harold the Helicopter}}\n\n''Harold'' is a friendly helicopter to The Railway Series characters, although they share a friendly rivalry. He is owned by the Island's coastguard and lives at [[Fictional Locations (The Railway Series)#Dryaw|Dryaw Airfield]]. He was built in 1949 and appears in 1956.\n\n=='Human' Characters==\n\n===The Fat Controller===\n\n{{Main|The Fat Controller}}\n''Sir Topham Hatt'', The Fat Controller, is the head of the main rail company on [[Sodor (fictional island)|Sodor]]. He is a firm but fair leader for whom the engines have the greatest respect.\n\n==Minor characters==\nThe minor characters are described in the articles about the railways on which they operate:\n*[[Skarloey Railway]] characters\n*[[Culdee Fell Railway#Locomotives|Culdee Fell Railway locomotives]]\n*[[Arlesdale Railway#Locomotives|Arlesdale Railway locomotives]]\n*[[Mid Sodor Railway#Locomotives|Mid Sodor Railway locomotives]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Thomas}}\n\n[[Category:The Railway Series characters| Major]]\n[[Category:Fictional locomotives|Railway Series]]\n", "name_user": "Ravenclaw53", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBertie)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_The_Railway_Series"}
