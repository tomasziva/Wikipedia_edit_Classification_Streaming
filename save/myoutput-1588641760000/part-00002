The information that is usually obtained is the patient's full name, date of birth, address, email, phone number, marital status, gender, social security number, emergency contact, release of information, primary insurance provider information. Clerical errors that are made within patient registration processes are one of the biggest culprits that cause non-clinical denials from insurance payers.  This can include many errors such as inputting an incorrect date of birth, not validating current insurance coverage/benefits, misspelling a guarantor's name, etc.  Normally, these errors are usually easy to identify and amend upon submitting a new bill to most payers after correcting a mistake made in the registration department.  It is critically important to monitor denials on a daily basis in order to identify how much denial ratio is generated from these clerical errors so that both training and education can take place with the appropriate staff within the registration department.\n\n==Medical coding==\nAn important aspect of the revenue cycle is compliance with [[Medical classification|medical coding]] regulations. Optimal coding compliance results in higher revenues and decreases claim denials from insurance companies. By achieving optimal coding, a medical practice can prevent disruption of the medical flow and avoid regulatory penalties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.genpact.com/docs/resource-/regulatory-impact-on-revenue-cycle-management|title=Regulatory Impact on Revenue Cycle Management\u2014 Think You\u2019re Prepared?

Usually, a third-party claim scrubbing system is then used to ensure that claims are clean and complete as possible, including edits that may automatically update the raw claim data received from the host system. The intention of this scrubbing is to inevitably avoid generating a potential denial from the payer, which can prolong reimbursement to a provider. The claim is then sent out from the provider to the payer in an ANSI 837 5010 standard format.\n\nDenials can be sent back as a response to the claim from the payer stating a specific reason of why the claim cannot be adjudicated.  This is where denial management processes help to ensure that there is an immediate resolution to these denials.  Denial management can also help to identify if there are trending issues within a provider's workflow processes, whether it be clinical or clerical-related.  Feedback should be provided to the responsible revenue cycle departments if any of them were the cause of the denial, especially with denial types such as medical necessity, registration/clerical entry errors, etc. In the current market scenario, there is a growing demand for revenue cycle management solutions.
