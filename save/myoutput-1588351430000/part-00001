The population was 16,325 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the largest city in Campbell County and it is officially part of the [[Cincinnati \u2013 Northern Kentucky metropolitan area]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:George Henry Thomas - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Henry Thomas|George Thomas]], for whom the city was named.]]\nEvidence suggests that on or around 1749, prior to settlement by Europeans, a large battle occurred between a band of [[Cherokee]] Native Americans and victorious [[Miami tribe]] and [[Shawnee]] tribe Native Americans in what is now the city of Fort Thomas. As many as 600 graves of slain warriors have been unearthed by archeologists there; although the battleground area has been thoroughly combed for artifacts and remains over the years, it is still not uncommon to find arrowheads and other artifacts from the past while gardening or hiking the woods and streambeds throughout the city. \nIn 1887, a site was needed to house a [[United States Army]] post to replace [[Newport Barracks]] located in the adjoining city of [[Newport, Kentucky]]. Built in 1803, Newport Barracks replaced the smaller [[Fort Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio|Fort Washington]], located across the [[Ohio River]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. That army post was located at the junction of the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking]] and Ohio Rivers, but it was prone to flooding and flooded numerous times during the early 1880s.  A new, less flood prone location was sought.\n\nGeneral [[Philip Sheridan]] personally selected {{convert|11|acre|ha}} of the city and dubbed the area the Highlands, predicting it to become the \"[[United States Military Academy|West Point]] of the West.\" The new post was named Fort Thomas in honor of General [[George Henry Thomas]].\n\nThe area has many remnants of this era with a {{convert|102|ft|m|adj=on}} high Stone Water Tower as a familiar landmark which stands at the entrance to Tower Park. It was the 16th structure built on the grounds of the Military Reservation. It encloses a standpipe which has a capacity of 100,000 gallons, pumped from the Water District reservoirs just across South Fort Thomas Avenue. In 1890 when the military base was established, such provisions for water supply was necessary as there was no other water tower in this area. Cannons that were captured in [[Cuba]]'s Havana Harbor during the Spanish\u2013American War rest on stone platforms in front of the Tower. The dates marked on these [[cannon]]s, reflecting the date they were made in [[Barcelona]], Spain, are \"1768\" and \"1769.\"\n\nThe U.S. [[6th Infantry Regiment]] moved to Fort Thomas, where it remained until called to action again in June 1898, in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\n[[Samuel Woodfill]] was transferred to the Fort Thomas Army post in 1912. He married Lorena Wiltshire on Christmas Day in 1917 and they purchased a house near the fort. In [[World War I]] he was courageous, leading his men against the Germans. His bravery earned him many medals and awards and he was described as the most decorated soldier of the war. In civilian life, however, he struggled to pay his bills. He was unsuccessful at creating an orchard, and worked as a carpenter, a watchman and a guard. His wife died in March 1942, but two months later, the Army commissioned Woodfill and another [[World War I]] hero, [[Alvin C. York]] as Majors to build morale and promote enlistments. Woodfill retired again in 1944, but memories of his wife in Fort Thomas caused him to return to [[Indiana]], where he was born.\n\nOn February 25, 1937, [[Paul Tibbets]] enlisted here as a flying cadet in the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. During the last days of [[World War II]], Paul became known as the pilot that dropped the first [[atomic bomb]] on August 6, 1945.\n\nFort Thomas served as a depot, induction center, and military hospital.  Most of the garrison was transferred to the Veterans Administration in 1946, but military activities continued until the fort was closed in 1964.\n\n==Geography==\nFort Thomas is located at {{Coord|39|4|34|N|84|27|5|W|type:city}} (39.076011, \u221284.451273).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=23 April 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|5.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.8|sqmi|km2}} of it (11.82%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\nFort Thomas is located within a climatic transition zone at the extreme northern limit of the [[humid subtropical climate]]. The local climate is a basically a blend of the subtropics to the south and the [[humid continental climate]] to the north. There are several \"micro-climates\" found in Fort Thomas which produce warmer than usual or cooler than usual \"pockets\". In the warmer niches it is not at all uncommon to find such \"subtropical\" novelties as the [[common wall lizard]], the Southern magnolia ''([[Magnolia grandiflora]])'', and even the rare [[Needle palm]]; [[Blue spruce]] and [[Salamander]] tend to occur in the cooler and shaded niches. Moderating variables for the overall climate of Fort Thomas include: the Ohio River, the region's relatively large hills and valleys, and an urban heat influence due to the proximity of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky (Covington, Newport, etc.) metropolitan area. Fort Thomas is located within the [[Bluegrass region]] of Kentucky and Southern Ohio and is also situated within the northern periphery of the [[Upland South]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n| 1920= 5028\n| 1930= 10008\n| 1940= 11034\n| 1950= 10870\n| 1960= 14896\n| 1970= 16338\n| 1980= 16012\n| 1990= 16032\n| 2000= 16495\n| 2010= 16325\n| estyear=2018\n| estimate=16364\n| estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| footnote = U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url= https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title= Census of Population and Housing |publisher= Census.gov |accessdate= June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=31 January 2008 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2010, there were 16,325 people, 6,787 households, and 4,219 families residing in the city.

Johnson Elementary, Ruth Moyer Elementary, and Samuel Woodfill Elementary), Highlands Middle School, and Highlands High School, which are consistently ranked among the top in the country. [[Highlands High School (Kentucky)|Highlands High School]] is the only public high school in the state with a [[Cum Laude Society]] chapter.<ref>[http://cumlaudesociety.org/members.html Cum Laude Membership<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007082546/http://cumlaudesociety.org/members.html |date=October 7, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n[[Highlands High School (Kentucky)|Highlands High School]] is ranked in the top 550 in the United States by ''[[US News & World Report]]''.\n\nThe mascot for Highlands is the bluebird. According to local legend, in the early twentieth century the original mascot for the school was the Highlands Blue [[Devil]]. A local clergyman objected to the association of the community to the devil. At the time, the boys' track team had an exceptionally good year and it was remarked that they \"flew like birds.\" This gave rise to the new and current mascot.\n\nThe Highlands football program is one of the most storied in all of Kentucky. Highlands has won 20 official state football championships and three \"mythical\" state titles prior to Kentucky instituting a statewide playoff system. The Bluebirds currently rank second in the state and fifth in the entire nation in total number of wins. Current NFL free agent [[Jared Lorenzen]] starred in football at Highlands. He signed as a free-agent with the Giants after attending the [[University of Kentucky]]. [[Mike Mitchell (safety)|Michael Mitchell]], who was drafted in 2009 by the Oakland Raiders with the 47th pick, played football at Highlands. [[Ben Guidugli]], who was also a member of Highlands Football, played TE at the University of Cincinnati and was picked up as free agent by the St. Louis Rams in 2011.\n\nThe school has won girls' cross country championships in 1978\u20131980, 2002\u20132004 and 2012\u20132015 and has won back to back girls' soccer championships (2005\u20132006). The boys and girls soccer teams were State Runner-up in 2008, the first time in state history both teams made the finals from one school. The girls' track team won consecutive state championships in 2008 and 2009 (we will continue winning hahaha).\n\nThe Highlands [[marching band|band]], has also received recognition. The marching band placed sixth in the [[Kentucky Music Educators Association|KMEA]] State semi-finals competition in November 2005. They also achieved 5th place in November 2009, only missing Finals by a quarter of a point. In May 2007, the concert band received a distinguished rating, the highest, in the Kentucky State Concert Band Festival at the [[University of Louisville]].\n\nThe Highlands Girls [[Tennis]] Team has also won regionals and qualified for the state tournament four years running.\n\nThere are two [[Catholic]] private schools in the city, Saint Thomas Elementary and Saint Catherine Elementary.\n\nFort Thomas has a [[public library]], a branch of the Campbell County Public Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111202017/https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | url-status=dead | archive-date=11 January 2019 | title=Kentucky Public Library Directory | publisher=Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives | accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nFort Thomas is situated on the southern border of the Ohio River, directly opposite of [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.

The population was 16,325 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the largest city in Campbell County and it is officially part of the [[Cincinnati \u2013 Northern Kentucky metropolitan area]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:George Henry Thomas - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Henry Thomas|George Thomas]], for whom the city was named.]]\nEvidence suggests that on or around 1749, prior to settlement by Europeans, a large battle occurred between a band of [[Cherokee]] Native Americans and victorious [[Miami tribe]] and [[Shawnee]] tribe Native Americans in what is now the city of Fort Thomas. As many as 600 graves of slain warriors have been unearthed by archeologists there; although the battleground area has been thoroughly combed for artifacts and remains over the years, it is still not uncommon to find arrowheads and other artifacts from the past while gardening or hiking the woods and streambeds throughout the city. \nIn 1887, a site was needed to house a [[United States Army]] post to replace [[Newport Barracks]] located in the adjoining city of [[Newport, Kentucky]]. Built in 1803, Newport Barracks replaced the smaller [[Fort Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio|Fort Washington]], located across the [[Ohio River]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. That army post was located at the junction of the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking]] and Ohio Rivers, but it was prone to flooding and flooded numerous times during the early 1880s.  A new, less flood prone location was sought.\n\nGeneral [[Philip Sheridan]] personally selected {{convert|11|acre|ha}} of the city and dubbed the area the Highlands, predicting it to become the \"[[United States Military Academy|West Point]] of the West.\" The new post was named Fort Thomas in honor of General [[George Henry Thomas]].\n\nThe area has many remnants of this era with a {{convert|102|ft|m|adj=on}} high Stone Water Tower as a familiar landmark which stands at the entrance to Tower Park. It was the 16th structure built on the grounds of the Military Reservation. It encloses a standpipe which has a capacity of 100,000 gallons, pumped from the Water District reservoirs just across South Fort Thomas Avenue. In 1890 when the military base was established, such provisions for water supply was necessary as there was no other water tower in this area. Cannons that were captured in [[Cuba]]'s Havana Harbor during the Spanish\u2013American War rest on stone platforms in front of the Tower. The dates marked on these [[cannon]]s, reflecting the date they were made in [[Barcelona]], Spain, are \"1768\" and \"1769.\"\n\nThe U.S. [[6th Infantry Regiment]] moved to Fort Thomas, where it remained until called to action again in June 1898, in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\n[[Samuel Woodfill]] was transferred to the Fort Thomas Army post in 1912. He married Lorena Wiltshire on Christmas Day in 1917 and they purchased a house near the fort. In [[World War I]] he was courageous, leading his men against the Germans. His bravery earned him many medals and awards and he was described as the most decorated soldier of the war. In civilian life, however, he struggled to pay his bills. He was unsuccessful at creating an orchard, and worked as a carpenter, a watchman and a guard. His wife died in March 1942, but two months later, the Army commissioned Woodfill and another [[World War I]] hero, [[Alvin C. York]] as Majors to build morale and promote enlistments. Woodfill retired again in 1944, but memories of his wife in Fort Thomas caused him to return to [[Indiana]], where he was born.\n\nOn February 25, 1937, [[Paul Tibbets]] enlisted here as a flying cadet in the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. During the last days of [[World War II]], Paul became known as the pilot that dropped the first [[atomic bomb]] on August 6, 1945.\n\nFort Thomas served as a depot, induction center, and military hospital.  Most of the garrison was transferred to the Veterans Administration in 1946, but military activities continued until the fort was closed in 1964.\n\n==Geography==\nFort Thomas is located at {{Coord|39|4|34|N|84|27|5|W|type:city}} (39.076011, \u221284.451273).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=23 April 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|5.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.8|sqmi|km2}} of it (11.82%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\nFort Thomas is located within a climatic transition zone at the extreme northern limit of the [[humid subtropical climate]]. The local climate is a basically a blend of the subtropics to the south and the [[humid continental climate]] to the north. There are several \"micro-climates\" found in Fort Thomas which produce warmer than usual or cooler than usual \"pockets\". In the warmer niches it is not at all uncommon to find such \"subtropical\" novelties as the [[common wall lizard]], the Southern magnolia ''([[Magnolia grandiflora]])'', and even the rare [[Needle palm]]; [[Blue spruce]] and [[Salamander]] tend to occur in the cooler and shaded niches. Moderating variables for the overall climate of Fort Thomas include: the Ohio River, the region's relatively large hills and valleys, and an urban heat influence due to the proximity of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky (Covington, Newport, etc.) metropolitan area. Fort Thomas is located within the [[Bluegrass region]] of Kentucky and Southern Ohio and is also situated within the northern periphery of the [[Upland South]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n| 1920= 5028\n| 1930= 10008\n| 1940= 11034\n| 1950= 10870\n| 1960= 14896\n| 1970= 16338\n| 1980= 16012\n| 1990= 16032\n| 2000= 16495\n| 2010= 16325\n| estyear=2018\n| estimate=16364\n| estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| footnote = U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url= https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title= Census of Population and Housing |publisher= Census.gov |accessdate= June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=31 January 2008 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2010, there were 16,325 people, 6,787 households, and 4,219 families residing in the city.

Johnson Elementary, Ruth Moyer Elementary, and Samuel Woodfill Elementary), Highlands Middle School, and Highlands High School, which are consistently ranked among the top in the country. [[Highlands High School (Kentucky)|Highlands High School]] is the only public high school in the state with a [[Cum Laude Society]] chapter.<ref>[http://cumlaudesociety.org/members.html Cum Laude Membership<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007082546/http://cumlaudesociety.org/members.html |date=October 7, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n[[Highlands High School (Kentucky)|Highlands High School]] is ranked in the top 550 in the United States by ''[[US News & World Report]]''.\n\nThe mascot for Highlands is the bluebird. According to local legend, in the early twentieth century the original mascot for the school was the Highlands Blue [[Devil]]. A local clergyman objected to the association of the community to the devil. At the time, the boys' track team had an exceptionally good year and it was remarked that they \"flew like birds.\" This gave rise to the new and current mascot.\n\nThe Highlands football program is one of the most storied in all of Kentucky. Highlands has won 20 official state football championships and three \"mythical\" state titles prior to Kentucky instituting a statewide playoff system. The Bluebirds currently rank second in the state and fifth in the entire nation in total number of wins. Current NFL free agent [[Jared Lorenzen]] starred in football at Highlands. He signed as a free-agent with the Giants after attending the [[University of Kentucky]]. [[Mike Mitchell (safety)|Michael Mitchell]], who was drafted in 2009 by the Oakland Raiders with the 47th pick, played football at Highlands. [[Ben Guidugli]], who was also a member of Highlands Football, played TE at the University of Cincinnati and was picked up as free agent by the St. Louis Rams in 2011.\n\nThe school has won girls' cross country championships in 1978\u20131980, 2002\u20132004 and 2012\u20132015 and has won back to back girls' soccer championships (2005\u20132006). The boys and girls soccer teams were State Runner-up in 2008, the first time in state history both teams made the finals from one school. The girls' track team won consecutive state championships in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe Highlands [[marching band|band]], has also received recognition. The marching band placed sixth in the [[Kentucky Music Educators Association|KMEA]] State semi-finals competition in November 2005. They also achieved 5th place in November 2009, only missing Finals by a quarter of a point. In May 2007, the concert band received a distinguished rating, the highest, in the Kentucky State Concert Band Festival at the [[University of Louisville]].\n\nThe Highlands Girls [[Tennis]] Team has also won regionals and qualified for the state tournament four years running.\n\nThere are two [[Catholic]] private schools in the city, Saint Thomas Elementary and Saint Catherine Elementary.\n\nFort Thomas has a [[public library]], a branch of the Campbell County Public Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111202017/https://kdla.ky.gov/librarians/pages/librarydirectory.aspx | url-status=dead | archive-date=11 January 2019 | title=Kentucky Public Library Directory | publisher=Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives | accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nFort Thomas is situated on the southern border of the Ohio River, directly opposite of [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.
