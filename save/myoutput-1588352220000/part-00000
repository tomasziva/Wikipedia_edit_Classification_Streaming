It encompasses the [[health care]] dimensions of [[family planning]], [[Pre-conception counseling|preconception]], [[Prenatal care|prenatal]], and [[postnatal]] care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience, in most cases, and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, in other cases.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO Maternal Health}}</ref>\n\n== Maternal morbidity and mortality ==\n[[The United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) estimated that 289,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2013.<ref name=\"unfpa.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}</ref> These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour, all of which have highly effective interventions. As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013.<ref name=\"unfpa.org\"/> This has resulted in many countries halving their maternal death rates.\n\nWhile there has been a decline in worldwide mortality rates much more has to be done. High rates still exist particularly in impoverished communities with over 85% living in Africa and Southern Asia.<ref name=\"unfpa.org\"/> The effect of a mother's death results in vulnerable families, and their [[infant]]s, if they survive childbirth, are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday.\n\nBoth maternal mortality (death) and severe maternal morbidity (illness) are \"associated with a high rate of preventability.\"<ref name=\"ACOG_SMFM_2016\"/>\n\nIn 2010 the U.S. [[Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations]] described [[maternal mortality]] as a \"[[sentinel event]]\", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system.{{sfn|Joint Commission|2010}}\n\nFour elements are essential to maternal death prevention. First, prenatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and foetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are haemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker is assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/your-postpartum-checkups.aspx|title=Your postpartum checkups|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Factors influencing maternal health==\n[[File:MDG5.svg|thumb|Logo of [[Millennium Development Goal]] 5|alt=Logo depicting pregnant woman, used in Millennium Development Goal 5, maternal health]]\n\n=== Poverty and access to healthcare ===\nAccording to a [[UNFPA]] report, social and economic status, culture norms and values, and geographic remoteness all increase a maternal mortality, and the risk for maternal death (during pregnancy or childbirth) in sub-Saharan Africa is 175 times higher than in developed countries, and risk for pregnancy-related illnesses and negative consequences after birth is even higher.<ref name=\"Determinants\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/EN-SRH%20fact%20sheet-Poormother.pdf|title=The social determinants of maternal death and disability|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund]]}}</ref> [[Poverty]], maternal health, and outcomes for the child are all interconnected.<ref name=\"Filippi\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Filippi V, Ronsmans C, Campbell OM, Graham WJ, Mills A, Borghi J, Koblinsky M, Osrin D | title = Maternal health in poor countries: the broader context and a call for action | journal = Lancet | volume = 368 | issue = 9546 | pages = 1535\u201341 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17071287 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69384-7 }}</ref>\n\nWomen living in poverty-stricken areas are more likely to be [[Obesity|obese]] and engage in unhealthy behaviors such as cigarette smoking and [[Substance abuse|drug use]], are less likely to engage in or even have access to legitimate prenatal care, and are at a significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child.<ref name=Timmermans>{{cite journal | vauthors = Timmermans S, Bonsel GJ, Steegers-Theunissen RP, Mackenbach JP, Steyerberg EW, Raat H, Verbrugh HA, Tiemeier HW, Hofman A, Birnie E, Looman CW, Jaddoe VW, Steegers EA | title = Individual accumulation of heterogeneous risks explains perinatal inequalities within deprived neighbourhoods | journal = European Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u201380 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21203801 | pmc = 3043261 | doi = 10.1007/s10654-010-9542-5 }}</ref> A study conducted in Kenya observed that common maternal health problems in poverty-stricken areas include hemorrhaging, [[Anemia in pregnancy|anemia]], [[hypertension]], malaria, placenta retention, [[premature labor]], prolonged/complicated labor, and [[pre-eclampsia]].<ref name=Izugbara>{{cite journal | vauthors = Izugbara CO, Ngilangwa DP | title = Women, poverty and adverse maternal outcomes in Nairobi, Kenya | journal = BMC Women's Health | volume = 10 | issue = 33 | pages = 33 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21122118 | pmc = 3014866 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6874-10-33 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, adequate [[prenatal care]] encompasses medical care and educational, social, and nutritional services during pregnancy.<ref name=Alexander>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander G, Korenbrot CC |title=The Role of Prenatal Care in Preventing Low Birth Weight|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 1995|volume=5|series=Low Birth Weight|issue=1|pages=103\u2013120|jstor=1602510|doi=10.2307/1602510}}</ref> Although there are a variety of reasons women choose not to engage in proper prenatal care, 71% of low-income women in a US national study had difficulties getting access to prenatal care when they sought it out.<ref name=Alexander /> Additionally, immigrants and Hispanic women are at higher risk than white or black women for receiving little to no prenatal care, where level of education is also an indicator (since education and race are correlated).

The ''Surgeon General's Report'' lists various systemic diseases and conditions that have oral manifestations.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" /> The oral cavity serves as both a site of and a gateway entry of disease for microbial infections, which can affect general health status. In addition, some studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the report establishes a relationship between oral health and quality of life, including functional, psychosocial, and economic indicators. Poor oral health can affect diet, nutrition, sleep, psychological status, social interaction, school, and work.\n\nProtection and control of oral health and diseases safeguards a woman's health and quality of life before and during pregnancy.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\">{{cite web|author=Oral Health Care During Pregnancy Expert Workgroup |year=2012|title=Oral health care during pregnancy: a national consensus statement\u2014summary of an expert workgroup meeting|location=Washington, DC|publisher=National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center|url=http://www.mchoralhealth.org/PDFs/Oralhealthpregnancyconsensusmeetingsummary.pdf}}</ref> Also, it has the potential to decrease the transmission of pathogenic bacteria that occurs from mother to child.<ref name=\"Dental\" /> Along with pregnancy, come physiological changes for a woman. The changes, including fluctuating hormones, increase the woman's susceptibility to oral infections such as periodontal disease.

For example, one such study found that moderate or severe periodontal disease early in pregnancy was associated with delivery of small-for-gestational-age infant.<ref name=\"Boggessb\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boggess KA, Beck JD, Murtha AP, Moss K, Offenbacher S | title = Maternal periodontal disease in early pregnancy and risk for a small-for-gestational-age infant | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 194 | issue = 5 | pages = 1316\u201322 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16647916 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.11.059 }}</ref> Other studies have also found an association between periodontal disease and development of pre-eclampsia and pre-term births.<ref name=\"Boggessa\" />\n\nAnother notable oral disease pertinent to maternal child health is dental caries. Dental caries is the process of tooth decay, and the development of what is commonly known as cavities.<ref name=\"Boggessa\" /> Dental caries are transmitted from mother to child vertically; colonization of cariogenic bacteria primarily occurs from mother to child through saliva-sharing activities. Maternal oral flora can ultimately foretell oral flora in offspring.<ref name=\"Boggessc\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boggess KA | title = Maternal oral health in pregnancy | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 111 | issue = 4 | pages = 976\u201386 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18378759 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e31816a49d3 }}</ref> In addition, other maternal factors such as social, behavioral, and biological factors can predispose a child's experience with tooth-decay.<ref name=\"Boggessa\" /> Some of these factors include the lack of knowledge a mother possesses concerning oral health, which can influence the development of caries among her children. Compared to children whose mothers have good oral health, children whose mothers have bad oral health are five times as likely to have poor oral health.<ref name=\"National\" /> Poor maintenance of oral health has profound implications on the development of children. As mentioned in the Surgeon's General Report, oral health affects the quality of life, especially children, with respect to functional, psychological, economic, and overall emotional well-being of an individual.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" /> To demonstrate the adverse effects of poor oral health, take for example the consequences a simple cavity can have on a child. First, it is painful. This might cause a child to miss school or have poor concentration, eventually compromising school performance. In addition, due to the pain, it might result in poor weight gain or growth. Also, children may exhibit reduced self-esteem because of cosmetic issues. Furthermore, it can affect language and impair speech. Impaired speech development can also result in low self-esteem. Finally, cavities although easily preventable, can pose a financial burden of a family. Public dental services are scarce and costly to individuals who lack dental insurance. It may also result in unwarranted visits to emergency department. Poor oral health permeates into other aspects of life, posing threats to overall well-being, if not handled timely and effectively\n\nThe significance of oral health is apparent, however, many women do not receive dental services before, during, and after pregnancy, even with obvious signs of oral disease.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\" /> There are several factors at play regarding pregnant women not seeking dental care, including the role of the health care system and disposition of the woman herself. There is a common misconception that it is not safe to obtain dental services while pregnant. Many prenatal and oral health providers have limited knowledge about the impact and safety of delivering dental services; hence they might delay or withhold treatment during pregnancy.<ref name=\"Dental\" /> Moreover, some prenatal providers are not aware of the importance of oral health on overall general health, thus failing to refer their patients to dental providers.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\" /> First and foremost, the misconception regarding the impact of dental services while a woman is pregnant needs to be purged. There is a consensus that prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral diseases are highly beneficial and can be performed on pregnant women having no added fetal or maternal risk when compared to the risk of providing no oral care.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\" />  Equally important is establishing collaboration among clinicians, especially maternal health providers, with other dental providers. There should be coordination among general health and oral health providers, especially because of the interdependence of the two fields.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" />  Thus, it is imperative to educate and train health providers of the significance of oral health, designing methods to incorporate in their respective practices. Providers most provide education to pregnant women addressing the importance of oral health, because these women ultimately control the fate of themselves and their offspring. For example, providers can illustrate to mothers how to reduce cavities by wiping down the gums of their children with a soft cloth after breastfeeding or bottle-feeding.<ref name=\"Dental\" /> Bestowing knowledge and practical applications of good oral health maintenance measures to mothers can help improve overall health of the mother and child.  \nThere are still other factors in play when analyzing the low use of dental services by pregnant women, particularly prevalent among ethnic and racial minorities. A major factor is the lack of insurance and or access to dental services.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" /> For this reason, more data needs to be collected and analyzed so that programs are set up to effectively to reach all segments of the population.\n\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\nThe pregnancy related mortality ratio (PRMR) represents the number of deaths per 100,000 live births resulting from pregnancy or pregnancy related causes. Analysis of the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), indicates significant racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy related deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System {{!}} Maternal and Infant Health {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm|date=2020-02-04|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Specifically, A 2019 report from the CDC shows that the PRMRs of Black women and American Indian women in the United States are 3-4 times higher than that of White women. For White women during 2019, there were an approximate 13 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. For Black and American Indian women, there were 41 and 30 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births respectively. The majority of these deaths were due to preventable diseases associated with pregnancy related mortality, such as hypertension. While the fatality rate of these diseases was higher among Black and American Indian women, the initial prevalence was generally the same across all races.<ref name=\":022\">{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Emily E.|date=2019|title=Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Pregnancy-Related Deaths \u2014 United States, 2007\u20132016|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6835a3.htm|journal=MMWR.

They say that most pregnancy related deaths are the combined result of 3-4 contributing factors. For Black and American Indian women, this can include issues of implicit racial bias held by healthcare providers, which affects the quality of care given to treat or prevent a fatal disease. These factors can also be more structural (e.g. the gap in access to primary and preventative care in minority communities). In the CDC report, economic status is not cited as a leading cause of maternal mortality. While economic status and education level is a possible contributing factors to maternal mortality, the racial gap is shown to persist across all economic and education levels.<ref name=\":022\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\nThere are many factors that influence maternal health and the utilization of resources that women have access to. One of these factors that recent studies have highlighted is religion. A study that took place in St John\u2019s, Canada researched how immigrant Muslims living in the area were treated and given maternal care.<ref name=\":2\">Reitmanova, Sylvia; Gustafson, Diana L.

In order to provide a safer and more comfortable environment for Muslim women, it was proven that they needed more support that would connect with the immigrant community and health-related information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Discrimination based on religion is definitely a factor that effects the maternal health and health care of women from different backgrounds. It is evident that there needs to be proactive steps to adjust some of the mainstream practices to improve all maternal health. There is not a lot of discussion regarding the studies that reflect the hardships that women go through based on maternal care in terms of religion. Instead, there is a lot of stigma and norms regarding all religion that in turn place women at risk when receiving health-care.<ref>M\u00e5lqvist, Mats (2015-12-24). \"Preserving misconceptions or a call for action? \u2013 A hermeneutic re-reading of the Nativity story\".

The ''Surgeon General's Report'' lists various systemic diseases and conditions that have oral manifestations.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" /> The oral cavity serves as both a site of and a gateway entry of disease for microbial infections, which can affect general health status. In addition, some studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the report establishes a relationship between oral health and quality of life, including functional, psychosocial, and economic indicators. Poor oral health can affect diet, nutrition, sleep, psychological status, social interaction, school, and work.\n\nProtection and control of oral health and diseases safeguards a woman's health and quality of life before and during pregnancy.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\">{{cite web|author=Oral Health Care During Pregnancy Expert Workgroup |year=2012|title=Oral health care during pregnancy: a national consensus statement\u2014summary of an expert workgroup meeting|location=Washington, DC|publisher=National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center|url=http://www.mchoralhealth.org/PDFs/Oralhealthpregnancyconsensusmeetingsummary.pdf}}</ref> Also, it has the potential to decrease the transmission of pathogenic bacteria that occurs from mother to child.<ref name=\"Dental\" /> Along with pregnancy, come physiological changes for a woman. The changes, including fluctuating hormones, increase the woman's susceptibility to oral infections such as periodontal disease.

Dental caries is the process of tooth decay, and the development of what is commonly known as cavities.<ref name=\"Boggessa\" /> Dental caries are transmitted from mother to child vertically; colonization of cariogenic bacteria primarily occurs from mother to child through saliva-sharing activities. Maternal oral flora can ultimately foretell oral flora in offspring.<ref name=\"Boggessc\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boggess KA | title = Maternal oral health in pregnancy | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 111 | issue = 4 | pages = 976\u201386 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18378759 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e31816a49d3 }}</ref> In addition, other maternal factors such as social, behavioral, and biological factors can predispose a child's experience with tooth-decay.<ref name=\"Boggessa\" /> Some of these factors include the lack of knowledge a mother possesses concerning oral health, which can influence the development of caries among her children. Compared to children whose mothers have good oral health, children whose mothers have bad oral health are five times as likely to have poor oral health.<ref name=\"National\" /> Poor maintenance of oral health has profound implications on the development of children. As mentioned in the Surgeon's General Report, oral health affects the quality of life, especially children, with respect to functional, psychological, economic, and overall emotional well-being of an individual.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" /> To demonstrate the adverse effects of poor oral health, take for example the consequences a simple cavity can have on a child. First, it is painful. This might cause a child to miss school or have poor concentration, eventually compromising school performance. In addition, due to the pain, it might result in poor weight gain or growth. Also, children may exhibit reduced self-esteem because of cosmetic issues. Furthermore, it can affect language and impair speech. Impaired speech development can also result in low self-esteem. Finally, cavities although easily preventable, can pose a financial burden of a family. Public dental services are scarce and costly to individuals who lack dental insurance. It may also result in unwarranted visits to emergency department. Poor oral health permeates into other aspects of life, posing threats to overall well-being, if not handled timely and effectively\n\nThe significance of oral health is apparent, however, many women do not receive dental services before, during, and after pregnancy, even with obvious signs of oral disease.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\" /> There are several factors at play regarding pregnant women not seeking dental care, including the role of the health care system and disposition of the woman herself. There is a common misconception that it is not safe to obtain dental services while pregnant. Many prenatal and oral health providers have limited knowledge about the impact and safety of delivering dental services; hence they might delay or withhold treatment during pregnancy.<ref name=\"Dental\" /> Moreover, some prenatal providers are not aware of the importance of oral health on overall general health, thus failing to refer their patients to dental providers.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\" /> First and foremost, the misconception regarding the impact of dental services while a woman is pregnant needs to be purged. There is a consensus that prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral diseases are highly beneficial and can be performed on pregnant women having no added fetal or maternal risk when compared to the risk of providing no oral care.<ref name=\"OHRC Consensus Statement\" />  Equally important is establishing collaboration among clinicians, especially maternal health providers, with other dental providers. There should be coordination among general health and oral health providers, especially because of the interdependence of the two fields.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" />  Thus, it is imperative to educate and train health providers of the significance of oral health, designing methods to incorporate in their respective practices. Providers most provide education to pregnant women addressing the importance of oral health, because these women ultimately control the fate of themselves and their offspring. For example, providers can illustrate to mothers how to reduce cavities by wiping down the gums of their children with a soft cloth after breastfeeding or bottle-feeding.<ref name=\"Dental\" /> Bestowing knowledge and practical applications of good oral health maintenance measures to mothers can help improve overall health of the mother and child.  \nThere are still other factors in play when analyzing the low use of dental services by pregnant women, particularly prevalent among ethnic and racial minorities. A major factor is the lack of insurance and or access to dental services.<ref name=\"Surgeon\" /> For this reason, more data needs to be collected and analyzed so that programs are set up to effectively to reach all segments of the population.\n\n=== Race, Ethnicity and Maternal Health ===\nThe pregnancy related mortality ratio (PRMR) represents the number of deaths per 100,000 live births resulting from pregnancy or pregnancy related causes. Analysis of the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), indicates significant racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy related deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System {{!}} Maternal and Infant Health {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm|date=2020-02-04|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Specifically, A 2019 report from the CDC shows that the PRMRs of Black women and American Indian women in the United States are 3-4 times higher than that of White women. For White women during 2019, there were an approximate 13 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. For Black and American Indian women, there were 41 and 30 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births respectively. The majority of these deaths were due to preventable diseases associated with pregnancy related mortality, such as hypertension. While the fatality rate of these diseases was higher among Black and American Indian women, the initial prevalence was generally the same across all races.<ref name=\":022\">{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Emily E.|date=2019|title=Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Pregnancy-Related Deaths \u2014 United States, 2007\u20132016|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6835a3.htm|journal=MMWR.

They say that most pregnancy related deaths are the combined result of 3-4 contributing factors. For Black and American Indian women, this can include issues of implicit racial bias held by healthcare providers, which affects the quality of care given to treat or prevent a fatal disease. These factors can also be more structural (e.g. the gap in access to primary and preventative care in minority communities). In the CDC report, economic status is not cited as a leading cause of maternal mortality. While economic status and education level is a possible contributing factors to maternal mortality, the racial gap is shown to persist across all economic and education levels.<ref name=\":022\" />\n\n=== Religion and Maternal Health ===\nThere are many factors that influence maternal health and the utilization of resources that women have access to. One of these factors that recent studies have highlighted is religion. A study that took place in St John\u2019s, Canada researched how immigrant Muslims living in the area were treated and given maternal care.<ref name=\":2\">Reitmanova, Sylvia; Gustafson, Diana L. (2008-01-01). \"\"They Can't Understand It\": Maternity Health and Care Needs of Immigrant Muslim Women in St. John's, Newfoundland\". ''Maternal and Child Health Journal''.

[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 1573-6628</ref> Due to the insensitivity and lack of knowledge that the doctors showed these Muslim women, their health information and treatment suffered.<ref name=\":2\" /> The information did not contain anything based on their religious or cultural practices and did little to provide cultural adjustments and emotional support.<ref name=\":2\" /> The maternity health care and practices did nothing to meet the needs of the Muslim women who put their lives into the hands of these doctors. In order to provide a safer and more comfortable environment for Muslim women, it was proven that they needed more support that would connect with the immigrant community and health-related information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Discrimination based on religion is definitely a factor that effects the maternal health and health care of women from different backgrounds. It is evident that there needs to be proactive steps to adjust some of the mainstream practices to improve all maternal health. There is not a lot of discussion regarding the studies that reflect the hardships that women go through based on maternal care in terms of religion. Instead, there is a lot of stigma and norms regarding all religion that in turn place women at risk when receiving health-care.<ref>M\u00e5lqvist, Mats (2015-12-24). \"Preserving misconceptions or a call for action? \u2013 A hermeneutic re-reading of the Nativity story\".
