He was abducted on May 11, 1960 and taken to a hideout. He was subsequently smuggled to Israel, where he was [[tried]] and executed. Argentina protested what it considered as the violation of its sovereignty, and the [[United Nations]] [[Security Council]] noted that \"repetition of acts such as [this] would involve a breach of the principles upon which international order is founded, creating an atmosphere of insecurity and distrust incompatible with the preservation of peace\" while also acknowledging that \"Eichmann should be brought to appropriate justice for the crimes of which he is accused\" and that \"this resolution should in no way be interpreted as condoning the odious crimes of which Eichmann is accused.\"<ref>Argentina claimed that the \"illicit and clandestine transfer of Eichmann from Argentine territory constitutes a flagrant violation of the Argentine State's right of sovereignty[.]\" Bass, Gary J.

Ben Gurion wanted a central body to coordinate and improve cooperation between the existing security services\u2014the army's intelligence department (AMAN), the Internal Security Service (''Shin Bet''), and the foreign office's \"political department\".

The motto was later changed to another Proverbs passage: ''be-'\u00e9yn tachb\u016bl\u014dt yippol `\u0101m; \u016b-tesh\u016b`\u0101h be-rov y\u014d'\u00e9ts'' ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc \u05e2\u05dd, \u05d5\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e2\u05e5}}, Proverbs 11:14).

A team of five Mossad agents led by Shimon Ben Aharon slipped into Argentina and through [[surveillance]], confirmed that he had been living there under the name of Ricardo Klement. He was abducted on May 11, 1960 and taken to a hideout. He was subsequently smuggled to Israel, where he was [[tried]] and executed. Argentina protested what it considered as the violation of its sovereignty, and the [[United Nations]] [[Security Council]] noted that \"repetition of acts such as [this] would involve a breach of the principles upon which international order is founded, creating an atmosphere of insecurity and distrust incompatible with the preservation of peace\" while also acknowledging that \"Eichmann should be brought to appropriate justice for the crimes of which he is accused\" and that \"this resolution should in no way be interpreted as condoning the odious crimes of which Eichmann is accused.\"<ref>Argentina claimed that the \"illicit and clandestine transfer of Eichmann from Argentine territory constitutes a flagrant violation of the Argentine State's right of sovereignty[.]\" Bass, Gary J.
