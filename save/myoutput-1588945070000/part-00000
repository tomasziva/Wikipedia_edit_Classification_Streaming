The twins serve as showrunners and are executive producers along with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Sadie Sink]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations (and six wins), four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.

The brothers started by using a copy of Stephen King's ''[[Firestarter (novel)|Firestarter]]'' novel to consider the title's font and appearance, and came up with a long list of potential alternatives. ''Stranger Things'' came about as it sounded similar to another King novel, ''[[Needful Things]]'', though Matt noted they still had a \"lot of heated arguments\" over this final title.<ref name=\"daily beast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/07/inside-stranger-things-the-duffer-bros-on-how-they-made-the-tv-hit-of-the-summer.html |title=Inside 'Stranger Things': The Duffer Bros. on How They Made the TV Hit of the Summer |first=Melissa |last=Leon |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |website=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref>\n\nTo pitch the series, the Duffer Brothers showcased images, footage and music from classic 1970s and 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', ''[[Hellraiser]]'', ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', in order to establish the tone of the series.<ref name=\"Miyamoto\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe idea of ''Stranger Things'' started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film ''[[Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners]]'', detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://frightfind.com/stranger-things-netflix-homage/ |title=Stranger Things is an Homage to the Greats |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |website=FrightFind |date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> crafting it in the realm of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/stranger-things-and-the-get-down-reviews |title=On Television: \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down\" |first=Emily |last=Nassbaum |date=August 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: [[Stephen King]] novels; films produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven]],<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/duffer-brothers-talk-stranger-things-916180 |title=The Duffer Brothers Talk 'Stranger Things' Influences, 'It' Dreams and Netflix Phase 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"screenertv\">{{cite web |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/stranger-things-stephen-king-steven-spielberg-cinematic-influences/ |title=The cinematic influences behind Netflix's 'Stranger Things' |date=July 18, 2016 |work=ScreenerTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/13/how-netflixs-stranger-things-channels-steven-spielberg-john-carpenter-and-stephen-king/ |title=How Netflix's ''Stranger Things'' Channels Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King |first=Sarene |last=Leeds |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Guillermo del Toro]];<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"screenertv\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/stranger-things-all-the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-references-in-p/stand-by-me/ |title=Stranger Things: all the hidden (and not-so-hidden) movie, TV and book references |website=The Telegraph |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Japanese [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> and several [[video game]]s including ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, Stranger Things' Upside Down was totally inspired by Silent Hill |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-stranger-things-upside-down-was-totally-inspired-by-silent-hill/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=How Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us Influenced Stranger Things |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/how-silent-hill-dark-souls-and-the-last-of-us-influenced-stranger-things |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including ''[[Beyond the Black Rainbow]]'' and ''[[D.A.R.Y.L.]]'', discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.<ref name=\"hwr montauk\" /> Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-21-80s-relics-weve-spotted-so-far-photos/ |title=''Stranger Things'': 21 '80s Relics We've Spotted So Far |first=Meriah |last=Doty |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html |title=A ''Stranger Things'' Glossary: Every Major Film Reference in the Show, From A\u2013Z |last=Tobias |first=Scott |website=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomhowdy.com/filmtv/stranger-things-influences/ |title=Strange Influences: Our Favorite Movie References From ''Stranger Things'' |first=Tyree |last=Kimber |website=Boomhowdy.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18481-netflix-stranger-things-80s-pop-culture-references-spielberg |title=Every '80s Pop Culture References in ''Stranger Things'' |first=Sean |last=Hutchinson |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach.

Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' because it \"was a perfect match because both [''Stranger Things'' and ''Zelda''] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

The twins serve as showrunners and are executive producers along with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities.

Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]].

It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The game uses a [[Pixel art|retro-pixel]] style of art, similar to games for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is loosely based on the ''Stranger Things'' story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' because it \"was a perfect match because both [''Stranger Things'' and ''Zelda''] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.
