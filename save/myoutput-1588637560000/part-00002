After two days of failed attempts to sail south against the strong winter seas, they returned to the safety of the harbor, known today as [[Provincetown Harbor]], and set anchor.

The collected fees were used to defray the costs of schools and other projects throughout the colony. In 1678, the fishing grounds were opened up to allow the inclusion of fishermen from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1890|p=961}}\n\nIn 1692, a new [[Royal Charter]] combined the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies into the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. \"Cape Cod\" was thus officially renamed the \"Province Lands\".<ref name=\"PT-Hist\" />\n\nThe first record of a municipal government with jurisdiction over the Province Lands was in 1714, with an Act that declared it the \"'''Precinct of''' Cape Cod\", annexed under control of Truro.{{sfn|Hopkins|1890|p=963}}\n\nOn June 14, 1727, after harboring ships for more than a century, the Precinct of Cape Cod was incorporated as a township. The name chosen by its inhabitants was \"Herringtown\", which was rejected by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in favor of \"Provincetown\".{{sfn|Hopkins|1890|p=965}} The act of incorporation provided that inhabitants of Provincetown could be land holders, but not land owners. They received a [[quit claim]] to their property, but the Province retained the title. The land was to be used as it had been from the beginning of the colony \u2014 a place for the making of fish. All resources, including the trees, could be used for that purpose.<ref name=\"PT-Hist\" /> In 1893 the [[Massachusetts General Court]] changed the Town's charter, giving the townspeople deeds to the properties they held, while still reserving unoccupied areas.{{sfn|Greene|Sachse|McCauley|2006|p=163}}\n\nThe population of Provincetown remained small through most of the 18th century.\n\n[[File:Pilgrim-cape-cod.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Pilgrim Monument]], designed by [[Willard T.

It was, by happenstance, the location of the wreck of a British warship, [[HMS Somerset (1748)|''HMS Somerset'']] at the Peaked Hill Bars off the Atlantic Coast of Provincetown in 1778.\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, Provincetown grew rapidly as a fishing and [[whaling]] center.{{sfn|Hopkins|1890|p=961}} The population was bolstered by numerous [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors, many of whom were from the [[Azores]],<ref>Karen Christel Krahulik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xg0JnSRelVQC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51 ''Provincetown: From Pilgrim Landing to Gay Resort''], NYU Press, 2007, p. 51.</ref> and settled in Provincetown after being hired to work on US ships.\n\n[[File:Provincetown 1940 Art Class.jpg|thumb|Beachfront art class, 1940]]\n\nBy the 1890s, Provincetown was booming, and began to develop a resident population of writers and artists, as well as a summer tourist industry. After the 1898 [[Portland Gale]] severely damaged the town's fishing industry, members of the town's art community took over many of the abandoned buildings. By the early decades of the 20th century, the town had acquired an international reputation for its artistic and literary productions. The [[Provincetown Players]] was an important experimental theatre company formed during this period. Many of its members lived during other parts of the year in [[Greenwich Village]] in New York, and intellectual and artistic connections were woven between the places. In 1898 [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] opened the Cape Cod School of Art, said to be the first outdoor school for figure painting, in Provincetown. Film of his class from 1916 has been preserved.<ref>{{cite AV media |year=1916 |title=Provincetown artist colony (excerpt feat.

The town's rural character appealed to the [[hippies]] of the era; property was relatively cheap and rents were correspondingly low, especially during the winter. Many of those who came stayed and raised families. Commercial Street, the town's equivalent to \"[[Main Street]]\", gained numerous caf\u00e9s, leather shops, [[head shop]]s \u2013 various hip small businesses blossomed and many flourished.\n\nBy the 1970s Provincetown had a significant gay population, especially during the summer tourist season, when restaurants, bars and small shops serving the tourist trade were open. There had been a gay presence in Provincetown as early as the start of the 20th century as the [[art colony|artists' colony]] developed, along with experimental theatre. Drag queens could be seen in performance as early as the 1940s in Provincetown. In 1978 the Provincetown Business Guild (PBG) was formed to promote [[gay tourism]]. Today more than 200 businesses belong to the PBG, and Provincetown is perhaps the best-known gay summer resort on the East Coast. The 2010 US Census revealed Provincetown to have the highest rate of same-sex couples in the country, at 163.1 per 1000 couples.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/08/25/us/same-sex-couples-since-1990.html?ref=us \"Same-Sex Couples Since 1990\"], ''[[New York Times]]'', August 24, 2011</ref>\n\nSince the 1990s, property prices have risen significantly, causing some residents economic hardship.

Until the late 19th century, no road led to Provincetown \u2013 the only land route connecting the village to points back toward the mainland was along a thin stretch of beach along the shore to the north (known locally as the \"backshore\").<ref name=\"1836Map\"/> A wooden bridge was erected over the East Harbor in 1854, only to be destroyed by a winter storm and ice two years later.{{sfnp|Jennings|1890|p=197}} Although the bridge was replaced the following year, any traveler who crossed it still needed to traverse several miles over sand routes, which, together with the backshore route, was occasionally washed out by storms. This made Provincetown very much like an island. Its residents relied almost entirely upon its harbor for its communication, travel, and commerce needs.<ref name=KHL>{{cite web|last=Theriault|first=Wor.

It provided an easy means for fishermen to offload their vessels and ship their catch to the cities by rail.\n\nThe railroad was not the only late arrival to Provincetown. Even roads ''within'' the town were slow to be constructed: \n{{quote|\"There was then no road through the town. With no carts, carriages, wagons, horses or oxen, why a road? ... Here every man had a path from his house to his boat or vessel, and once launched, he was on the broad highway of nations without tax or toll. There were paths to the neighbors, paths to school, paths to church; tortuous paths perhaps, but they were good pilots by night or day, on land or water. Besides, at low water there was a road such as none else could boast, washed completely twice a day from year to year, wide enough and free enough and long enough, if followed, for the armies of the Netherlands.\"|Shebnah Rich| ''Truro&mdash;Cape Cod. Or, Land Marks and Sea Marks'' (1883){{sfnp|Rich|1883|p=457}}}}\n\nThe town's internal road layout reflects the historic importance of the waterfront, the key to communication and commerce with the outside world. As the town grew, it organically expanded along the harborfront. The main \"thoroughfare\" was the hard-packed beach, where all commerce and socializing took place. Early deeds refer to a \"Town Rode\", which was little more than a footpath that ran behind the houses. In 1835, County Commissioners turned that into \"Front Street\", now known as Commercial Street. \"Back Street\" ran parallel to Front Street, but was set back from the harbor&nbsp;\u2212 today it is known as Bradford Street. \n{{quote|\"The houses faced the water then; since then some of the houses have been turned around; some of them still have the front door on the shore side. One man, a doctor, who had not lived long in town, proposed that the street be made sixty-four feet wide, but they soon voted down such foolishness as that from foreigners. He tried to compromise on thirty-two feet, but twenty-two feet seemed wide enough for all possible purposes, and twenty-two feet wide it is.\"|Nancy W.

In 1678, the fishing grounds were opened up to allow the inclusion of fishermen from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1890|p=961}}\n\nIn 1692, a new [[Royal Charter]] combined the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies into the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. \"Cape Cod\" was thus officially renamed the \"Province Lands\".<ref name=\"PT-Hist\" />\n\nThe first record of a municipal government with jurisdiction over the Province Lands was in 1714, with an Act that declared it the \"'''Precinct of''' Cape Cod\", annexed under control of Truro.{{sfn|Hopkins|1890|p=963}}\n\nOn June 14, 1727, after harboring ships for more than a century, the Precinct of Cape Cod was incorporated as a township.

It was, by happenstance, the location of the wreck of a British warship, [[HMS Somerset (1748)|''HMS Somerset'']] at the Peaked Hill Bars off the Atlantic Coast of Provincetown in 1778.\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, Provincetown grew rapidly as a fishing and [[whaling]] center.{{sfn|Hopkins|1890|p=961}} The population was bolstered by numerous [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors, many of whom were from the [[Azores]],<ref>Karen Christel Krahulik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xg0JnSRelVQC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51 ''Provincetown: From Pilgrim Landing to Gay Resort''], NYU Press, 2007, p. 51.</ref> and settled in Provincetown after being hired to work on US ships.\n\n[[File:Provincetown 1940 Art Class.jpg|thumb|Beachfront art class, 1940]]\n\nBy the 1890s, Provincetown was booming, and began to develop a resident population of writers and artists, as well as a summer tourist industry. After the 1898 [[Portland Gale]] severely damaged the town's fishing industry, members of the town's art community took over many of the abandoned buildings. By the early decades of the 20th century, the town had acquired an international reputation for its artistic and literary productions. The [[Provincetown Players]] was an important experimental theatre company formed during this period. Many of its members lived during other parts of the year in [[Greenwich Village]] in New York, and intellectual and artistic connections were woven between the places. In 1898 [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] opened the Cape Cod School of Art, said to be the first outdoor school for figure painting, in Provincetown.

The town's rural character appealed to the [[hippies]] of the era; property was relatively cheap and rents were correspondingly low, especially during the winter. Many of those who came stayed and raised families. Commercial Street, the town's equivalent to \"[[Main Street]]\", gained numerous caf\u00e9s, leather shops, [[head shop]]s \u2013 various hip small businesses blossomed and many flourished.\n\nBy the 1970s Provincetown had a significant gay population, especially during the summer tourist season, when restaurants, bars and small shops serving the tourist trade were open. There had been a gay presence in Provincetown as early as the start of the 20th century as the [[art colony|artists' colony]] developed, along with experimental theatre. Drag queens could be seen in performance as early as the 1940s in Provincetown. In 1978 the Provincetown Business Guild (PBG) was formed to promote [[gay tourism]]. Today more than 200 businesses belong to the PBG, and Provincetown is perhaps the best-known gay summer resort on the East Coast.

An additional element of Provincetown's geography tremendously influenced the manner in which the town evolved: the town was physically isolated, being at the hard-to-reach tip of a long, narrow [[peninsula]].\n\nThe East Harbor, which provided the most protected mooring place in Provincetown, had a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|0}} inlet from Provincetown Harbor, and effectively blocked off access to Provincetown by land. Until the late 19th century, no road led to Provincetown \u2013 the only land route connecting the village to points back toward the mainland was along a thin stretch of beach along the shore to the north (known locally as the \"backshore\").<ref name=\"1836Map\"/> A wooden bridge was erected over the East Harbor in 1854, only to be destroyed by a winter storm and ice two years later.{{sfnp|Jennings|1890|p=197}} Although the bridge was replaced the following year, any traveler who crossed it still needed to traverse several miles over sand routes, which, together with the backshore route, was occasionally washed out by storms. This made Provincetown very much like an island. Its residents relied almost entirely upon its harbor for its communication, travel, and commerce needs.<ref name=KHL>{{cite web|last=Theriault|first=Wor.

As the town grew, it organically expanded along the harborfront. The main \"thoroughfare\" was the hard-packed beach, where all commerce and socializing took place. Early deeds refer to a \"Town Rode\", which was little more than a footpath that ran behind the houses. In 1835, County Commissioners turned that into \"Front Street\", now known as Commercial Street. \"Back Street\" ran parallel to Front Street, but was set back from the harbor&nbsp;\u2212 today it is known as Bradford Street. \n{{quote|\"The houses faced the water then; since then some of the houses have been turned around; some of them still have the front door on the shore side. One man, a doctor, who had not lived long in town, proposed that the street be made sixty-four feet wide, but they soon voted down such foolishness as that from foreigners. He tried to compromise on thirty-two feet, but twenty-two feet seemed wide enough for all possible purposes, and twenty-two feet wide it is.\"|Nancy W.
