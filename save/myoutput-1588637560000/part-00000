His family moved to the United States when he was ten years old. After graduating from [[California State University, Northridge]] with a degree in graphic arts, Hartman designed album covers for bands including [[Poco]] and [[America (band)|America]]. In 1975, Hartman joined the comedy group [[The Groundlings]], where he helped comedian [[Paul Reubens]] develop his character, [[Pee-wee Herman]]. Hartman co-wrote the film ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' and made recurring appearances as Captain Carl on Reubens's show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Hartman joined the [[NBC]] sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He won fame for his impressions and stayed on the show for eight seasons until 1994. Nicknamed the \"Glue\" for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, Hartman won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his ''SNL'' work in 1989. In 1995 he starred as Bill McNeal in the sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]'' after scrapping plans for a return to ''SNL'',  He also voiced various characters on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and had minor roles in the films ''[[Houseguest]]'', ''[[Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'', ''[[Small Soldiers]]'', and the English dub of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''.\n\nHartman was divorced twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987, with whom he had two children. Their marriage was troubled by Brynn's <!--She took the surname Hartman after her marriage, thus, per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)#Family members with the same surname]], is referred to as \"Brynn\" from now on.--> drug use and Phil's constant absence from home. In 1998, Hartman was shot dead by his wife, who committed suicide 12 hours later. In the weeks following his murder, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' opined that Hartman was \"the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with.\"<ref name=\"ew\"/> Hartman was posthumously inducted into the [[Canada's Walk of Fame|Canadian]] and [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Hollywood]] Walks of Fame in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:PocoBand07.jpg|thumb|Hartman designed album covers for bands such as [[Poco]].]]\nPhil Hartman was born Philip Edward Hartmann (later dropping one \"n\")<ref name=\"cbs profile\"/> on September 24, 1948, in [[Brantford, Ontario]].<ref name=\"bookof\"/><ref name=\"atlanta\">{{cite news|title=Phil Hartman: An appreciation \u2013 he became anybody he wanted|date=May 29, 1998|author=V.

His family moved to the United States when he was ten years old. After graduating from [[California State University, Northridge]] with a degree in graphic arts, Hartman designed album covers for bands including [[Poco]] and [[America (band)|America]]. In 1975, Hartman joined the comedy group [[The Groundlings]], where he helped comedian [[Paul Reubens]] develop his character, [[Pee-wee Herman]]. Hartman co-wrote the film ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' and made recurring appearances as Captain Carl on Reubens's show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Hartman joined the [[NBC]] sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He won fame for his impressions and stayed on the show for eight seasons until 1994. Nicknamed the \"Glue\" for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, Hartman won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his ''SNL'' work in 1989. In 1995, after scrapping another plans for ''SNL'', he starred as Bill McNeal in the sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]''. He also voiced various characters on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and had minor roles in the films ''[[Houseguest]]'', ''[[Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'', ''[[Small Soldiers]]'', and the English dub of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''.\n\nHartman was divorced twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987, with whom he had two children. Their marriage was troubled by Brynn's <!--She took the surname Hartman after her marriage, thus, per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)#Family members with the same surname]], is referred to as \"Brynn\" from now on.--> drug use and Phil's constant absence from home. In 1998, Hartman was shot dead by his wife, who later committed suicide. In the weeks following his murder, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' opined that Hartman was \"the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with.\"<ref name=\"ew\"/> Hartman was posthumously inducted into the [[Canada's Walk of Fame|Canadian]] and [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Hollywood]] Walks of Fame in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:PocoBand07.jpg|thumb|Hartman designed album covers for bands such as [[Poco]].]]\nPhil Hartman was born Philip Edward Hartmann (later dropping one \"n\")<ref name=\"cbs profile\"/> on September 24, 1948, in [[Brantford, Ontario]].<ref name=\"bookof\"/><ref name=\"atlanta\">{{cite news|title=Phil Hartman: An appreciation \u2013 he became anybody he wanted|date=May 29, 1998|author=V.
