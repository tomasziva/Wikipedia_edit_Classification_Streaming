It originally ran from 1986 to 1993. A revival ran in 2000, and the most recent revival aired from 2018 to 2019.\n\nHosted by [[Marc Summers]], the program originally premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] on October 6, 1986, as its first game show. The series saw many adjustments in scheduling and titling throughout its run. Almost immediately after its debut, ''Double Dare'' had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon's afternoon lineup, becoming the most-watched original daily program on [[cable television]]. The program was a major success for Nickelodeon, helping to establish the network as a major player in cable television, and to revitalize the genre of game shows for children. ''Double Dare'' remains Nickelodeon's longest-running game show. In January 2001, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows.\n\nA continuation for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' on January 22, 1989. The program also had a short run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] as ''Family Double Dare'', airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued ''Family Double Dare'', premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 6, 1993. The series was revived, hosted by [[Jason Harris Katz|Jason Harris]], and titled ''Double Dare 2000''; this aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000. A second revival of the series, hosted by [[Liza Koshy]] and featuring Marc Summers, premiered on June 25, 2018. The second revival series ended on December 20, 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Main game===\nEach team on the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' consisted of two children, while teams on ''Family Double Dare'' and ''Double Dare 2000'' included two adults and two children.<ref name=\"DD2k\"/> Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after ''Double Dare'' entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red.<ref name=\"86 episode\"/><ref name=\"FDD\"/>\n\nEach round begins with a toss-up physical challenge in which both teams compete, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host begins asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earns a monetary award, and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control is challenged to a double dare, they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it. The second round plays the same as the first, with question values doubled.<ref name=\"86 episode\">{{cite episode|title=Prosecutors vs. Mad Avengers|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=1986}}</ref><ref name=\"EOTGS\"/><ref name=collins/> On the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', a question was initially worth $10. On ''Family Double Dare'' and ''Double Dare 2000'', a question was initially worth $25. On the 2018 ''Double Dare'', a question was initially worth $50, later 50 points.<ref name=\"86 episode\"/><ref name=\"FDD\"/><ref name=\"DD2k premiere\">{{cite episode|series=Double Dare 2000|title=100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd vs. The Amanda Show|network=Nickelodeon|date=January 22, 2000}}</ref><ref name=\"18 premiere\">{{cite episode|series=Double Dare|title=The Mad Dogs vs. Line Drive 25|network=Nickelodeon|date=June 25, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"19 premiere\"/>\n\nAfter the toss-up at the start of the first round, the host explains the rules as follows:\n\n{{cquote|I'm going to ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, or think the other team hasn't got a clue, you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars. But, be careful, because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount, and then you either have to answer that question or take the physical challenge.<ref name=\"FDD\">{{cite episode|title=McGoldrick vs. O'Donnell|series=Family Double Dare|network=Fox|date=April 3, 1988}}</ref><ref name=\"18 premiere\"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=Wildcats vs. Mighty Midgets|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 13, 1987}}</ref><ref name=\"1992 show\">{{cite episode|series=NBA All-Star Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 8, 1992}}</ref>}}\n\n===Physical challenges===\n[[File:Family Double Dare spaghetti challenge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 1990 ''Family Double Dare'' toss-up physical challenge showing two contestants trying to catch a \"meatball\" in a bowl of \"spaghetti.\"]]\nPhysical challenges are often messy stunts<ref name=\"DD2k\"/> that a team has to perform in a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical challenges on ''Double Dare 2000'' were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team wins money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control pass to their opponents.<ref name=\"EOTGS\"/>\n\nMany challenges have involved filling a container past a line with one of a variety of substances including water, uncooked rice, green slime, whipped cream, and milk. Others involve catching a specific number of items before time runs out. For example, during \"Pies in the Pants,\" a contestant has to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit, while their teammate launches the pies from a foot-operated catapult at the opposite end of the stage.<ref>{{cite news|last=King |first=Susan |title=Marc Summers: Kidding Around, Seriously |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |date=August 25, 1991 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411140547/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |archivedate=April 11, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOn the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', both contestants on a team competed in all physical challenges. For the 1988 version of ''Family Double Dare'', all four members of a team competed in the challenges. On the 1990\u201393 version of ''Family Double Dare'' and on ''Double Dare 2000'', two members of a team competed in round one, and all four members competed in round two. All members of a team competed in physical challenges in the first season of the 2018 ''Double Dare'', while most challenges in the second season are for two players.<ref name=\"86 episode\"/><ref name=\"FDD\"/><ref name=\"DD2k premiere\"/><ref name=\"19 premiere\"/><ref name=\"1992 show\"/><ref name=\"Triplets\">{{cite episode|series=Double Dare|title=Team Triple Threat vs. Wonder Triplet Power|network=Nickelodeon|date=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Double Dare 2000'' introduced the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed a team to make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.<ref name=\"DD2k\"/>\n\n===Obstacle course===\n[[File:Double Dare - Obstacle Course - Slide (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Sundae Slide being prepared on a 1987 ''Double Dare'' obstacle course.]]\nThe team with the highest score at the end of round two goes on to the bonus round, the [[obstacle course]] (renamed the Slopstacle Course for ''Double Dare 2000''). From the original ''Double Dare'' through ''Double Dare 2000'' both teams keep all money earned, regardless of the outcome.<ref name=\"1992 show\"/> Only the winning team on the 2018 version gets to keep their money while the losing team get a prize package and dont keep their money.<ref name=\"18 premiere\"/>\n\nThe course consists of eight obstacles which have to be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle has an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member runs the first obstacle, then passes its flag to a partner, who then moves on to the next obstacle. The team continues to alternate in this manner until they have completed the course or until time expires.<ref name=\"EOTGS\"/> For safety reasons, team members are given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.<ref name=Boys/>\n\nMany obstacles have appeared in the course rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life.<ref name=Floss>{{cite magazine|title=The 10 Slimiest Stunts of Double Dare |magazine=[[Mental Floss]] |last=Rossen |first=Jake |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/67581/no-small-splatter-10-slimiest-stunts-double-dare |date=August 20, 2015 |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309061028/http://mentalfloss.com/article/67581/no-small-splatter-10-slimiest-stunts-double-dare |archivedate=March 9, 2017 }}</ref> Popular elements of the obstacle course have included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized [[hamster wheel]]; Pick It, a giant [[human nose]] with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a [[playground slide]] with [[ice cream]] at the bottom; and Gum Drop, which required contestants to leap into a giant [[gumball machine]] filled with plastic balls and slide out through the dispensing hatch at the bottom.<ref name=Floss/><ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite web|last=Eakin|first=Marah|title=\"It smelled like death\": An oral history of the Double Dare obstacle course|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/it-smelled-death-oral-history-double-dare-obstacle-245939|work=[[The A.V.

Prizes have included televisions, concert tickets, encyclopedias, electronics, gift certificates, non-motorized modes of transportation and, on the Fox ''Family Double Dare'', cash.<ref name=collins/> On the original and ''Super Sloppy'' versions, the grand prize was usually a vacation or an experience at [[Space Camp (United States)|Space Camp]].

A revival ran in 2000, and the most recent revival aired from 2018 to 2019.\n\nHosted by [[Marc Summers]], the program originally premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] on October 6, 1986, as its first game show. The series saw many adjustments in scheduling and titling throughout its run. Almost immediately after its debut, ''Double Dare'' had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon's afternoon lineup, becoming the most-watched original daily program on [[cable television]]. The program was a major success for Nickelodeon, helping to establish the network as a major player in cable television, and to revitalize the genre of game shows for children. ''Double Dare'' remains Nickelodeon's longest-running game show. In January 2001, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows.\n\nA continuation for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' on January 22, 1989. The program also had a short run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] as ''Family Double Dare'', airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued ''Family Double Dare'', premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 6, 1993. The series was revived, hosted by [[Jason Harris Katz|Jason Harris]], and titled ''Double Dare 2000''; this aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000. A second revival of the series, hosted by [[Liza Koshy]] and featuring Marc Summers, premiered on June 25, 2018. The second revival series ended on December 20, 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Main game===\nEach team on the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' consisted of two children, while teams on ''Family Double Dare'' and ''Double Dare 2000'' included two adults and two children.<ref name=\"DD2k\"/> Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after ''Double Dare'' entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red.<ref name=\"86 episode\"/><ref name=\"FDD\"/>\n\nEach round begins with a toss-up physical challenge in which both teams compete, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host begins asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earns a monetary award, and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control is challenged to a double dare, they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it. The second round plays the same as the first, with question values doubled.<ref name=\"86 episode\">{{cite episode|title=Prosecutors vs. Mad Avengers|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=1986}}</ref><ref name=\"EOTGS\"/><ref name=collins/> On the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', a question was initially worth $10.

But, be careful, because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount, and then you either have to answer that question or take the physical challenge.<ref name=\"FDD\">{{cite episode|title=McGoldrick vs. O'Donnell|series=Family Double Dare|network=Fox|date=April 3, 1988}}</ref><ref name=\"18 premiere\"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=Wildcats vs. Mighty Midgets|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 13, 1987}}</ref><ref name=\"1992 show\">{{cite episode|series=NBA All-Star Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 8, 1992}}</ref>}}\n\n===Physical challenges===\n[[File:Family Double Dare spaghetti challenge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 1990 ''Family Double Dare'' toss-up physical challenge showing two contestants trying to catch a \"meatball\" in a bowl of \"spaghetti.\"]]\nPhysical challenges are often messy stunts<ref name=\"DD2k\"/> that a team has to perform in a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical challenges on ''Double Dare 2000'' were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team wins money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control pass to their opponents.<ref name=\"EOTGS\"/>\n\nMany challenges have involved filling a container past a line with one of a variety of substances including water, uncooked rice, green slime, whipped cream, and milk. Others involve catching a specific number of items before time runs out. For example, during \"Pies in the Pants,\" a contestant has to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit, while their teammate launches the pies from a foot-operated catapult at the opposite end of the stage.<ref>{{cite news|last=King |first=Susan |title=Marc Summers: Kidding Around, Seriously |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |date=August 25, 1991 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411140547/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |archivedate=April 11, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOn the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', both contestants on a team competed in all physical challenges.

Available only in round two, this allowed a team to make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.<ref name=\"DD2k\"/>\n\n===Obstacle course===\n[[File:Double Dare - Obstacle Course - Slide (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Sundae Slide being prepared on a 1987 ''Double Dare'' obstacle course.]]\nThe team with the highest score at the end of round two goes on to the bonus round, the [[obstacle course]] (renamed the Slopstacle Course for ''Double Dare 2000'').
