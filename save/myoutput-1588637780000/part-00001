Both forms have a single [[Body orifice|orifice]] and body cavity that are used for [[digestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Many cnidarian species produce [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]-like zooids, or both (hence they are [[Trimorphism|trimorphic]]).

Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth). \n\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with [[Cnidocyte|cnidocytes]] around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of [[zooid]]s that serve different purposes, such as defense, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of [[jet propulsion]].<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Skeletons===\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nIn some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Main cell layers===\nCnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the [[ectoderm]] (\"outside skin\"), generally contains the following types of cells:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form [[muscle]] fibers in parallel rows.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004MuscleTissue\">{{cite book| author1=Ruppert, E.E.| author2=Fox, R.S.| author3=Barnes, R.D.| last-author-amp=yes| title=Invertebrate Zoology| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=978-0-03-025982-1| year=2004| pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103 103\u2013104]| chapter=Introduction to Metazoa| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103}}</ref> The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one.

[[Sensory neuron|Sensory]] cells appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells,<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> and communicate via [[synapse]]s (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with [[motor nerve]] cells, which lie mostly between the bases of the muscle cells.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Some form a simple [[nerve net]].\n*Interstitial cells, which are unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by transforming into the appropriate types.

At least four hypotheses have been proposed:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.\n*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.\n*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the \"sea wasp\"), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].\n*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&nbsp;second).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Locomotion===\n[[File:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| A swimming sea nettle known as the purple-striped jelly (''[[Chrysaora colorata]]'')]]\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]s and some [[sea anemone]]s can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like [[Geometer moth|inchworm]]s, or by [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|somersault]]ing. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Nervous system and senses===\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures.<ref name=SatterlieCentral>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A.|date=15 April 2011|title=Do jellyfish have central nervous systems?|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=214|issue=8|pages=1215\u20131223|doi=10.1242/jeb.043687|issn=0022-0949|pmid=21430196|doi-access=free}}</ref> These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the motor nerve net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles. Most Cnidarians also have a parallel system. In scyphozoans, this takes the form of a diffuse nerve net, which has modulatory effects on the nervous system.<ref name=SatterlieControl>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A|date=2002-10-01|title=Neuronal control of swimming in jellyfish: a comparative story|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1654\u20131669|doi=10.1139/z02-132|issn=0008-4301|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be8fbb5d133e10d7e2bdd85989085b73bbee2c7e}}</ref> As well as forming the \"signal cables\" between sensory neurons and motoneurons, intermediate neurons in the nerve net can also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers. Communication between nerve cells can occur by chemical synapses or gap junctions in hydrozoans, though gap junctions are not present in all groups. Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as many animals, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass-Simon|first=G.|last2=Pierobon|first2=Paola|date=1 January 2007|title=Cnidarian chemical neurotransmission, an updated overview|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=146|issue=1|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.008|pmid=17101286}}</ref>\n\nThis structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.<ref name=SatterlieCentral/><ref name=SatterlieControl />\n\nMedusae and complex swimming colonies such as [[siphonophore]]s and [[chondrophore]]s sense tilt and acceleration by means of [[statocyst]]s, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing the strength of the swimming movements on the side that is too low. Most species have [[ocelli]] (\"simple eyes\"), which can detect sources of light. However, the agile [[box jellyfish]] are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have [[retinas]], [[cornea]]s and [[lens (anatomy)|lenses]].<ref name=\"live\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/7243-jellyfish-human-eyes.html|title=Jellyfish Have Human-Like Eyes|publisher=www.livescience.com|date=April 1, 2007|accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"live\" />\n\n===Feeding and excretion===\nCnidarians feed in several ways: [[predation]], absorbing dissolved [[organic matter|organic]] chemicals, [[filter feeding|filtering]] food particles out of the water, obtaining [[nutrients]] from [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nPredatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\n\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Respiration===\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nCnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]]. The animals produce large quantities of [[antioxidant]]s to neutralize the excess oxygen.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n===Regeneration===\nAll cnidarians can [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]]. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\n==Reproduction==\n{{Annotated image| float=right| caption=Life cycle of a [[jellyfish]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /><br>'''1\u20133''' Larva searches for site<br>'''4\u20138''' Polyp grows<br>'''9\u201311''' Polyp [[strobilation|strobilates]]<br>'''12\u201314''' Medusa grows| image=Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg| width=193| image-width=200| height=292| annot-font-weight=bold| annot-background-color=yellow| annot-font-size=10\n| annotations=\n{{Annotation|100|231|&nbsp;1&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|60|232|&nbsp;2&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|9|232|&nbsp;3&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|4|260|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|40|260|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|78|260|&nbsp;6&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|120|260|&nbsp;7&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|151|216|&nbsp;8&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|166|147|&nbsp;9&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|104|159|&nbsp;10&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|50|162|&nbsp;11&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|29|38|&nbsp;12&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|87|60|&nbsp;13&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n{{Annotation|161|62|&nbsp;14&nbsp;|background-color=#ffcccc}}\n}}\n\n===Sexual===\n\nCnidarian [[sexual reproduction]] often involves a complex life cycle with both [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]] stages. For example, in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a [[free-swimming]] medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually)<ref>Vernon A. Harris (1990). \"Hydroids\". ''Sessile animals of the sea shore''. Springer. p. 223, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbaBQm_ZQkIC&lpg=PA223&dq=alternation%20of%20generations%20cnidaria&hl=pt-BR&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=alternation%20of%20generation%20&f=false].</ref> is sometimes called \"alternation of asexual and sexual phases\" or \"metagenesis\", but should not be confused with the [[alternation of generations]] as found in plants.\n\nShortened forms of this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. [[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (''Turritopsis dohrnii''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/pdf/56/sm56n2137.pdf|title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|last = Bavestrello|date = 1992|journal = Scientia Marina|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and ''Laodicea undulata''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339\u2013346}}</ref>) and Scyphozoa (''Aurelia'' sp.1<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 21 December 2015|journal = PLOS One|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|pmc=4687044|volume=10|issue = 12|pages=e0145314|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1045314H}}</ref>). [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage&nbsp;\u2014 one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nAnthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Asexual===\nAll known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n==Classification==\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main [[class (biology)|classes]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the [[bilateria]]ns.<ref name=\"E.

The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which are limited to locations that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless, major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. [[Hydrozoan]]s have a worldwide range: some, such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', live in freshwater; ''[[Obelia]]'' appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and ''Liriope''<!--****** at present the DAB page does not link to a cnidarian called Liriope ******--> can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean.

In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"[[Planulozoa]]\" because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\">{{cite journal| author=Collins, A.G.| date=May 2002| title=Phylogeny of Medusozoa and the Evolution of Cnidarian Life Cycles| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| volume=15| issue=3| pages=418\u2013432| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00403.x| url=http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| accessdate=2008-11-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922080742/http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| archive-date=2006-09-22| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"WallbergEtAl2004PhylogeneticPositionOfCtenophora\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wallberg, A. | author2=Thollesson, M. | author3=Farris, J.S. | author4=Jondelius, U. |last-author-amp=yes\n| title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling\n| journal=Cladistics| volume=20| year=2004| pages=558\u2013578\n| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x\n| issue=6\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other \"Scyphozoa\". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\" /><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Marques, A.C. |author2=Collins, A.G.| year=2004\n| title=Cladistic analysis of Medusozoa and cnidarian evolution\n| journal=Invertebrate Biology| volume=123| issue=1| pages=23\u201342| doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x\n| url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=sourceget&id=38492| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]].

Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as \"oral\" (nearest the mouth) and \"aboral\" (furthest from the mouth). \n\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with [[Cnidocyte|cnidocytes]] around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of [[zooid]]s that serve different purposes, such as defense, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of [[jet propulsion]].<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Skeletons===\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nIn some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Main cell layers===\nCnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the [[ectoderm]] (\"outside skin\"), generally contains the following types of cells:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form [[muscle]] fibers in parallel rows.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004MuscleTissue\">{{cite book| author1=Ruppert, E.E.| author2=Fox, R.S.| author3=Barnes, R.D.| last-author-amp=yes| title=Invertebrate Zoology| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=978-0-03-025982-1| year=2004| pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103 103\u2013104]| chapter=Introduction to Metazoa| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821/page/103}}</ref> The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one.

[[Sensory neuron|Sensory]] cells appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells,<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> and communicate via [[synapse]]s (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with [[motor nerve]] cells, which lie mostly between the bases of the muscle cells.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Some form a simple [[nerve net]].\n*Interstitial cells, which are unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by transforming into the appropriate types.

Spirocysts do not have cilia.\n*A tough capsule, the [[cnida]], which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or [[adhesive]]s or both. (\"cnida\" is derived from the Greek word \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7, which means \"nettle\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| contribution=Cnida\n|author1=Trumble, W. |author2=Brown, L.\n| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2002\n}}</ref>)\n*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the \"finger\"'s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.\n*The thread, which is an extension of the \"finger\" and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.\n*An [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.\n*The cell body, which produces all the other parts.\n\nIt is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.\n*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.\n*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the \"sea wasp\"), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].\n*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&nbsp;second).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nCnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Locomotion===\n[[File:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| A swimming sea nettle known as the purple-striped jelly (''[[Chrysaora colorata]]'')]]\nMedusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]s and some [[sea anemone]]s can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like [[Geometer moth|inchworm]]s, or by [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|somersault]]ing. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Nervous system and senses===\nCnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures.<ref name=SatterlieCentral>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A.|date=15 April 2011|title=Do jellyfish have central nervous systems?|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=214|issue=8|pages=1215\u20131223|doi=10.1242/jeb.043687|issn=0022-0949|pmid=21430196|doi-access=free}}</ref> These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the motor nerve net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles. Most Cnidarians also have a parallel system. In scyphozoans, this takes the form of a diffuse nerve net, which has modulatory effects on the nervous system.<ref name=SatterlieControl>{{Cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A|date=2002-10-01|title=Neuronal control of swimming in jellyfish: a comparative story|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1654\u20131669|doi=10.1139/z02-132|issn=0008-4301|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be8fbb5d133e10d7e2bdd85989085b73bbee2c7e}}</ref> As well as forming the \"signal cables\" between sensory neurons and motoneurons, intermediate neurons in the nerve net can also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers. Communication between nerve cells can occur by chemical synapses or gap junctions in hydrozoans, though gap junctions are not present in all groups. Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as many animals, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kass-Simon|first=G.|last2=Pierobon|first2=Paola|date=1 January 2007|title=Cnidarian chemical neurotransmission, an updated overview|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology|volume=146|issue=1|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.008|pmid=17101286}}</ref>\n\nThis structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.<ref name=SatterlieCentral/><ref name=SatterlieControl />\n\nMedusae and complex swimming colonies such as [[siphonophore]]s and [[chondrophore]]s sense tilt and acceleration by means of [[statocyst]]s, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths.

Most species have [[ocelli]] (\"simple eyes\"), which can detect sources of light.

Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nPredatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The \"smell\" of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by \"oral arms\", which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.\n\nOnce the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nIndigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Respiration===\nThere are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nCnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]].

For example, in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nThis phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a [[free-swimming]] medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually)<ref>Vernon A. Harris (1990). \"Hydroids\". ''Sessile animals of the sea shore''. Springer. p. 223, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbaBQm_ZQkIC&lpg=PA223&dq=alternation%20of%20generations%20cnidaria&hl=pt-BR&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=alternation%20of%20generation%20&f=false].</ref> is sometimes called \"alternation of asexual and sexual phases\" or \"metagenesis\", but should not be confused with the [[alternation of generations]] as found in plants.\n\nShortened forms of this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. [[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (''Turritopsis dohrnii''<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/pdf/56/sm56n2137.pdf|title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|last = Bavestrello|date = 1992|journal = Scientia Marina|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and ''Laodicea undulata''<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339\u2013346}}</ref>) and Scyphozoa (''Aurelia'' sp.1<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 21 December 2015|journal = PLOS One|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|pmc=4687044|volume=10|issue = 12|pages=e0145314|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1045314H}}</ref>). [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nSpawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage&nbsp;\u2014 one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" />\n\nThe fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" /> The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the \"front\" end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\nAnthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n===Asexual===\nAll known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /><ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral\" />\n\n==Classification==\nCnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main [[class (biology)|classes]]:<ref name=\"Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson\" /> sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the [[bilateria]]ns.<ref name=\"E.

In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled \"[[Planulozoa]]\" because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\">{{cite journal| author=Collins, A.G.| date=May 2002| title=Phylogeny of Medusozoa and the Evolution of Cnidarian Life Cycles| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| volume=15| issue=3| pages=418\u2013432| doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00403.x| url=http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| accessdate=2008-11-27| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922080742/http://cima.uprm.edu/~n_schizas/CMOB_8676/Collins2002.pdf| archive-date=2006-09-22| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"WallbergEtAl2004PhylogeneticPositionOfCtenophora\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wallberg, A. | author2=Thollesson, M. | author3=Farris, J.S. | author4=Jondelius, U. |last-author-amp=yes\n| title=The phylogenetic position of the comb jellies (Ctenophora) and the importance of taxonomic sampling\n| journal=Cladistics| volume=20| year=2004| pages=558\u2013578\n| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00041.x\n| issue=6\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other \"Scyphozoa\". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.<ref name=\"Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa\" /><ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Marques, A.C. |author2=Collins, A.G.| year=2004\n| title=Cladistic analysis of Medusozoa and cnidarian evolution\n| journal=Invertebrate Biology| volume=123| issue=1| pages=23\u201342| doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x\n| url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=sourceget&id=38492| accessdate=2008-11-27\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]].
