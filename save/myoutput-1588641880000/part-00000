In the serial, the Marshal of Solos ([[Paul Whitsun-Jones]]) plots to change Solos' atmosphere to make it breathable for humans but not for the native Solonians. At the same time, the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Third Doctor]] ([[Jon Pertwee]]) delivers a set of tablets containing lost information about the Solonians' life cycle to the Solonian Ky ([[Garrick Hagon]]).\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=multiple|date=June 2017|\n {{Plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nIn the 30th century, the Earth Empire is contracting and plans are being made to decolonise the colony world of Solos. The militaristic Marshal and other human soldiers, known as Overlords, rule it from Skybase One, an orbiting [[space station]]. The Marshal opposes the decolonisation plans outlined to him by an Administrator sent from Earth, and is also obsessed with eradicating the Mutants or \"Mutts\" that have sprung up on the planet below. The Solonians themselves are a tribal people, split between those who actively oppose the occupation, such as Ky, and those like Varan who collaborate with the imperialists. Indeed, the Marshal and Varan ensure the Administrator is murdered before he can confirm to Ky and other tribal chiefs that the Earth Empire is indeed withdrawing from Solos.\n\nThe [[Third Doctor]] and [[Jo Grant|Jo]] arrive on Skybase One, their [[TARDIS]] having been transported there by the [[Time Lord]]s. They have with them a message box which will only open for an intended recipient \u2013 and that is not the Marshal or his entourage \u2013 but seems to be for Ky, who has been framed for the murder of the Administrator. Jo and Ky flee to the surface of Solos, which is poisonous to humans during daylight hours. This quickly affects Jo, but she survives with Ky's help. The Doctor learns from the Marshal and his chief scientist Jaeger that they are involved in an experiment using rocket barrages to [[terraforming|terraform]] Solos, making the air breathable for humans, regardless of the cost to indigenous life.\n\nVaran by now has discovered the Marshal's treachery but events make him an outlaw on Skybase. The Doctor makes contact and together they persuade Stubbs and Cotton, the most senior soldiers to the Marshal that much is wrong on Skybase. He then flees to Solos with Varan, and at the thaesium mine where Ky and Jo are hiding he encounters many Mutts, who are not as hostile as they first appeared. The Doctor passes the message box to Ky, and it opens to reveal ancient tablets and etchings which are written in the language of the Old Ones of the planet. Help in avoiding poisonous gas released by the Marshal is provided by a fugitive human scientist, Sondergaard, who lives in the caves and knows much about Solonian anthropology. Sondergaard explains he tried to inform Earth Control about the Marshal's evil, but he was prevented and forced to flee to the caves, where the radiation seems to have affected him. He interprets the contents of the box as a \"lost Solos Book of Genesis\", and the Doctor then calculates a Solonian year to be equivalent to two thousand human years, with natural changes in the population every five hundred years within the cycle. Investigating a more radioactive part of the caves, the Doctor thus deduces the Mutant phase is a natural part of the Solonian life-cycle.\n\nVaran is by now becoming a Mutt himself. He hides this fact and leads a Solonian attack on the Skybase which results in his death and those of many of his warriors. On Skybase Jo, Ky, Stubbs and Cotton are captured by the Marshal, and Stubbs is killed in a failed escape attempt. The Doctor meanwhile has returned to the Skybase \u2013 without Sondergaard, who seems too weak following the radiation contamination. He instead returns to the caves to communicate with the Mutants and explain to them their change is natural and not to be feared.\n\nThe Doctor is now back on Skybase and surmises the Marshal to be mad. It becomes clear that the Earth Government has now dispatched an Investigator to look into the strange events on Solos. The Marshal's rocket attacks have not terraformed the planet, but they have left a hideous environmental impact and he knows he must clean this up or face problems when the Investigator arrives. Under duress (the Marshal has taken Jo prisoner) the Doctor uses Jaeger's technology to conduct a rapid decontamination of the planet's surface. The Investigator arrives and demands answers, but is given more lies by the Marshal, supported by the Doctor. Luckily Jo, Ky and Cotton have escaped their detention and arrive in time to help the Investigator see the truth of the situation on Solos and the crimes of the Marshal and Jaeger. The Doctor accuses them of \"the most brutal and callous series of crimes against a defenceless people it's ever been my misfortunate to encounter.\" Sondergaard now reaches the Skybase with some Mutants, one of whom scares the Investigator enough that he accepts the Marshal's analysis that the creatures should be killed.\n\nKy now begins a process of mutation, but it is accelerated beyond the Mutant phase so that he emerges as a radiant angel-like super-being. He communicates with thought transference, can float and can move through whole walls. Dispensing justice, Ky eradicates the Marshal. Jaeger has been killed too and the Investigator now makes sense of the situation. Sondergaard and Cotton elect to stay on Solos to see the other Solonians go through the mutation process, while Jo and the Doctor slip away, their mission from the Time Lords complete.\n\n==Production==\nWorking titles for this story included ''Independence'' and ''The Emergents''.\n\nWriters Bob Baker and Dave Martin, as well as producer Barry Letts, intended for ''The Mutants'' to have an anti-racist message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J |authorlink=David J Howe |last2=Walker |first2=Stephen James |authorlink2=Stephen James Walker |year=1998 |title=Doctor Who: The Television Companion|publisher=BBC Worldwide Ltd}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC Classic\">{{cite web | title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/mutants/detail.shtml | publisher=BBC | accessdate=1 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe opening shot of the story features a bedraggled, hermit-like bearded figure (Sidney Johnson) shambling out of the mist towards the camera.
