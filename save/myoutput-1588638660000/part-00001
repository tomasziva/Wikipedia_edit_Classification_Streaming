Its eastern border is the [[Sea Islands]], a chain of tidal and [[barrier islands]]. The border between the low country and the up country is defined by the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]], which marks the limit of navigable rivers.\n\n====Atlantic Coastal Plain====\n\n{{main|South Carolina Lowcountry}}\n\nThe Atlantic Coastal Plain consists of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present. The terrain is relatively flat and the soil is composed predominantly of sand, silt, and clay. Areas with better drainage make excellent farmland, though some land is swampy. An unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of low-relief topographic depressions named [[Carolina bay]]s. The bays tend to be oval, lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation. The eastern portion of the coastal plain contains many [[salt marsh]]es and [[estuary|estuaries]], as well as natural ports such as [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the [[Middle Atlantic coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]].<ref name=\"ecoregions\">{{cite journal|author1=Olson, D. M |author2=E.

The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago. Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures and stronger winds.<ref>Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs, K.M., 2016, \"The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States\": Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286; www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research</ref>\n\n====Piedmont====\n\nMuch of Piedmont consists of Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks, and the landscape has relatively low relief. Due to the changing economics of farming, much of the land is now reforested in Loblolly pine for the lumber industry. These forests are part of the [[Southeastern mixed forests]] ecoregion.<ref name = \"ecoregions\"/> At the southeastern edge of Piedmont is the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], where rivers drop to the coastal plain. The fall line was an important early source of water power. Mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities, including the capital, [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line, providing a trade route for mill towns.\n\nThe northwestern part of Piedmont is also known as the Foothills. The [[South Carolina Highway 11|Cherokee Parkway]] is a scenic driving route through this area. This is where [[Table Rock State Park (South Carolina)|Table Rock State Park]] is located.\n\n====Blue Ridge====\n\nThe Blue Ridge consists primarily of Precambrian metamorphic rocks, and the landscape has relatively high relief. The Blue Ridge Region contains an [[escarpment]] of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] that continues into [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]].

In the summer, South Carolina is hot and humid, with daytime temperatures averaging between {{convert|86|-|93|F|C}} in most of the state and overnight lows averaging {{convert|70|-|75|F|C}} on the coast and from {{convert|66|-|73|F|C}} inland. Winter temperatures are much less uniform in South Carolina.\n\nCoastal areas of the state have very mild winters, with high temperatures approaching an average of {{convert|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and overnight lows around 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (5\u20138&nbsp;\u00b0C). Inland, the average January overnight low is around {{convert|32|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in Columbia and temperatures well below freezing in the Upstate. While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state, the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer, while inland, the spring and autumn transitions tend to be the wettest periods and winter the driest season, with November being the driest month. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|113|F|C}} in [[Johnston, South Carolina|Johnston]] and Columbia on June 29, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-19|F|C}} at [[Caesars Head]] on January 21, 1985.\n\nSnowfall in South Carolina is somewhat uncommon in most of the state, while coastal areas receive less than an inch (2.5&nbsp;cm) annually on average. It is not uncommon for the state (especially the southern coast) to receive no recordable snowfall in a given year. The interior receives a little more snow, although nowhere in the state averages more than {{convert|12|in|cm}} of snow annually. The mountains of extreme northwestern South Carolina tend to have the most substantial snow accumulation. Freezing rain and ice tend to be more common than snow in many areas of the state. Road bridges in South Carolina are commonly marked, \"Bridge ices before road\".\n\nSouth Carolina is also prone to [[tropical cyclone]]s and [[tornado]]es. Two of the strongest hurricanes to strike South Carolina in recent history were [[Hurricane Hazel]] (1954) and [[Hurricane Hugo]] (1989).\n{{South Carolina weatherbox}}\n\n====Hurricanes and tropical cyclones====\n\n[[File:Hurricane Hugo 1989 sept 21 1844Z.jpg|thumb|Category 4 Hurricane Hugo in 1989]]\n\nThe state is occasionally affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s. This is an annual concern during hurricane season, which lasts from June{{nbsp}}1 to November 30. The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October, during the [[Cape Verde hurricane]] season. Memorable [[hurricane]]s to hit South Carolina include [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] (1954), [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]] (2018), and [[Hurricane Hugo|Hugo]] (1989), all [[Category 4 hurricane]]s.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif NOAA National Climatic Data Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=October 16, 2011 }}.

This is less than some of the states further south, and it is slightly less vulnerable to [[tornado]]es than the states which border on the Gulf of Mexico. Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina, and the state averages around 14 tornadoes annually.

Also relevant are the state constitution, law enforcement agencies, federal representation, state finances, and state taxes.\n\nSouth Carolina has historically had a weak executive branch and a strong legislature. Before 1865, governors in South Carolina were appointed by the General Assembly, and held the title \"President of State\". The 1865 Constitution changed this process, requiring a popular election. Local governments were also weak. But, the 1867 Constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]], extended democratization by establishing [[home rule]] for counties, which were established from the formerly designated districts of the state.\n\nThe 1895 state constitution overturned this, reducing the role of counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature; essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the General Assembly through the legislative delegation for each county.<ref name=\"governance\"/> They are geographically comprehensive; all areas of the state are included in counties. As each county had one state senator, that position was particularly powerful. This status continued until 1973, when the state constitution was amended to provide for [[home rule]] for the counties. During this time the state had changed, with increasing urbanization, but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts.<ref name=\"Tyler 1998 p. 222\">Tyler (1998), \"The South Carolina Governance Project\", p. 222</ref>\n\nThe federal court case, ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), \"established the one-man, one-vote\nconcept for electoral representation at the state level. Legislators were now supposed to represent\nmore or less equal numbers of people.\"<ref name=\"Tyler 1998 p. 222\"/> Residents of urban areas had been found to be markedly underrepresented in the legislature under the county-based system. Reapportionment made obvious the need for other changes to county structure, leading to the legislature passing the constitutional amendment. The Home Rule Act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties. With urbanization, their governments have become increasingly important in the state.<ref name=\"Tyler 1998 p. 222\"/>\n\nSeveral changes to the state constitution have affected the office of the governor and the cabinet. In 1926 the governor's term was extended from two to four years; in 1982 the governor was allowed to run for a second succeeding term. In 1993, the state passed an amendment requiring a limited cabinet (all of whom must be popularly elected).\n\nAs of January 2, 2016, there were 2,948,772 registered voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scvotes.org/cgi-bin/scsec/96vr?countykey=ALL&D1=ALL |title=South Carolina Voter Registration Demographics |publisher=South Carolina State Election Commission |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302041436/http://www.scvotes.org/cgi-bin/scsec/96vr?countykey=ALL&D1=ALL |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scvotes.org/statistics/voter_registration |title=Voter Registration ('By County and Precinct') |publisher=South Carolina State Election Commission |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304171428/http://scvotes.org/statistics/voter_registration |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of South Carolina}}\n\n===Precolonial period===\n\nThere is evidence of human activity in the area about 40,000 years ago.

Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].

A Republican-Populist biracial coalition took power away from White Democrats temporarily. To prevent that from happening again, Democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 which effectively [[Disenfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency, and [[literacy test]]s that dramatically reduced the voter rolls.

During the constitutional convention in 1895, he supported another man's proposal that the state adopt a [[one-drop rule]], as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known African ancestry.\n\nSome members of the convention realized prominent white families with some African ancestry could be affected by such legislation. In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal (which was dropped), George Dionysius Tillman said in opposition:\n<blockquote>If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in [[Aiken County, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[Barnwell County, South Carolina|Barnwell]], [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton]], and [[Orangeburg County, South Carolina|Orangeburg]] will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of{{nbsp}}... colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.<ref>\"All Niggers, More or Less!\" ''The News and Courier'', Oct. 17 1895, 5</ref><ref>Joel Williamson, ''New People: Miscegenation and Mulattoes in the United States'' (New York, 1980) 93</ref><ref>Lerone Bennett Jr., ''Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America'', 6th rev. ed.

Locally, the coastal plain is referred to as the Low Country, and the other two regions as the Midlands and the Upstate respectively.<ref name=\"netstate\">{{cite web|title=The Geography of South Carolina|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/sc_geography.htm|accessdate=17 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307115338/http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/sc_geography.htm|archive-date=March 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Atlantic Coastal Plain makes up two-thirds of the state. Its eastern border is the [[Sea Islands]], a chain of tidal and [[barrier islands]]. The border between the low country and the up country is defined by the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]], which marks the limit of navigable rivers.\n\n====Atlantic Coastal Plain====\n\n{{main|South Carolina Lowcountry}}\n\nThe Atlantic Coastal Plain consists of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present. The terrain is relatively flat and the soil is composed predominantly of sand, silt, and clay. Areas with better drainage make excellent farmland, though some land is swampy. An unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of low-relief topographic depressions named [[Carolina bay]]s. The bays tend to be oval, lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation. The eastern portion of the coastal plain contains many [[salt marsh]]es and [[estuary|estuaries]], as well as natural ports such as [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the [[Middle Atlantic coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]].<ref name=\"ecoregions\">{{cite journal|author1=Olson, D. M |author2=E.

The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago. Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures and stronger winds.<ref>Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs, K.M., 2016, \"The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States\": Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286; www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research</ref>\n\n====Piedmont====\n\nMuch of Piedmont consists of Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks, and the landscape has relatively low relief. Due to the changing economics of farming, much of the land is now reforested in Loblolly pine for the lumber industry. These forests are part of the [[Southeastern mixed forests]] ecoregion.<ref name = \"ecoregions\"/> At the southeastern edge of Piedmont is the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], where rivers drop to the coastal plain. The fall line was an important early source of water power. Mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities, including the capital, [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line, providing a trade route for mill towns.\n\nThe northwestern part of Piedmont is also known as the Foothills. The [[South Carolina Highway 11|Cherokee Parkway]] is a scenic driving route through this area. This is where [[Table Rock State Park (South Carolina)|Table Rock State Park]] is located.\n\n====Blue Ridge====\n\nThe Blue Ridge consists primarily of Precambrian metamorphic rocks, and the landscape has relatively high relief. The Blue Ridge Region contains an [[escarpment]] of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] that continues into [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]]. [[Sassafras Mountain]], South Carolina's highest point at {{convert|3560|ft|m}}, is in this area.<ref name=\"usgs\">{{cite web|date=April 29, 2005 |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=U.S Geological Survey |accessdate=November 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116113632/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |archivedate=January 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Also in this area is [[Caesars Head State Park]].

South Carolina averages 10\u201315 earthquakes a year below magnitude{{nbsp}}3 (FEMA). The [[1886 Charleston earthquake|Charleston earthquake of 1886]] was the largest quake ever to hit the eastern United States. The 7.0\u20137.3 magnitude earthquake killed 60 people and destroyed much of the city.<ref>Abridged from ''Seismicity of the United States, 1568\u20131989 (Revised)'', by Carl W. Stover and Jerry L. Coffman, U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1527, United States Government Printing Office, Washington: 1993.</ref> Faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them. Many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries.\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{Main|Climate of South Carolina}}\n{{stack|float=left|\n[[File:SCprecipitation.gif|thumb|left|A map of the average annual [[precipitation]] in South Carolina]]\n[[File:Lake Wylie in autumn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lake Wylie]] in autumn]]\n}}\n\nSouth Carolina has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), although high-elevation areas in the Upstate area have fewer subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline. In the summer, South Carolina is hot and humid, with daytime temperatures averaging between {{convert|86|-|93|F|C}} in most of the state and overnight lows averaging {{convert|70|-|75|F|C}} on the coast and from {{convert|66|-|73|F|C}} inland. Winter temperatures are much less uniform in South Carolina.\n\nCoastal areas of the state have very mild winters, with high temperatures approaching an average of {{convert|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and overnight lows around 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (5\u20138&nbsp;\u00b0C). Inland, the average January overnight low is around {{convert|32|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in Columbia and temperatures well below freezing in the Upstate. While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state, the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer, while inland, the spring and autumn transitions tend to be the wettest periods and winter the driest season, with November being the driest month. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|113|F|C}} in [[Johnston, South Carolina|Johnston]] and Columbia on June 29, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-19|F|C}} at [[Caesars Head]] on January 21, 1985.\n\nSnowfall in South Carolina is somewhat uncommon in most of the state, while coastal areas receive less than an inch (2.5&nbsp;cm) annually on average. It is not uncommon for the state (especially the southern coast) to receive no recordable snowfall in a given year. The interior receives a little more snow, although nowhere in the state averages more than {{convert|12|in|cm}} of snow annually. The mountains of extreme northwestern South Carolina tend to have the most substantial snow accumulation. Freezing rain and ice tend to be more common than snow in many areas of the state. Road bridges in South Carolina are commonly marked, \"Bridge ices before road\".\n\nSouth Carolina is also prone to [[tropical cyclone]]s and [[tornado]]es. Two of the strongest hurricanes to strike South Carolina in recent history were [[Hurricane Hazel]] (1954) and [[Hurricane Hugo]] (1989).\n{{South Carolina weatherbox}}\n\n====Hurricanes and tropical cyclones====\n\n[[File:Hurricane Hugo 1989 sept 21 1844Z.jpg|thumb|Category 4 Hurricane Hugo in 1989]]\n\nThe state is occasionally affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s. This is an annual concern during hurricane season, which lasts from June{{nbsp}}1 to November 30. The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October, during the [[Cape Verde hurricane]] season. Memorable [[hurricane]]s to hit South Carolina include [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] (1954), [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]] (2018), and [[Hurricane Hugo|Hugo]] (1989), all [[Category 4 hurricane]]s.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif NOAA National Climatic Data Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=October 16, 2011 }}. Retrieved on October 24, 2006.</ref>\n\nSouth Carolina averages around 50 days of [[thunderstorm]] activity a year. This is less than some of the states further south, and it is slightly less vulnerable to [[tornado]]es than the states which border on the Gulf of Mexico. Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina, and the state averages around 14 tornadoes annually. [[Hail]] is common with many of the thunderstorms in the state, as there is often a marked contrast in temperature of warmer ground conditions compared to the cold air aloft.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\"/>\n\n===Federal lands in South Carolina===\n\n{{Main|List of federal lands in South Carolina}}\n[[File:Congaree swamp.jpg|right|thumb|[[Congaree National Park]], Hopkins]]\n\n* [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]] at [[Parris Island, South Carolina|Parris Island]]\n* [[Charles Pinckney National Historic Site]] at [[Mt.

Also relevant are the state constitution, law enforcement agencies, federal representation, state finances, and state taxes.\n\nSouth Carolina has historically had a weak executive branch and a strong legislature. Before 1865, governors in South Carolina were appointed by the General Assembly, and held the title \"President of State\". The 1865 Constitution changed this process, requiring a popular election. Local governments were also weak. But, the 1867 Constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]], extended democratization by establishing [[home rule]] for counties, which were established from the formerly designated districts of the state.\n\nThe 1895 state constitution overturned this, reducing the role of counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature; essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the General Assembly through the legislative delegation for each county.<ref name=\"governance\"/> They are geographically comprehensive; all areas of the state are included in counties. As each county had one state senator, that position was particularly powerful. This status continued until 1973, when the state constitution was amended to provide for [[home rule]] for the counties. During this time the state had changed, with increasing urbanization, but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts.<ref name=\"Tyler 1998 p. 222\">Tyler (1998), \"The South Carolina Governance Project\", p. 222</ref>\n\nThe federal court case, ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), \"established the one-man, one-vote\nconcept for electoral representation at the state level. Legislators were now supposed to represent\nmore or less equal numbers of people.\"<ref name=\"Tyler 1998 p. 222\"/> Residents of urban areas had been found to be markedly underrepresented in the legislature under the county-based system. Reapportionment made obvious the need for other changes to county structure, leading to the legislature passing the constitutional amendment. The Home Rule Act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties. With urbanization, their governments have become increasingly important in the state.<ref name=\"Tyler 1998 p. 222\"/>\n\nSeveral changes to the state constitution have affected the office of the governor and the cabinet. In 1926 the governor's term was extended from two to four years; in 1982 the governor was allowed to run for a second succeeding term. In 1993, the state passed an amendment requiring a limited cabinet (all of whom must be popularly elected).\n\nAs of January 2, 2016, there were 2,948,772 registered voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scvotes.org/cgi-bin/scsec/96vr?countykey=ALL&D1=ALL |title=South Carolina Voter Registration Demographics |publisher=South Carolina State Election Commission |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302041436/http://www.scvotes.org/cgi-bin/scsec/96vr?countykey=ALL&D1=ALL |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scvotes.org/statistics/voter_registration |title=Voter Registration ('By County and Precinct') |publisher=South Carolina State Election Commission |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304171428/http://scvotes.org/statistics/voter_registration |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of South Carolina}}\n\n===Precolonial period===\n\nThere is evidence of human activity in the area about 40,000 years ago.

It was the first European settlement in what is now [[Contiguous United States|mainland USA]]. Established with five hundred settlers, it was abandoned eight months later by one hundred and fifty survivors. In 1540, [[Hernando de Soto]] explored the region and the main town of [[Cofitachequi]], where he captured the queen of the [[Muscogee|Maskoki]] (Muscogee) and the [[Cherokee|Chelaque]] (Cherokee) who had welcomed him.\n[[File:Floride francaise Pierre du Val.jpg|thumb|Later map of [[French Florida]]]]\n\nIn 1562 French [[Huguenot]]s established a settlement at what is now the [[Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site|Charlesfort-Santa Elena]] archaeological site on [[Parris Island, South Carolina|Parris Island]]. Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. The garrison lacked supplies, however, and the soldiers (as in the [[France Antarctique]]) soon ran away.

In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal (which was dropped), George Dionysius Tillman said in opposition:\n<blockquote>If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in [[Aiken County, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[Barnwell County, South Carolina|Barnwell]], [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton]], and [[Orangeburg County, South Carolina|Orangeburg]] will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified.

The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins.
