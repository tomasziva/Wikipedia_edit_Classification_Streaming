J. Simpson]] about an infected Swedish terrorist who infects a train's passengers as they head to a derelict [[arch bridge]].\n\nWith the backing of the media tycoon [[Lew Grade|Sir Lew Grade]] (the head of the British broadcast network [[Associated Television]]) and the Italian film producer [[Carlo Ponti]], the international [[all-star]] cast was expected to attract a widespread audience, with rights sold prior to filming, to both British and American distributors.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> Ponti also saw the production as a showcase for his wife, Sophia Loren.<ref>Verlhac and Dherbier 2008, p. 12.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the existence of a strain of [[plague (disease)|plague]] (vaguely identified as [[pneumonic plague|pneumonic]]) is revealed at the US mission at the [[World Health Organization|International Health Organization]], three terrorists seek to blow up the US mission. Two of them are shot, one mortally, by security personnel but one escapes. The surviving terrorist is hospitalised and quarantined and identified as [[Sweden|Swedish]]. Elena Stradner and US military intelligence Colonel Stephen Mackenzie argue over the nature of the strain, which Stradner suspects is a biological weapon but which Colonel Mackenzie claims was in the process of being destroyed.\n\nThe third terrorist, Eklund, escapes and stows away on a train bound from [[Geneva]] to [[Stockholm]]. Stradner believes that the train should be stopped so that the terrorist can be removed and quarantined, but Col. Mackenzie is concerned that all of the passengers on the train might be infected. Mackenzie insists on rerouting the train to a disused railway line which goes to a former [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] in Janov, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] where the passengers will be quarantined. However, the line crosses a dangerously unsound [[arch bridge|steel arch bridge]] known as the Kasundruv Bridge or the \"Cassandra Crossing\", out of use since 1948 (former railway [[Zag\u00f3rz|Zagorz]]-[[Solina, Poland|Solina]]-[[Turka, Ukraine|Turka]]-[[Lviv]] between Poland and Ukraine)\n\nMackenzie understands that the bridge might collapse as the train passes over it.\nThe presence of the infected terrorist, and the rerouting of the train, precipitates the second conflict, among passengers on the train; they include Jonathan Chamberlain, a famous [[neurologist]], his ex-wife Jennifer Rispoli Chamberlain, a former inmate of Janov and [[Holocaust]] survivor Herman Kaplan, and Nicole Dressler, the wife of a German arms dealer. She is embroiled in an affair with her young companion Robby Navarro. Navarro is a heroin trafficker being pursued by [[Interpol]] agent Haley, who is travelling undercover as a priest.\n\nMackenzie informs Chamberlain of the presence of Eklund, who is found, but attempts to remove him via a helicopter are unsuccessful because the train enters a tunnel. Chamberlain is also told that the plague has a 60% mortality rate.  Mackenzie, however, informs passengers that police have received reports of anarchist bombs placed along the rail line, and that the train will be rerouted to [[Nuremberg]]. There the train is sealed with an enclosed oxygen system and a [[US Army]] medical team is placed aboard, with the now-deceased terrorist being placed in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically-sealed]] coffin. Chamberlain learns of the risk of the Cassandra Crossing. He also begins to suspect the disease is not as serious as originally thought: few of the passengers have become infected and few of those have actually died. He radios MacKenzie suggesting the infected portion of the train be uncoupled and isolated, but MacKenzie, acting under orders, has no intention of stopping the train: if, as expected, the Cassandra Crossing collapses, it will neatly cover the fact that the U.S has been harbouring [[germ warfare]] agents in a neutral country. Chamberlain and Haley form a group of passengers to overcome the guards and seize control of the train before it reaches the doomed bridge.  \n\nAfter Navarro is killed by the guards trying to reach the engine, and Haley and Kaplan sacrifice themselves, Chamberlain manages to separate the rear half of the train, hoping that with less weight the front half will cross safely. But the bridge collapses, killing everyone aboard the front half. Max, the train's conductor, applies the manual brakes and stops the remaining cars just before reaching the downed bridge. The survivors soon evacuate the remaining cars and head off on foot, no longer under guard or quarantine. In Geneva, both Stradner and MacKenzie depart: she keeps hope of survivors while he feels quiet guilt over the whole affair. After they leave, Major Stack informs MacKenzie's superior that both the colonel and the doctor are under surveillance.\n[[File:Garabit.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The [[Garabit Viaduct]] arch bridge was used to represent the condemned \"Cassandra Crossing\".]]\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Jennifer Rispoli Chamberlain\n* [[Richard Harris]] as Jonathan Chamberlain\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Col.
