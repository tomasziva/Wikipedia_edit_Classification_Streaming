{"title_page": "Fatigue (material)", "text_new": "{{short description|Weakening of a material caused by varying applied loads}}\n{{redirect|Metal fatigue||Metal Fatigue (disambiguation)}}\n{{Mechanical failure modes}}\n\nIn [[materials science]], '''fatigue''' is the weakening of a material caused by cyclic loading that results in progressive and localised structural damage and the growth of cracks. Once a '''fatigue crack''' has initiated, each loading cycle will grow the crack a small amount, typically producing [[striation (fatigue)|striations]] on some parts of the fracture surface. The crack will continue to grow until it reaches a critical size, which occurs when the [[stress intensity factor]] of the crack exceeds the [[fracture toughness]] of the material, producing rapid propagation and typically complete fracture of the structure.\n\nFatigue has traditionally been associated with the failure of metal components which led to the term '''metal fatigue'''. In the nineteenth century, the sudden failing of metal railway axles was thought to be caused by the metal ''crystallising'' because of the brittle appearance of the fracture surface, but this has since been disproved.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schijve |first=J. |title=Fatigue of structures and materials in the 20th century and the state of the art |journal=International Journal of Fatigue |year=2003 |volume=25 |pages=679\u2013702 |number=8|doi=10.1016/S0142-1123(03)00051-3 |url=http://www.gruppofrattura.it/ocs/index.php/esis/ECF14/paper/view/7980}}</ref> Most materials seem to experience some sort of fatigue-related failure such as composites, plastics and ceramics.<ref name=\"suresh04\">{{cite book |last1=Suresh |first1=S. |authorlink=Subra Suresh |year=2004 |title=Fatigue of Materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57046-6}}</ref>\n\nTo aid in predicting the fatigue life of a component, [[fatigue testing|fatigue tests]] are carried out using coupons to measure the rate of crack growth by applying constant amplitude cyclic loading and averaging the measured growth of a crack over thousands of cycles. However, there are also a number of special cases that need to be considered where the rate of crack growth obtained from these tests needs adjustment. Such as: the reduced rate of growth that occurs for small loads near the ''threshold'' or after the application of an ''overload''; and the increased rate of crack growth associated with ''short cracks'' or after the application of an ''underload''.<ref name=\"suresh04\"/>\n\nIf the loads are above a certain threshold, microscopic cracks will begin to ''initiate'' at [[stress concentrations]] such as holes, ''persistent slip bands'' (PSBs), [[composite material|composite]] interfaces or [[grain boundaries]] in metals.<ref name=\"Laird\">{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=W.

Experiments have shown that low cycle fatigue is also crack growth.<ref name=\"murakami05\">{{cite journal |first1=Y. |last1=Murakami |first2=K. J. |last2=Miller |title=What is fatigue damage?

To begin the process cracks must nucleate within a material. This process can occur either at [[Stress concentration|stress risers]] in metallic samples or at areas with a high void density in polymer samples. These cracks propagate slowly at first during ''stage I'' crack growth along crystallographic planes, where [[shear stress]]es are highest. Once the cracks reach a critical size they propagate quickly during ''stage II'' crack growth in a direction perpendicular to the applied force. These cracks can eventually lead to the ultimate failure of the material, often in a brittle catastrophic fashion.\n\n===Crack initiation===\nThe formation of initial cracks preceding fatigue failure is a separate process consisting of four discrete steps in metallic samples. The material will develop cell structures and harden in response to the applied load. This causes the amplitude of the applied stress to increase given the new restraints on strain. These newly formed cell structures will eventually break down with the formation of persistent slip bands (PSBs). Slip in the material is localized at these PSBs, and the exaggerated slip can now serve as a stress concentrator for a crack to form. Nucleation and growth of a crack to a detectable size accounts for most of the cracking process. It is for this reason that cyclic fatigue failures seem to occur so suddenly where the bulk of the changes in the material are not visible without destructive testing. Even in normally ductile materials, fatigue failures will resemble sudden brittle failures.\n\nPSB-induced slip planes result in intrusions and extrusions along the surface of a material, often occurring in pairs.<ref name=\"forsythe\">{{cite journal |year=1953 |last=Forsythe |first=P.

Instead of a smooth interface, the intrusions and extrusions will cause the surface of the material to resemble the edge of a deck of cards, where not all cards are perfectly aligned. Slip-induced intrusions and extrusions create extremely fine surface structures on the material. With surface structure size inversely related to stress concentration factors, PSB-induced surface slip can cause fractures to initiate.\n\nThese steps can also be bypassed entirely if the cracks form at a pre-existing stress concentrator such as from an inclusion in the material or from a geometric stress concentrator caused by a sharp internal corner or fillet.\n\n===Crack growth===\nMost of the fatigue life is generally consumed in the crack growth phase. The rate of growth is primarily driven by the range of cyclic loading although additional factors such as mean stress, environment, overloads and underloads can also affect the rate of growth. Crack growth may stop if the loads are small enough to fall below a critical threshold.\n\nFatigue cracks can grow from material or manufacturing defects from as small as 10 \u03bcm. \n\nWhen the rate of growth becomes large enough, fatigue striations can be seen on the fracture surface. Striations mark the position of the crack tip and the width of each striation represents the growth from one loading cycle. Striations are a result of plasticity at the crack tip.\n\nWhen the stress intensity exceeds a critical value known as the fracture toughness, unsustainable ''fast fracture'' will occur, usually by a process of [[microvoid coalescence]]. Prior to final fracture, the fracture surface may contain a mixture of areas of fatigue and fast fracture.\n\n==== Acceleration and retardation ====\nThe following effects change the rate of growth:<ref name=\"suresh04\"/>\n* '''Mean stress effect'''. Higher mean stress increases the rate of crack growth.\n* '''Environment'''. Increased moisture increases the rate of crack growth. In the case of aluminium, cracks generally grow from the surface, where water vapour from the atmosphere is able to reach the tip of the crack and dissociate into atomic hydrogen which causes [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. Cracks growing internally are isolated from the atmosphere and grow in a [[vacuum]] where the rate of growth is typically an order of magnitude slower than a surface crack.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schijve |first=J. |title=Internal fatigue cracks are growing in vacuum |journal=Engineering Fracture Mechanics |date=1978 |volume=10 |number=2 |pages=359\u2013370|doi=10.1016/0013-7944(78)90017-6 |url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:76092ee0-7a8f-48d1-b19c-d74be328a528}}</ref>\n* '''Short crack effect'''.

Small numbers of underloads increase the rate of growth and may counteract the effect of overloads.\n* '''Overloads'''. initially overloads (> 1.5 the maximum load in a sequence) lead to a small increase in the rate of growth followed by a long reduction in the rate of growth.\n\n==Characteristics of fatigue==\n[[File:Pedalarm Bruch.jpg|thumb|Fracture of an aluminium crank arm. Dark area of striations: slow crack growth. Bright granular area: sudden fracture.]]\n\n* In metal alloys, and for the simplifying case when there are no macroscopic or microscopic discontinuities, the process starts with dislocation movements at the microscopic level, which eventually form persistent slip bands that become the nucleus of short cracks.\n* Macroscopic and microscopic discontinuities (at the crystalline grain scale) as well as component design features which cause stress concentrations (holes, [[Key (engineering)|keyways]], sharp changes of load direction etc.) are common locations at which the fatigue process begins.\n* Fatigue is a process that has a degree of randomness ([[stochastic]]), often showing considerable scatter even in seemingly identical samples in well controlled environments.\n* Fatigue is usually associated with tensile stresses but fatigue cracks have been reported due to compressive loads.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fleck |first1=N.

Materials do not recover when rested.\n* Fatigue life is influenced by a variety of factors, such as [[temperature]], [[surface finish]], metallurgical microstructure, presence of [[oxidizing]] or [[Chemically inert|inert]] chemicals, [[residual stress]]es, scuffing contact ([[fretting]]), etc.\n* Some materials (e.g., some [[steel]] and [[titanium]] alloys) exhibit a theoretical [[fatigue limit]] below which continued loading does not lead to fatigue failure.\n* High cycle [[fatigue strength]] (about 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> cycles) can be described by stress-based parameters. A load-controlled servo-hydraulic test rig is commonly used in these tests, with frequencies of around 20&ndash;50&nbsp;Hz. Other sorts of machines&mdash;like resonant magnetic machines&mdash;can also be used, to achieve frequencies up to 250&nbsp;Hz.\n* [[Low-cycle fatigue]] (loading that typically causes failure in less than 10<sup>4</sup> cycles) is associated with localized plastic behavior in metals; thus, a strain-based parameter should be used for fatigue life prediction in metals. Testing is conducted with constant strain amplitudes typically at 0.01&ndash;5&nbsp;Hz.\n\n==Timeline of fatigue research history==\n[[File:Ewing and Humfrey fatigue cracks.JPG|thumb|right|Micrographs showing how surface fatigue cracks grow as material is further cycled.

In order to assess the safe life of such a part using the fatigue damage or stress/strain-life methods the following series of steps is usually performed:\n# Complex loading is reduced to a series of simple cyclic loadings using a technique such as [[rainflow-counting algorithm|rainflow analysis]];\n# A [[histogram]] of cyclic stress is created from the rainflow analysis to form a [[fatigue damage spectrum]];\n# For each stress level, the degree of cumulative damage is calculated from the S-N curve; and\n# The effect of the individual contributions are combined using an algorithm such as ''Miner's rule''.\n\nSince S-N curves are typically generated for ''uniaxial'' loading, some equivalence rule is needed whenever the loading is multiaxial. For simple, proportional loading histories (lateral load in a constant ratio with the axial), [[Sines rule]] may be applied. For more complex situations, such as non-proportional loading, [[critical plane analysis]] must be applied.\n\n==== Miner's rule ====\nIn 1945, M.A. Miner popularised a rule that had first been proposed by [[:sv:Arvid Palmgren|A. Palmgren]] in 1924.<ref name=\"miner\"/> The rule, variously called ''Miner's rule'' or the ''Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis'', states that where there are ''k'' different stress magnitudes in a spectrum, ''S<sub>i</sub>'' (1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''k''), each contributing ''n<sub>i</sub>''(''S<sub>i</sub>'') cycles, then if ''N<sub>i</sub>''(''S<sub>i</sub>'') is the number of cycles to failure of a constant stress reversal ''S<sub>i</sub>'' (determined by uni-axial fatigue tests), failure occurs when:\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac {n_i} {N_i}=C </math>\n\nUsually, for design purposes, C is assumed to be 1. This can be thought of as assessing what proportion of life is consumed by a linear combination of stress reversals at varying magnitudes.\n\nAlthough Miner's rule may be a useful approximation in many circumstances, it has several major limitations:\n#It fails to recognize the probabilistic nature of fatigue and there is no simple way to relate life predicted by the rule with the characteristics of a probability distribution. Industry analysts often use design curves, adjusted to account for scatter, to calculate ''N<sub>i</sub>''(''S<sub>i</sub>'').\n#The sequence in which high vs. low stress cycles are applied to a sample in fact affect the fatigue life, for which Miner's Rule does not account. In some circumstances, cycles of low stress followed by high stress cause more damage than would be predicted by the rule.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eskandari |first=H. |last2=Kim |first2=H.

With face-centered cubic metals (fcc), the W\u00f6hler curve generally drops continuously, so that only a ''fatigue limit'' can be assigned to these materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tec-science.com/material-science/material-testing/fatigue-test/|title=Fatigue test|last=tec-science|date=2018-07-13|website=tec-science|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Strain-life (\u03b5-N) method ====\n[[File:Strain-N.png|thumb|Graph showing fatigue failure as a function of strain amplitude.]]\n\nWhen strains are no longer elastic, such as in the presence of stress concentrations, the total strain can be used instead of stress as a similitude parameter. This is known as the strain-life method. The total strain amplitude <math> \\Delta \\varepsilon /2 </math> is the sum of the elastic strain amplitude <math>\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} / 2</math> and the plastic strain amplitude <math>\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{p} / 2</math> and is given by<ref name=\"suresh04\"/>\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon \\over 2} = {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} \\over 2} + {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{p} \\over 2} </math>.\n\nBasquin's equation for the elastic strain amplitude is\n::<math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} \\over 2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\sigma}{2E} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\text{a}}{E} </math>\nwhere <math>E</math> is [[Young's modulus]].\n\nThe relation for high cycle fatigue can be expressed using the elastic strain amplitude\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} \\over 2} = \\frac{\\sigma^\\prime_\\text{f}}{E} (2N_\\text{f})^b </math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma^\\prime_\\text{f}</math> is a parameter that scales with tensile strength obtained by fitting experimental data, <math>N_\\text{f}</math> is the number of cycles to failure and <math>b</math> is the slope of the log-log curve again determined by curve fitting.\n\nIn 1954, Coffin and Manson proposed that the fatigue life of a component was related to the plastic strain amplitude using:\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{p} \\over 2} = \\varepsilon^\\prime_\\text{f}(2N_\\text{f})^c </math>.\n\nThe equations can be combined to account for high cycle and low cycle fatigue giving\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon \\over 2} = \\frac{\\sigma^\\prime_\\text{f}}{E} (2N_\\text{f})^b + \\varepsilon^\\prime_\\text{f}(2N_\\text{f})^c </math>.\n\n=== Crack growth methods ===\nAn estimate of the fatigue life of a component can be made using a [[crack growth equations|crack growth equation]] by summing up the width of each increment of crack growth for each loading cycle.  Safety or scatter factors are applied to the calculated life to account for any uncertainty and variability associated with fatigue. The rate of growth used in crack growth predictions is typically measured by applying thousands of constant amplitude cycles to a coupon and measuring the rate of growth from the change in compliance of the coupon or by measuring the growth of the crack on the surface of the coupon. Standard methods for measuring the rate of growth have been developed by ASTM International.<ref name=\"e647\">{{cite techreport |author=ASTM Committee E08.06 |title=E647 Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fatigue Crack Growth Rates |institution=ASTM International |number=E647-13 |date=2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Crack growth equations]] such as the [[Paris' law|Paris\u2013Erdo\u011fan equation]] are used to predict the life of a component. They can be used to predict the growth of a crack from 10&nbsp;um to failure. For normal manufacturing finishes this may cover the most of the fatigue life of a component where growth can start from the first cycle.<ref name=\"murakami05\"/> The conditions at the crack tip of a component are usually related to the conditions of test coupon using a characterising parameter such as the stress intensity, [[J-integral]] or [[crack tip opening displacement]]. All these techniques aim to match the crack tip conditions on the component to that of test coupons which give the rate of crack growth.\n\nAdditional models may be necessary to include retardation and acceleration effects associated with overloads or underloads in the loading sequence. In addition, small crack growth data may be needed to match the increased rate of growth seen with small cracks.<ref>{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Pearson |title=Initiation of fatigue cracks in commercial aluminum alloys and the subsequent propagation of very short cracks |journal=Engineering Fracture Mechanics |year=1975 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=235\u2013247|doi=10.1016/0013-7944(75)90004-1}}</ref>\n\nTypically, a cycle counting technique such as [[rainflow-counting algorithm|rainflow-cycle counting]] is used to extract the cycles from a complex sequence.

This information can be used to schedule inspections on a structure to ensure safety whereas strain/life methods only give a life until failure.\n\n== Dealing with fatigue ==\n[[File:New Guide Available for Fractography of Ceramics and Glasses (5941062316).jpg|thumb|Fracture surface in a glass rod showing beach marks surrounding the initiation site.]]\n\n=== Design ===\nDependable design against fatigue-failure requires thorough education and supervised experience in [[structural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], or [[materials science]]. There are at least five principal approaches to life assurance for mechanical parts that display increasing degrees of sophistication:<ref>{{cite web |last=Udomphol |first=T. |year=2007 |title=Fatigue of metals |url=http://www.sut.ac.th/engineering/metal/pdf/MechMet/12_Fatigue%20of%20metals.pdf |page=54 |publisher=Suranaree University of Technology |access-date=2013-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102220804/http://www.sut.ac.th/engineering/metal/pdf/MechMet/12_Fatigue%20of%20metals.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-02 |url-status=dead |df=}}</ref>\n# Design to keep stress below threshold of [[fatigue limit]] (infinite lifetime concept);\n# [[Fail-safe]], [[graceful degradation]], and [[fault-tolerant design]]: Instruct the user to replace parts when they fail. Design in such a way that there is no [[single point of failure]], and so that when any one part completely fails, it does not lead to [[catastrophic failure]] of the entire system.\n#[[Safe-life design]]: Design (conservatively) for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the part with a new one (a so-called ''lifed'' part, finite lifetime concept, or \"safe-life\" design practice); [[planned obsolescence]] and [[disposable product]] are variants that design for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the entire device;\n# [[Damage tolerance]]: Is an approach that ensures aircraft safety by assuming the presence of cracks or defects even in new aircraft. Crack growth calculations, periodic inspections and component repair or replacement can be used to ensure critical components that may contain cracks, remain safe. Inspections usually use [[nondestructive testing]] to limit or monitor the size of possible cracks and require an [[accuracy|accurate]] prediction of the rate of crack-growth between inspections. The designer sets some [[aircraft maintenance checks]] schedule frequent enough that parts are replaced while the crack is still in the \"slow growth\" phase. This is often referred to as damage tolerant design or \"retirement-for-cause\".\n# [[Reliability Engineering|Risk Management]]: Ensures the probability of failure remains below an acceptable level. This approach is typically used for aircraft where acceptable levels may be based on probability of failure during a single flight or taken over the lifetime of an aircraft. A component is assumed to have a crack with a probability distribution of crack sizes. This approach can consider variability in values such as crack growth rates, usage and critical crack size.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. W. |last=Lincoln |title= Risk assessment of an aging military aircraft |journal=Journal of Aircraft |date=1985 |volume=22 |number=8 |pages=687\u2013691|doi=10.2514/3.45187}}</ref> It is also useful for considering damage at multiple locations that may interact to produce ''multi-site'' or [[widespread fatigue damage]]. Probability distributions that are common in data analysis and in design against fatigue include the [[log-normal distribution]], [[extreme value theory|extreme value distribution]], [[Birnbaum\u2013Saunders distribution]], and [[Weibull distribution]].\n\n=== Testing ===\n[[Fatigue testing]] can be used for components such as a coupon or a ''full-scale test article'' to determine:\n# the rate of crack growth and fatigue life of components such as a coupon or a full-scale test article.\n# location of critical regions\n# degree of [[fail-safe]]ty when part of the structure fails\n# the origin and cause of the crack initiating defect from [[Fractography|fractographic]] examination of the crack.\n\nThese tests may form part of the certification process such as for [[Airworthiness certificate|airworthiness certification]].\n\n=== Repair ===\n# '''Stop drill'''<!-- This section is linked from [[Manahawkin Bay Bridge]] --> Fatigue cracks that have begun to propagate can sometimes be stopped by [[drilling]] holes, called ''drill stops'', at the tip of the crack.<ref name=\"Material Technologies\">{{cite press |date=17 April 2007 |title=Material Technologies, Inc.

Changes in the materials used in parts can also improve fatigue life. For example, parts can be made from better fatigue rated metals. Complete replacement and redesign of parts can also reduce if not eliminate fatigue problems. Thus [[helicopter rotor]] blades and [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s in metal are being replaced by [[Composite material|composite]] equivalents. They are not only lighter, but also much more resistant to fatigue. They are more expensive, but the extra cost is amply repaid by their greater integrity, since loss of a rotor blade usually leads to total loss of the aircraft. A similar argument has been made for replacement of metal fuselages, wings and tails of aircraft.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoffer |first=W. |date=June 1989 |title=Horrors in the Skies |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BeQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67&dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum#v=onepage&q&f=true |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=166 |issue=6 |pages=67\u201370, 115\u2013117}}</ref>\n# '''Induce residual stresses''' [[Peening]] a surface can reduce such tensile stresses and create compressive [[residual stress]], which prevents crack initiation.

The carriages behind piled into the wrecked engines and caught fire. At least 55 passengers were killed trapped in the carriages, including the explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]. This accident is known in France as the \"Catastrophe ferroviaire de Meudon\". The accident was witnessed by the British locomotive engineer [[Joseph Locke]] and widely reported in Britain. It was discussed extensively by engineers, who sought an explanation.\n\nThe derailment had been the result of a broken [[locomotive]] axle. [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine's]] investigation of broken axles in Britain highlighted the importance of stress concentration, and the mechanism of crack growth with repeated loading. His and other papers suggesting a crack growth mechanism through repeated stressing, however, were ignored, and fatigue failures occurred at an ever-increasing rate on the expanding railway system. Other spurious theories seemed to be more acceptable, such as the idea that the metal had somehow \"crystallized\". The notion was based on the crystalline appearance of the fast fracture region of the crack surface, but ignored the fact that the metal was already highly crystalline.\n\n===de Havilland Comet===\n{{Main|BOAC Flight 781|South African Airways Flight 201}}\n[[File:Comet 1 G-ALYP - wreckage recovered png.png|thumb|right|The recovered (shaded) parts of the wreckage of ''G-ALYP'' and the site (arrowed) of the failure]]\n\nTwo [[de Havilland Comet]] passenger jets broke up in mid-air and crashed within a few months of each other in 1954. As a result, systematic tests were conducted on a [[fuselage]] immersed and pressurised in a water tank. After the equivalent of 3,000 flights, investigators at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) were able to conclude that the crash had been due to failure of the pressure cabin at the forward [[Radio direction finder|Automatic Direction Finder]] window in the roof. This 'window' was in fact one of two apertures for the [[Antenna (radio)|aerials]] of an electronic navigation system in which opaque [[fibreglass]] panels took the place of the window 'glass'. The failure was a result of metal fatigue caused by the repeated pressurisation and de-pressurisation of the aircraft cabin. Also, the supports around the windows were riveted, not bonded, as the original specifications for the aircraft had called for. The problem was exacerbated by the punch rivet construction technique employed. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting caused manufacturing defect cracks which may have caused the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet.\n\n[[File:Fuselage of de Havilland Comet Airliner G-ALYP.JPG|thumb|left|The fuselage roof fragment of ''G-ALYP'' on display in the Science Museum in London, showing the two ADF windows at which the initial failure occurred.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 September 2009 |title=ObjectWiki: Fuselage of de Havilland Comet Airliner G-ALYP |url=http://objectwiki.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wiki/Fuselage_of_de_Havilland_Comet_Airliner_G-ALYP |publisher=Science Museum |access-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107042926/http://objectwiki.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wiki/Fuselage_of_de_Havilland_Comet_Airliner_G-ALYP |archive-date=7 January 2009}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Comet's pressure cabin had been designed to a [[safety factor]] comfortably in excess of that required by British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (2.5 times the cabin [[proof test]] pressure as opposed to the requirement of 1.33 times and an ultimate load of 2.0 times the cabin pressure) and the accident caused a revision in the estimates of the safe loading strength requirements of airliner pressure cabins.\n\nIn addition, it was discovered that the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] around pressure cabin apertures were considerably higher than had been anticipated, especially around sharp-cornered cut-outs, such as windows. As a result, all future [[jet airliner]]s would feature windows with rounded corners, greatly reducing the stress concentration. This was a noticeable distinguishing feature of all later models of the Comet. Investigators from the RAE told a public inquiry that the [[stress concentration|sharp corners]] near the Comets' window openings acted as initiation sites for cracks. The skin of the aircraft was also too thin, and cracks from manufacturing stresses were present at the corners.\n\n===Alexander L. Kielland oil platform capsizing===\n[[File:ALK columns fractures english.png|thumb|Fractures on the right side of the Alexander L. Kielland rig]]\n\nThe [[Alexander L. Kielland (platform)|''Alexander L. Kielland'']] was a Norwegian [[semi-submersible]] [[drilling rig]] that capsized whilst working in the [[Ekofisk oil field]] in March 1980, killing 123 people. The capsizing was the worst disaster in Norwegian waters since World War II. The rig, located approximately 320&nbsp;km east of [[Dundee]], Scotland, was owned by the Stavanger Drilling Company of Norway and was on hire to the United States company [[Phillips Petroleum]] at the time of the disaster. In driving rain and mist, early in the evening of 27 March 1980 more than 200 men were off duty in the accommodation on the ''Alexander L. Kielland''. The wind was gusting to 40 knots with waves up to 12 m high. The rig had just been winched away from the ''Edda'' production platform. Minutes before 18:30 those on board felt a 'sharp crack' followed by 'some kind of trembling'. Suddenly the rig heeled over 30\u00b0 and then stabilised. Five of the six anchor cables had broken, with one remaining cable preventing the rig from capsizing. The [[Angle of list|list]] continued to increase and at 18:53 the remaining anchor cable snapped and the rig turned upside down.\n\nA year later in March 1981, the investigative report<ref>{{cite book |title=The Alexander L. Kielland accident, Report of a Norwegian public commission appointed by royal decree of March 28, 1980, presented to the Ministry of Justice and Police March |year=1981 |series=Norwegian Public Reports 1981:11 |publisher=Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security |asin=B0000ED27N}}</ref> concluded that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack in one of its six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg to the rest of the rig. This was traced to a small 6&nbsp;mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of [[lamellar tearing]] in the flange plate and cold cracks in the butt weld.

Once a '''fatigue crack''' has initiated, each loading cycle will grow the crack a small amount, typically producing [[striation (fatigue)|striations]] on some parts of the fracture surface. The crack will continue to grow until it reaches a critical size, which occurs when the [[stress intensity factor]] of the crack exceeds the [[fracture toughness]] of the material, producing rapid propagation and typically complete fracture of the structure.\n\nFatigue has traditionally been associated with the failure of metal components which led to the term '''metal fatigue'''. In the nineteenth century, the sudden failing of metal railway axles was thought to be caused by the metal ''crystallising'' because of the brittle appearance of the fracture surface, but this has since been disproved.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schijve |first=J. |title=Fatigue of structures and materials in the 20th century and the state of the art |journal=International Journal of Fatigue |year=2003 |volume=25 |pages=679\u2013702 |number=8|doi=10.1016/S0142-1123(03)00051-3 |url=http://www.gruppofrattura.it/ocs/index.php/esis/ECF14/paper/view/7980}}</ref> Most materials seem to experience some sort of fatigue-related failure such as composites, plastics and ceramics.<ref name=\"suresh04\">{{cite book |last1=Suresh |first1=S. |authorlink=Subra Suresh |year=2004 |title=Fatigue of Materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57046-6}}</ref>\n\nTo aid in predicting the fatigue life of a component, [[fatigue testing|fatigue tests]] are carried out using coupons to measure the rate of crack growth by applying constant amplitude cyclic loading and averaging the measured growth of a crack over thousands of cycles. However, there are also a number of special cases that need to be considered where the rate of crack growth obtained from these tests needs adjustment. Such as: the reduced rate of growth that occurs for small loads near the ''threshold'' or after the application of an ''overload''; and the increased rate of crack growth associated with ''short cracks'' or after the application of an ''underload''.<ref name=\"suresh04\"/>\n\nIf the loads are above a certain threshold, microscopic cracks will begin to ''initiate'' at [[stress concentrations]] such as holes, ''persistent slip bands'' (PSBs), [[composite material|composite]] interfaces or [[grain boundaries]] in metals.<ref name=\"Laird\">{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=W.

Experiments have shown that low cycle fatigue is also crack growth.<ref name=\"murakami05\">{{cite journal |first1=Y. |last1=Murakami |first2=K. J. |last2=Miller |title=What is fatigue damage?

To begin the process cracks must nucleate within a material. This process can occur either at [[Stress concentration|stress risers]] in metallic samples or at areas with a high void density in polymer samples. These cracks propagate slowly at first during ''stage I'' crack growth along crystallographic planes, where [[shear stress]]es are highest. Once the cracks reach a critical size they propagate quickly during ''stage II'' crack growth in a direction perpendicular to the applied force. These cracks can eventually lead to the ultimate failure of the material, often in a brittle catastrophic fashion.\n\n===Crack initiation===\nThe formation of initial cracks preceding fatigue failure is a separate process consisting of four discrete steps in metallic samples. The material will develop cell structures and harden in response to the applied load. This causes the amplitude of the applied stress to increase given the new restraints on strain. These newly formed cell structures will eventually break down with the formation of persistent slip bands (PSBs). Slip in the material is localized at these PSBs, and the exaggerated slip can now serve as a stress concentrator for a crack to form. Nucleation and growth of a crack to a detectable size accounts for most of the cracking process. It is for this reason that cyclic fatigue failures seem to occur so suddenly where the bulk of the changes in the material are not visible without destructive testing. Even in normally ductile materials, fatigue failures will resemble sudden brittle failures.\n\nPSB-induced slip planes result in intrusions and extrusions along the surface of a material, often occurring in pairs.<ref name=\"forsythe\">{{cite journal |year=1953 |last=Forsythe |first=P. J. E. |title=Exudation of material from slip bands at the surface of fatigued crystals of an aluminium-copper alloy |volume=171 |issue=4343 |periodical=Nature |pages=172\u2013173|bibcode=1953Natur.171..172F |doi=10.1038/171172a0 }}</ref> This slip is not a [[Microstructure|microstructural]] change within the material, but rather a propagation of [[dislocations]] within the material. Instead of a smooth interface, the intrusions and extrusions will cause the surface of the material to resemble the edge of a deck of cards, where not all cards are perfectly aligned. Slip-induced intrusions and extrusions create extremely fine surface structures on the material. With surface structure size inversely related to stress concentration factors, PSB-induced surface slip can cause fractures to initiate.\n\nThese steps can also be bypassed entirely if the cracks form at a pre-existing stress concentrator such as from an inclusion in the material or from a geometric stress concentrator caused by a sharp internal corner or fillet.\n\n===Crack growth===\nMost of the fatigue life is generally consumed in the crack growth phase. The rate of growth is primarily driven by the range of cyclic loading although additional factors such as mean stress, environment, overloads and underloads can also affect the rate of growth. Crack growth may stop if the loads are small enough to fall below a critical threshold.\n\nFatigue cracks can grow from material or manufacturing defects from as small as 10 \u03bcm. \n\nWhen the rate of growth becomes large enough, fatigue striations can be seen on the fracture surface. Striations mark the position of the crack tip and the width of each striation represents the growth from one loading cycle. Striations are a result of plasticity at the crack tip.\n\nWhen the stress intensity exceeds a critical value known as the fracture toughness, unsustainable ''fast fracture'' will occur, usually by a process of [[microvoid coalescence]]. Prior to final fracture, the fracture surface may contain a mixture of areas of fatigue and fast fracture.\n\n==== Acceleration and retardation ====\nThe following effects change the rate of growth:<ref name=\"suresh04\"/>\n* '''Mean stress effect'''. Higher mean stress increases the rate of crack growth.\n* '''Environment'''. Increased moisture increases the rate of crack growth. In the case of aluminium, cracks generally grow from the surface, where water vapour from the atmosphere is able to reach the tip of the crack and dissociate into atomic hydrogen which causes [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. Cracks growing internally are isolated from the atmosphere and grow in a [[vacuum]] where the rate of growth is typically an order of magnitude slower than a surface crack.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schijve |first=J. |title=Internal fatigue cracks are growing in vacuum |journal=Engineering Fracture Mechanics |date=1978 |volume=10 |number=2 |pages=359\u2013370|doi=10.1016/0013-7944(78)90017-6 |url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:76092ee0-7a8f-48d1-b19c-d74be328a528}}</ref>\n* '''Short crack effect'''.

Small numbers of underloads increase the rate of growth and may counteract the effect of overloads.\n* '''Overloads'''. initially overloads (> 1.5 the maximum load in a sequence) lead to a small increase in the rate of growth followed by a long reduction in the rate of growth.\n\n==Characteristics of fatigue==\n[[File:Pedalarm Bruch.jpg|thumb|Fracture of an aluminium crank arm. Dark area of striations: slow crack growth. Bright granular area: sudden fracture.]]\n\n* In metal alloys, and for the simplifying case when there are no macroscopic or microscopic discontinuities, the process starts with dislocation movements at the microscopic level, which eventually form persistent slip bands that become the nucleus of short cracks.\n* Macroscopic and microscopic discontinuities (at the crystalline grain scale) as well as component design features which cause stress concentrations (holes, [[Key (engineering)|keyways]], sharp changes of load direction etc.) are common locations at which the fatigue process begins.\n* Fatigue is a process that has a degree of randomness ([[stochastic]]), often showing considerable scatter even in seemingly identical samples in well controlled environments.\n* Fatigue is usually associated with tensile stresses but fatigue cracks have been reported due to compressive loads.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fleck |first1=N.

Materials do not recover when rested.\n* Fatigue life is influenced by a variety of factors, such as [[temperature]], [[surface finish]], metallurgical microstructure, presence of [[oxidizing]] or [[Chemically inert|inert]] chemicals, [[residual stress]]es, scuffing contact ([[fretting]]), etc.\n* Some materials (e.g., some [[steel]] and [[titanium]] alloys) exhibit a theoretical [[fatigue limit]] below which continued loading does not lead to fatigue failure.\n* High cycle [[fatigue strength]] (about 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> cycles) can be described by stress-based parameters. A load-controlled servo-hydraulic test rig is commonly used in these tests, with frequencies of around 20&ndash;50&nbsp;Hz. Other sorts of machines&mdash;like resonant magnetic machines&mdash;can also be used, to achieve frequencies up to 250&nbsp;Hz.\n* [[Low-cycle fatigue]] (loading that typically causes failure in less than 10<sup>4</sup> cycles) is associated with localized plastic behavior in metals; thus, a strain-based parameter should be used for fatigue life prediction in metals.

In order to assess the safe life of such a part using the fatigue damage or stress/strain-life methods the following series of steps is usually performed:\n# Complex loading is reduced to a series of simple cyclic loadings using a technique such as [[rainflow-counting algorithm|rainflow analysis]];\n# A [[histogram]] of cyclic stress is created from the rainflow analysis to form a [[fatigue damage spectrum]];\n# For each stress level, the degree of cumulative damage is calculated from the S-N curve; and\n# The effect of the individual contributions are combined using an algorithm such as ''Miner's rule''.\n\nSince S-N curves are typically generated for ''uniaxial'' loading, some equivalence rule is needed whenever the loading is multiaxial. For simple, proportional loading histories (lateral load in a constant ratio with the axial), [[Sines rule]] may be applied. For more complex situations, such as non-proportional loading, [[critical plane analysis]] must be applied.\n\n==== Miner's rule ====\nIn 1945, M.A. Miner popularised a rule that had first been proposed by [[:sv:Arvid Palmgren|A. Palmgren]] in 1924.<ref name=\"miner\"/> The rule, variously called ''Miner's rule'' or the ''Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis'', states that where there are ''k'' different stress magnitudes in a spectrum, ''S<sub>i</sub>'' (1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''k''), each contributing ''n<sub>i</sub>''(''S<sub>i</sub>'') cycles, then if ''N<sub>i</sub>''(''S<sub>i</sub>'') is the number of cycles to failure of a constant stress reversal ''S<sub>i</sub>'' (determined by uni-axial fatigue tests), failure occurs when:\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac {n_i} {N_i}=C </math>\n\nUsually, for design purposes, C is assumed to be 1. This can be thought of as assessing what proportion of life is consumed by a linear combination of stress reversals at varying magnitudes.\n\nAlthough Miner's rule may be a useful approximation in many circumstances, it has several major limitations:\n#It fails to recognize the probabilistic nature of fatigue and there is no simple way to relate life predicted by the rule with the characteristics of a probability distribution. Industry analysts often use design curves, adjusted to account for scatter, to calculate ''N<sub>i</sub>''(''S<sub>i</sub>'').\n#The sequence in which high vs. low stress cycles are applied to a sample in fact affect the fatigue life, for which Miner's Rule does not account. In some circumstances, cycles of low stress followed by high stress cause more damage than would be predicted by the rule.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eskandari |first=H. |last2=Kim |first2=H.

With face-centered cubic metals (fcc), the W\u00f6hler curve generally drops continuously, so that only a ''fatigue limit'' can be assigned to these materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tec-science.com/material-science/material-testing/fatigue-test/|title=Fatigue test|last=tec-science|date=2018-07-13|website=tec-science|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Strain-life (\u03b5-N) method ====\n[[File:Strain-N.png|thumb|Graph showing fatigue failure as a function of strain amplitude.]]\n\nWhen strains are no longer elastic, such as in the presence of stress concentrations, the total strain can be used instead of stress as a similitude parameter. This is known as the strain-life method. The total strain amplitude <math> \\Delta \\varepsilon /2 </math> is the sum of the elastic strain amplitude <math>\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} / 2</math> and the plastic strain amplitude <math>\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{p} / 2</math> and is given by<ref name=\"suresh04\"/>\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon \\over 2} = {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} \\over 2} + {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{p} \\over 2} </math>.\n\nBasquin's equation for the elastic strain amplitude is\n::<math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} \\over 2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\sigma}{2E} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\text{a}}{E} </math>\nwhere <math>E</math> is [[Young's modulus]].\n\nThe relation for high cycle fatigue can be expressed using the elastic strain amplitude\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{e} \\over 2} = \\frac{\\sigma^\\prime_\\text{f}}{E} (2N_\\text{f})^b </math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma^\\prime_\\text{f}</math> is a parameter that scales with tensile strength obtained by fitting experimental data, <math>N_\\text{f}</math> is the number of cycles to failure and <math>b</math> is the slope of the log-log curve again determined by curve fitting.\n\nIn 1954, Coffin and Manson proposed that the fatigue life of a component was related to the plastic strain amplitude using:\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon_\\text{p} \\over 2} = \\varepsilon^\\prime_\\text{f}(2N_\\text{f})^c </math>.\n\nThe equations can be combined to account for high cycle and low cycle fatigue giving\n:: <math> {\\Delta \\varepsilon \\over 2} = \\frac{\\sigma^\\prime_\\text{f}}{E} (2N_\\text{f})^b + \\varepsilon^\\prime_\\text{f}(2N_\\text{f})^c </math>.\n\n=== Crack growth methods ===\nAn estimate of the fatigue life of a component can be made using a [[crack growth equations|crack growth equation]] by summing up the width of each increment of crack growth for each loading cycle.  Safety or scatter factors are applied to the calculated life to account for any uncertainty and variability associated with fatigue. The rate of growth used in crack growth predictions is typically measured by applying thousands of constant amplitude cycles to a coupon and measuring the rate of growth from the change in compliance of the coupon or by measuring the growth of the crack on the surface of the coupon. Standard methods for measuring the rate of growth have been developed by ASTM International.<ref name=\"e647\">{{cite techreport |author=ASTM Committee E08.06 |title=E647 Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fatigue Crack Growth Rates |institution=ASTM International |number=E647-13 |date=2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Crack growth equations]] such as the [[Paris' law|Paris\u2013Erdo\u011fan equation]] are used to predict the life of a component. They can be used to predict the growth of a crack from 10&nbsp;um to failure. For normal manufacturing finishes this may cover the most of the fatigue life of a component where growth can start from the first cycle.<ref name=\"murakami05\"/> The conditions at the crack tip of a component are usually related to the conditions of test coupon using a characterising parameter such as the stress intensity, [[J-integral]] or [[crack tip opening displacement]]. All these techniques aim to match the crack tip conditions on the component to that of test coupons which give the rate of crack growth.\n\nAdditional models may be necessary to include retardation and acceleration effects associated with overloads or underloads in the loading sequence. In addition, small crack growth data may be needed to match the increased rate of growth seen with small cracks.<ref>{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Pearson |title=Initiation of fatigue cracks in commercial aluminum alloys and the subsequent propagation of very short cracks |journal=Engineering Fracture Mechanics |year=1975 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=235\u2013247|doi=10.1016/0013-7944(75)90004-1}}</ref>\n\nTypically, a cycle counting technique such as [[rainflow-counting algorithm|rainflow-cycle counting]] is used to extract the cycles from a complex sequence.

This information can be used to schedule inspections on a structure to ensure safety whereas strain/life methods only give a life until failure.\n\n== Dealing with fatigue ==\n[[File:New Guide Available for Fractography of Ceramics and Glasses (5941062316).jpg|thumb|Fracture surface in a glass rod showing beach marks surrounding the initiation site.]]\n\n=== Design ===\nDependable design against fatigue-failure requires thorough education and supervised experience in [[structural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], or [[materials science]]. There are at least five principal approaches to life assurance for mechanical parts that display increasing degrees of sophistication:<ref>{{cite web |last=Udomphol |first=T. |year=2007 |title=Fatigue of metals |url=http://www.sut.ac.th/engineering/metal/pdf/MechMet/12_Fatigue%20of%20metals.pdf |page=54 |publisher=Suranaree University of Technology |access-date=2013-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102220804/http://www.sut.ac.th/engineering/metal/pdf/MechMet/12_Fatigue%20of%20metals.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-02 |url-status=dead |df=}}</ref>\n# Design to keep stress below threshold of [[fatigue limit]] (infinite lifetime concept);\n# [[Fail-safe]], [[graceful degradation]], and [[fault-tolerant design]]: Instruct the user to replace parts when they fail. Design in such a way that there is no [[single point of failure]], and so that when any one part completely fails, it does not lead to [[catastrophic failure]] of the entire system.\n#[[Safe-life design]]: Design (conservatively) for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the part with a new one (a so-called ''lifed'' part, finite lifetime concept, or \"safe-life\" design practice); [[planned obsolescence]] and [[disposable product]] are variants that design for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the entire device;\n# [[Damage tolerance]]: Is an approach that ensures aircraft safety by assuming the presence of cracks or defects even in new aircraft. Crack growth calculations, periodic inspections and component repair or replacement can be used to ensure critical components that may contain cracks, remain safe. Inspections usually use [[nondestructive testing]] to limit or monitor the size of possible cracks and require an [[accuracy|accurate]] prediction of the rate of crack-growth between inspections. The designer sets some [[aircraft maintenance checks]] schedule frequent enough that parts are replaced while the crack is still in the \"slow growth\" phase. This is often referred to as damage tolerant design or \"retirement-for-cause\".\n# [[Reliability Engineering|Risk Management]]: Ensures the probability of failure remains below an acceptable level. This approach is typically used for aircraft where acceptable levels may be based on probability of failure during a single flight or taken over the lifetime of an aircraft. A component is assumed to have a crack with a probability distribution of crack sizes. This approach can consider variability in values such as crack growth rates, usage and critical crack size.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. W. |last=Lincoln |title= Risk assessment of an aging military aircraft |journal=Journal of Aircraft |date=1985 |volume=22 |number=8 |pages=687\u2013691|doi=10.2514/3.45187}}</ref> It is also useful for considering damage at multiple locations that may interact to produce ''multi-site'' or [[widespread fatigue damage]]. Probability distributions that are common in data analysis and in design against fatigue include the [[log-normal distribution]], [[extreme value theory|extreme value distribution]], [[Birnbaum\u2013Saunders distribution]], and [[Weibull distribution]].\n\n=== Testing ===\n[[Fatigue testing]] can be used for components such as a coupon or a ''full-scale test article'' to determine:\n# the rate of crack growth and fatigue life of components such as a coupon or a full-scale test article.\n# location of critical regions\n# degree of [[fail-safe]]ty when part of the structure fails\n# the origin and cause of the crack initiating defect from [[Fractography|fractographic]] examination of the crack.\n\nThese tests may form part of the certification process such as for [[Airworthiness certificate|airworthiness certification]].\n\n=== Repair ===\n# '''Stop drill'''<!-- This section is linked from [[Manahawkin Bay Bridge]] --> Fatigue cracks that have begun to propagate can sometimes be stopped by [[drilling]] holes, called ''drill stops'', at the tip of the crack.<ref name=\"Material Technologies\">{{cite press |date=17 April 2007 |title=Material Technologies, Inc.

Changes in the materials used in parts can also improve fatigue life. For example, parts can be made from better fatigue rated metals. Complete replacement and redesign of parts can also reduce if not eliminate fatigue problems. Thus [[helicopter rotor]] blades and [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s in metal are being replaced by [[Composite material|composite]] equivalents. They are not only lighter, but also much more resistant to fatigue. They are more expensive, but the extra cost is amply repaid by their greater integrity, since loss of a rotor blade usually leads to total loss of the aircraft. A similar argument has been made for replacement of metal fuselages, wings and tails of aircraft.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoffer |first=W. |date=June 1989 |title=Horrors in the Skies |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BeQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67&dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum#v=onepage&q&f=true |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=166 |issue=6 |pages=67\u201370, 115\u2013117}}</ref>\n# '''Induce residual stresses''' [[Peening]] a surface can reduce such tensile stresses and create compressive [[residual stress]], which prevents crack initiation.

The carriages behind piled into the wrecked engines and caught fire. At least 55 passengers were killed trapped in the carriages, including the explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]. This accident is known in France as the \"Catastrophe ferroviaire de Meudon\". The accident was witnessed by the British locomotive engineer [[Joseph Locke]] and widely reported in Britain. It was discussed extensively by engineers, who sought an explanation.\n\nThe derailment had been the result of a broken [[locomotive]] axle. [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine's]] investigation of broken axles in Britain highlighted the importance of stress concentration, and the mechanism of crack growth with repeated loading. His and other papers suggesting a crack growth mechanism through repeated stressing, however, were ignored, and fatigue failures occurred at an ever-increasing rate on the expanding railway system. Other spurious theories seemed to be more acceptable, such as the idea that the metal had somehow \"crystallized\". The notion was based on the crystalline appearance of the fast fracture region of the crack surface, but ignored the fact that the metal was already highly crystalline.\n\n===de Havilland Comet===\n{{Main|BOAC Flight 781|South African Airways Flight 201}}\n[[File:Comet 1 G-ALYP - wreckage recovered png.png|thumb|right|The recovered (shaded) parts of the wreckage of ''G-ALYP'' and the site (arrowed) of the failure]]\n\nTwo [[de Havilland Comet]] passenger jets broke up in mid-air and crashed within a few months of each other in 1954. As a result, systematic tests were conducted on a [[fuselage]] immersed and pressurised in a water tank. After the equivalent of 3,000 flights, investigators at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) were able to conclude that the crash had been due to failure of the pressure cabin at the forward [[Radio direction finder|Automatic Direction Finder]] window in the roof. This 'window' was in fact one of two apertures for the [[Antenna (radio)|aerials]] of an electronic navigation system in which opaque [[fibreglass]] panels took the place of the window 'glass'. The failure was a result of metal fatigue caused by the repeated pressurisation and de-pressurisation of the aircraft cabin. Also, the supports around the windows were riveted, not bonded, as the original specifications for the aircraft had called for. The problem was exacerbated by the punch rivet construction technique employed. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting caused manufacturing defect cracks which may have caused the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet.\n\n[[File:Fuselage of de Havilland Comet Airliner G-ALYP.JPG|thumb|left|The fuselage roof fragment of ''G-ALYP'' on display in the Science Museum in London, showing the two ADF windows at-which the initial failure occurred.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 September 2009 |title=ObjectWiki: Fuselage of de Havilland Comet Airliner G-ALYP |url=http://objectwiki.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wiki/Fuselage_of_de_Havilland_Comet_Airliner_G-ALYP |publisher=Science Museum |access-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107042926/http://objectwiki.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wiki/Fuselage_of_de_Havilland_Comet_Airliner_G-ALYP |archive-date=7 January 2009}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Comet's pressure cabin had been designed to a [[safety factor]] comfortably in excess of that required by British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (2.5 times the cabin [[proof test]] pressure as opposed to the requirement of 1.33 times and an ultimate load of 2.0 times the cabin pressure) and the accident caused a revision in the estimates of the safe loading strength requirements of airliner pressure cabins.\n\nIn addition, it was discovered that the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] around pressure cabin apertures were considerably higher than had been anticipated, especially around sharp-cornered cut-outs, such as windows. As a result, all future [[jet airliner]]s would feature windows with rounded corners, greatly reducing the stress concentration. This was a noticeable distinguishing feature of all later models of the Comet. Investigators from the RAE told a public inquiry that the [[stress concentration|sharp corners]] near the Comets' window openings acted as initiation sites for cracks. The skin of the aircraft was also too thin, and cracks from manufacturing stresses were present at the corners.\n\n===Alexander L. Kielland oil platform capsizing===\n[[File:ALK columns fractures english.png|thumb|Fractures on the right side of the Alexander L. Kielland rig]]\n\nThe [[Alexander L. Kielland (platform)|''Alexander L. Kielland'']] was a Norwegian [[semi-submersible]] [[drilling rig]] that capsized whilst working in the [[Ekofisk oil field]] in March 1980, killing 123 people. The capsizing was the worst disaster in Norwegian waters since World War II. The rig, located approximately 320&nbsp;km east of [[Dundee]], Scotland, was owned by the Stavanger Drilling Company of Norway and was on hire to the United States company [[Phillips Petroleum]] at the time of the disaster. In driving rain and mist, early in the evening of 27 March 1980 more than 200 men were off duty in the accommodation on the ''Alexander L. Kielland''. The wind was gusting to 40 knots with waves up to 12 m high. The rig had just been winched away from the ''Edda'' production platform. Minutes before 18:30 those on board felt a 'sharp crack' followed by 'some kind of trembling'. Suddenly the rig heeled over 30\u00b0 and then stabilised. Five of the six anchor cables had broken, with one remaining cable preventing the rig from capsizing. The [[Angle of list|list]] continued to increase and at 18:53 the remaining anchor cable snapped and the rig turned upside down.\n\nA year later in March 1981, the investigative report<ref>{{cite book |title=The Alexander L. Kielland accident, Report of a Norwegian public commission appointed by royal decree of March 28, 1980, presented to the Ministry of Justice and Police March |year=1981 |series=Norwegian Public Reports 1981:11 |publisher=Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security |asin=B0000ED27N}}</ref> concluded that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack in one of its six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg to the rest of the rig. This was traced to a small 6&nbsp;mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of [[lamellar tearing]] in the flange plate and cold cracks in the butt weld. Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the [[North Sea]]), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.\n\n===Others===\n* The 1862 [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] was caused by the fracture of a steam engine beam and killed 220 people.\n* The 1919 Boston [[Great Molasses Flood]] has been attributed to a fatigue failure.\n* The 1948 [[Northwest Airlines Flight 421]] crash due to fatigue failure in a wing spar root\n* The [[1957 Cebu Douglas C-47 crash|1957 \"Mt.
