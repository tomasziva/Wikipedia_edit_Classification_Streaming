In 2007, following [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]] that good respiratory and hand hygiene might reduce the spread of [[influenza|flu]], the phrase appeared in a government campaign that publicised the directive \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" throughout the [[NHS]], on buses and trains and in libraries, shopping centres and police stations.\n\nIn 2009, the slogan received widespread attention when the government funded its use in a national media campaign in response to the [[2009 flu pandemic]] caused by [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|swine flu]]. In that year, funding was granted for research to study [[Behavior change (public health)|public behaviour]] and the effect of initiatives such as the campaigns using the slogan. One of the researchers stated that \"Until a vaccine is ready, the main tool we have to combat pandemic flu is people's behaviour. For example, good respiratory and hand hygiene, as summed up in the NHS's 'Catch It, Bin It, Kill It' campaign, can slow the spread of the pandemic.\"<ref name=UCLresearchers/> The [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] later funded a [[randomised controlled trial]] to support evidence for the campaign. The message has been taught to children using an online game led by [[Public Health England]] (PHE), and a downloadable poster has been available, particularly targeted at primary care services in the UK.\n\nThe phrase and poster was revived by PHE in subsequent campaigns, including in 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] caused by [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], and has been included in the government's \"Action Plan\", unveiled on 3 March 2020 following a rise of [[COVID-19]] [[COVID-19 outbreak in the United Kingdom|cases in the UK]].\n\n==Slogan==\n\"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" is a [[slogan]]<ref name=Management2009>{{Cite web|url=https://managementinpractice.com/news/catch-it-kill-it-bin-it-swine-flu-campaign-begins/|title=Catch It, Kill It, Bin It: swine-flu campaign begins -|date=26 October 2009|website=Management in Practice|url-status=live|access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> and the name associated with [[Public Health England]]'s (PHE) annual public awareness campaigns for flu and [[norovirus]].<ref name=NIHR2015>{{Cite web|url=https://discover.dc.nihr.ac.uk/content/signal-000150/handwashing-advice-reduces-the-number-of-colds-and-their-severity|title=Handwashing advice reduces the number of colds and their severity|date=24 November 2015|website=discover.dc.nihr.ac.uk|publisher=NIHR Dissemination Centre|url-status=live|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=Stuart>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/public-health/why-behaviour-change-marketing-can-still-deliver-long-term-cost-savings/5037782.article|title=Why behaviour change marketing can still deliver long-term cost savings|last=Stuart|first=Mark Blayney|date=n.d.|website=[[Health Service Journal]]|url-status=live|access-date=4 March 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=Russell13Feb2020/> The slogan appears on a downloadable poster, published by PHE and particularly targeted at primary care services in the UK.<ref name=infectionpreventioncontrol/><ref name=PHE2019>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/campaign-warns-people-to-catch-it-bin-it-kill-it-to-stop-the-spread-of-flu|title=Campaign warns people to 'Catch it.

In 2007, following [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]] that good respiratory and hand hygiene might reduce the spread of [[influenza|flu]], the phrase appeared in a government campaign that publicised the directive \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" throughout the [[NHS]], on buses and trains and in libraries, shopping centres and police stations.\n\nIn 2009, the slogan received widespread attention when the government funded its use in a national media campaign in response to the [[2009 flu pandemic]] caused by [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|swine flu]]. In that year, funding was granted for research to study [[Behavior change (public health)|public behaviour]] and the effect of initiatives such as the campaigns using the slogan.
