It is now a business center whose commercial output runs parallel to that of downtown. A former terminus of the [[North Luzon Expressway]], it is the most urban and most populous area in Mabalacat, home to roughly 23% of the city's population.\n\nSan Francisco, the second largest barangay, along with San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Poblacion, Calumpang and other barangays are categorized as urban in view of their proximity to the city proper. Sapang Balen, with a population of 166 persons, is the smallest barangay.\n\n==History==\nPrior to 1712, Mabalacat was a barrio ([[barangay]]) of Bambang, now [[Bamban, Tarlac]]. It became a town in 1792, and was named after the abundant Balacat tree (''[[Ziziphus talanai]]''), a fourth class timber tree with bark that possess antimicrobial properties. Once a settlement of an [[Aeta]] tribe, the area was a virtual forest of balacat trees. \"''Ma-balacat''\" in the native [[Kapampangan language]] means \"full of Balacats.\" Mabalacat in [[Maranao language|Maranao]] is \"'''Mababaapalaqat'''\" (Palacat), which means \"'''maiksing hagdan'''\" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].\n\nIn 1853 Mabalacat had a population of 2,611 and four barangays, namely, Babangdapu, Duquit, Malabni, and Paglimbunan. By 1903 its population increased to 7,049 in 19 barangays. These were Bical, Bundagul, Dapdap, Dau, Dolores, Iba, Mabiga, Mamatitang, Mangalit, Matas, Mawaque, Paralayunan, Poblacion, Quitangil (later renamed to San Francisco), San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Santa Maria, Sapang Balen, and Sapang Biabas. In 1948, Mabalacat's barangays increased to 20 with the addition of [[Fort Stotsenburg]].\n\nIn 1860 a military command was established by authorities of the Spanish Governor-General due to the lawlessness and depredations perpetrated by the negritos (Aetas, or derogatorily called ''balugas''). The Pampanga towns of Bamban, [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], [[Victoria, Tarlac|Victoria]], [[Tarlac City|Tarlac]], [[Magalang, Pampanga|Magalang]], [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]], and [[Floridablanca, Pampanga|Floridablanca]] and Mabalacat were created into what was called a ''Commandancia Militar''. However, in 1873 the Military Command returned Mabalacat together with the towns of Magalang, Floridablanca, and Porac to the parent province, Pampanga.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Mabalacat\n| 1903 = 7049\n| 1918 = 9378\n| 1939 = 20560\n| 1948 = 25281\n| 1960 = 31752\n| 1970 = 55897\n| 1975 = 69874\n| 1980 = 80966\n| 1990 = 121115\n| 1995 = 129990\n| 2000 = 171045\n| 2007 = 203307\n| 2010 = 215610\n| 2015 = 250799\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location = Mabalacat ([[Clark International Airport]]) 1997\u20132010, extremes 1997\u20132012)\n| single line = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| Jan record high C = 33.5\n| Feb record high C = 34.9\n| Mar record high C = 36.5\n| Apr record high C = 37.0\n| May record high C = 37.0\n| Jun record high C = 35.6\n| Jul record high C = 34.6\n| Aug record high C = 34.6\n| Sep record high C = 34.1\n| Oct record high C = 33.9\n| Nov record high C = 33.8\n| Dec record high C = 34.0\n|year record high C = 37.0\n| Jan high C = 30.1\n| Feb high C = 31.0\n| Mar high C = 32.6\n| Apr high C = 34.0\n| May high C = 32.7\n| Jun high C = 31.5\n| Jul high C = 30.6\n| Aug high C = 30.1\n| Sep high C = 30.5\n| Oct high C = 31.1\n| Nov high C = 31.0\n| Dec high C = 30.2\n|year high C = 31.3\n| Jan mean C = 25.3\n| Feb mean C = 25.9\n| Mar mean C = 27.2\n| Apr mean C = 28.6\n| May mean C = 28.3\n| Jun mean C = 27.6\n| Jul mean C = 27.0\n| Aug mean C = 26.8\n| Sep mean C = 26.9\n| Oct mean C = 27.0\n| Nov mean C = 26.7\n| Dec mean C = 25.8\n|year mean C = 26.9\n| Jan low C = 20.5\n| Feb low C = 20.7\n| Mar low C = 21.8\n| Apr low C = 23.2\n| May low C = 23.9\n| Jun low C = 23.6\n| Jul low C = 23.5\n| Aug low C = 23.5\n| Sep low C = 23.2\n| Oct low C = 23.0\n| Nov low C = 22.4\n| Dec low C = 21.3\n|year low C = 22.6\n| Jan record low C = 15.8\n| Feb record low C = 16.9\n| Mar record low C = 17.9\n| Apr record low C = 19.5\n| May record low C = 19.8\n| Jun record low C = 20.8\n| Jul record low C = 21.1\n| Aug record low C = 21.7\n| Sep record low C = 20.0\n| Oct record low C = 19.5\n| Nov record low C = 17.4\n| Dec record low C = 17.0\n|year record low C = 15.8\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 17.4\n| Feb rain mm = 18.6\n| Mar rain mm = 28.4\n| Apr rain mm = 65.0\n| May rain mm = 221.8\n| Jun rain mm = 241.2\n| Jul rain mm = 422.6\n| Aug rain mm = 429.4\n| Sep rain mm = 293.1\n| Oct rain mm = 177.0\n| Nov rain mm = 78.0\n| Dec rain mm = 34.2\n|year rain mm = 2026.8\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 3\n| Feb rain days = 3\n| Mar rain days = 4\n| Apr rain days = 7\n| May rain days = 15\n| Jun rain days = 18\n| Jul rain days = 22\n| Aug rain days = 24\n| Sep rain days = 21\n| Oct rain days = 12\n| Nov rain days = 8\n| Dec rain days = 6\n|year rain days = 143\n| Jan humidity = 70\n| Feb humidity = 68\n| Mar humidity = 66\n| Apr humidity = 65\n| May humidity = 73\n| Jun humidity = 80\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 86\n| Sep humidity = 85\n| Oct humidity = 78\n| Nov humidity = 75\n| Dec humidity = 72\n|year humidity = 75\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181013040111/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaavvalclarkairpam1997-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 13 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/59f30681-af76-4dba-9491-c15b548e507a\n| title = Clark International Airport Pampanga Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 13 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181013040205/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrclarkintlairpam.csv\n| archivedate = 13 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/00aacace-59d9-4ec0-8796-6610970555b7\n| title = Clark International Airport Pampanga Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 13 October 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Mabalacat,Pampangajf5793 05.JPG|thumb|Centre of Mabalacat]]\n\nMabalacat has an average annual income of {{Philippine peso|504,149,053.16}} as of 2011 derived mostly from municipal license fees, land tax, Internal Revenue allotment, roads and bridges fund. In 1997, there were 2,447 business establishments registered in the Mabalacat City, consisting of 79 manufacturers mostly involved in sash factory, iron works, ceramics, bakery and 1,806 trading companies. The financial needs are served by eleven banks, mostly concentrated in Dau.\n\nPublic utilities include the Mabalacat Water System, Pampanga Electric Corporation II (PELCO II), three telephone companies namely, Datelcom Corporation (DATELCOM), [[Smart Communications]] (SMART) and [[Digital Telecommunications Philippines]], Incorporated (DIGITEL) and one cable television network (PRO-SAT) which runs solely for Mabalacat.\n\nThe city is also a major transportation hub; a number of major road networks including the [[North Luzon Expressway]], [[Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway]], and [[MacArthur Highway]] cut across the region. At the southern part of the city is the Dau Bus Terminal, which caters to passengers bound for [[Metro Manila]] and provinces in [[Northern Luzon]] such as [[Tarlac]], [[Pangasinan]], [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[La Union]], [[Bataan]], and [[Zambales]].\n\n== City Fiesta ==\n[[File:Fountain at Xevera, Mabalacat City, Pampanga, Philippines (7).jpg|thumb|220px|Xevera Fountain]]\n\nLegend tells us that when the early settlers were clearing the forests, Cabezang Laureana's workers found, hidden among the bushes, a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary with baby Jesus sitting on her lap. On February 2, the statue was presented by Caragan as a gift to Padre Maximo Manuguid, the priest of the early Mabalacat Church that was made of ''sawali'' and cogon grass.

It is now a business center whose commercial output runs parallel to that of downtown. A former terminus of the [[North Luzon Expressway]], it is the most urban and most populous area in Mabalacat, home to roughly 23% of the city's population.\n\nSan Francisco, the second largest barangay, along with San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Poblacion, Calumpang and other barangays are categorized as urban in view of their proximity to the city proper. Sapang Balen, with a population of 166 persons, is the smallest barangay.\n\n==History==\nPrior to 1712, Mabalacat was a barrio ([[barangay]]) of Bambang, now [[Bamban, Tarlac]]. It became a town in 1792, and was named after the abundant Balacat tree (''[[Ziziphus talanai]]''), a fourth class timber tree with bark that possess antimicrobial properties. Once a settlement of an [[Aeta]] tribe, the area was a virtual forest of balacat trees. \"''Ma-balacat''\" in the native [[Kapampangan language]] means \"full of Balacats.\" Mabalacat in [[Maranao language|Maranao]] is \"'''Mababaapalaqat'''\" (Palacat), which means \"'''maiksing hagdan'''\" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].\n\nIn 1853 Mabalacat had a population of 2,611 and four barangays, namely, Babangdapu, Duquit, Malabni, and Paglimbunan. By 1903 its population increased to 7,049 in 19 barangays. These were Bical, Bundagul, Dapdap, Dau, Dolores, Iba, Mabiga, Mamatitang, Mangalit, Matas, Mawaque, Paralayunan, Poblacion, Quitangil (later renamed to San Francisco), San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Santa Maria, Sapang Balen, and Sapang Biabas. In 1948, Mabalacat's barangays increased to 20 with the addition of [[Fort Stotsenburg]].\n\nIn 1860 a military command was established by authorities of the Spanish Governor-General due to the lawlessness and depredations perpetrated by the negritos (Aetas, or derogatorily called ''balugas''). The Pampanga towns of Bamban, [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], [[Victoria, Tarlac|Victoria]], [[Tarlac City|Tarlac]], [[Magalang, Pampanga|Magalang]], [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]], and [[Floridablanca, Pampanga|Floridablanca]] and Mabalacat were created into what was called a ''Commandancia Militar''. However, in 1873 the Military Command returned Mabalacat together with the towns of Magalang, Floridablanca, and Porac to the parent province, Pampanga.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Mabalacat\n| 1903 = 7049\n| 1918 = 9378\n| 1939 = 20560\n| 1948 = 25281\n| 1960 = 31752\n| 1970 = 55897\n| 1975 = 69874\n| 1980 = 80966\n| 1990 = 121115\n| 1995 = 129990\n| 2000 = 171045\n| 2007 = 203307\n| 2010 = 215610\n| 2015 = 250799\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location = Mabalacat ([[Clark International Airport]]) 1997\u20132010, extremes 1997\u20132012)\n| single line = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| Jan record high C = 33.5\n| Feb record high C = 34.9\n| Mar record high C = 36.5\n| Apr record high C = 37.0\n| May record high C = 37.0\n| Jun record high C = 35.6\n| Jul record high C = 34.6\n| Aug record high C = 34.6\n| Sep record high C = 34.1\n| Oct record high C = 33.9\n| Nov record high C = 33.8\n| Dec record high C = 34.0\n|year record high C = 37.0\n| Jan high C = 30.1\n| Feb high C = 31.0\n| Mar high C = 32.6\n| Apr high C = 34.0\n| May high C = 32.7\n| Jun high C = 31.5\n| Jul high C = 30.6\n| Aug high C = 30.1\n| Sep high C = 30.5\n| Oct high C = 31.1\n| Nov high C = 31.0\n| Dec high C = 30.2\n|year high C = 31.3\n| Jan mean C = 25.3\n| Feb mean C = 25.9\n| Mar mean C = 27.2\n| Apr mean C = 28.6\n| May mean C = 28.3\n| Jun mean C = 27.6\n| Jul mean C = 27.0\n| Aug mean C = 26.8\n| Sep mean C = 26.9\n| Oct mean C = 27.0\n| Nov mean C = 26.7\n| Dec mean C = 25.8\n|year mean C = 26.9\n| Jan low C = 20.5\n| Feb low C = 20.7\n| Mar low C = 21.8\n| Apr low C = 23.2\n| May low C = 23.9\n| Jun low C = 23.6\n| Jul low C = 23.5\n| Aug low C = 23.5\n| Sep low C = 23.2\n| Oct low C = 23.0\n| Nov low C = 22.4\n| Dec low C = 21.3\n|year low C = 22.6\n| Jan record low C = 15.8\n| Feb record low C = 16.9\n| Mar record low C = 17.9\n| Apr record low C = 19.5\n| May record low C = 19.8\n| Jun record low C = 20.8\n| Jul record low C = 21.1\n| Aug record low C = 21.7\n| Sep record low C = 20.0\n| Oct record low C = 19.5\n| Nov record low C = 17.4\n| Dec record low C = 17.0\n|year record low C = 15.8\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 17.4\n| Feb rain mm = 18.6\n| Mar rain mm = 28.4\n| Apr rain mm = 65.0\n| May rain mm = 221.8\n| Jun rain mm = 241.2\n| Jul rain mm = 422.6\n| Aug rain mm = 429.4\n| Sep rain mm = 293.1\n| Oct rain mm = 177.0\n| Nov rain mm = 78.0\n| Dec rain mm = 34.2\n|year rain mm = 2026.8\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 3\n| Feb rain days = 3\n| Mar rain days = 4\n| Apr rain days = 7\n| May rain days = 15\n| Jun rain days = 18\n| Jul rain days = 22\n| Aug rain days = 24\n| Sep rain days = 21\n| Oct rain days = 12\n| Nov rain days = 8\n| Dec rain days = 6\n|year rain days = 143\n| Jan humidity = 70\n| Feb humidity = 68\n| Mar humidity = 66\n| Apr humidity = 65\n| May humidity = 73\n| Jun humidity = 80\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 86\n| Sep humidity = 85\n| Oct humidity = 78\n| Nov humidity = 75\n| Dec humidity = 72\n|year humidity = 75\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181013040111/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaavvalclarkairpam1997-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 13 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/59f30681-af76-4dba-9491-c15b548e507a\n| title = Clark International Airport Pampanga Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 13 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181013040205/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrclarkintlairpam.csv\n| archivedate = 13 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/00aacace-59d9-4ec0-8796-6610970555b7\n| title = Clark International Airport Pampanga Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 13 October 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Mabalacat,Pampangajf5793 05.JPG|thumb|Centre of Mabalacat]]\n\nMabalacat has an average annual income of {{Philippine peso|504,149,053.16}} as of 2011 derived mostly from municipal license fees, land tax, Internal Revenue allotment, roads and bridges fund.
