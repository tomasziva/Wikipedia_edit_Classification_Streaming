They are divided between the 37 Great Nats and all the rest (i.e., spirits of trees, water, etc.). Almost all of the 37 Great Nats were human beings who met violent deaths ({{lang|my|\u1005\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1038\u101e\u1031}}, lit. \"green death\").

Some Burmese might say spirit worship is superstition and downplay its role in society. The formalizing of the official 37 Nats by King [[Anawrahta]] (1044\u20131077) of [[Bagan]], has been interpreted as Burmanisation and establishment of Bamar supremacy in the [[Ayeyarwady Region|Irrawaddy]] valley after the unification of the country and founding of the First Burmese Empire.<ref name=\"BBP\"/>\nWorship of nats predates Buddhism in Burma.

They are flawed, having desires considered derogatory and immoral in mainstream Buddhism. During a ''nat pw\u00e8'', which is a festival during which nats are propitiated, ''nat kadaw''s ({{lang|my|\u1014\u1010\u103a\u1000\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a}} \"lord-consort\",<ref name=\"Ho\">{{cite journal|last=Ho|first=Tamara C.|author2=Discourse|date=Fall 2009|title=Transgender, Transgression, and Translation: A Cartography of Nat Kadaws|volume=31|issue=3|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/discourse/v031/31.3.ho.html}}</ref> i.e. \"[[mediumship|medium]], [[shamanism|shaman]]\") dance and embody the nat's spirit in a trance.

Since the 1980s, persons identified by outsiders as [[trans woman|trans women]] or [[transvestism|gay male transvestites]] have increasingly performed these roles.<ref name=\"Ho\" />\n\nMusic, often accompanied by a [[hsaing waing]] (\"orchestra\"), adds much to the mood of the ''nat pw\u00e8'', and many are entranced. People come from far to take part in the festivities in various nat shrines called ''nat kun'' or ''nat naan'', get drunk on [[palm wine]] and dance wildly in fits of ecstasy to the wild beat of the Hsaing waing music, possessed by the nats.<ref name=\"mha\"/>\n\nWhereas ''nat pw\u00e8''s are annual events celebrating a particular member of the 37 Nats regarded as the tutelary spirit in a local region within a local community, with familial custodians of the place and tradition and with royal sponsorship in ancient times, hence evocative of royal rituals, there are also ''nat kannah pw\u00e8''s where individuals would have a pavilion set up in a neighbourhood and the ritual is generally linked to the entire pantheon of nats. The ''nat kadaw''s as an independent profession made their appearance in the latter half of the 19th century as spirit mediums, and ''nat kannah''s are more of an urban phenomenon which evolved to satisfy the need of people who had migrated from the countryside to towns and cities but who wished to carry on their traditions or ''yo-ya'' of supplicating the ''mi hsaing hpa hsaing'' tutelary spirit of their native place.<ref name=\"BBP\"/>\n\n==List of official nats==\n[[File:IMG banana-offering.JPG|thumb|Traditional offerings of bananas and coconut at a nat shrine]]\n[[File:Brother Nats.JPG|thumb|Me Wunna with her sons [[Shwe Hpyin Naungdaw|Min Gyi]] and [[Shwe Hpyin Nyidaw|Min Lay]] at Mount Popa]]\nKing [[Anawrahta]] of Bagan (1044\u20131077) designated an official pantheon of 37 nats after he had failed to enforce a ban on nat worship.

Some Burmese might say spirit worship is superstition and downplay its role in society. The formalizing of the official 37 Nats by King [[Anawrahta]] (1044\u20131077) of [[Bagan]], has been interpreted as Burmanisation and establishment of Bamar supremacy in the [[Ayeyarwady Region|Irrawaddy]] valley after the unification of the country and founding of the First Burmese Empire.<ref name=\"BBP\"/>\nWorship of nats predates Buddhism in Burma.

They are flawed, having desires considered derogatory and immoral in mainstream Buddhism. During a ''nat pw\u00e8'', which is a festival during which nats are propitiated, ''nat kadaw''s ({{lang|my|\u1014\u1010\u103a\u1000\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a}} \"lord-consort\",<ref name=\"Ho\">{{cite journal|last=Ho|first=Tamara C.|author2=Discourse|date=Fall 2009|title=Transgender, Transgression, and Translation: A Cartography of Nat Kadaws|volume=31|issue=3|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/discourse/v031/31.3.ho.html}}</ref> i.e. \"[[mediumship|medium]], [[shamanism|shaman]]\") dance and embody the nat's spirit in a trance. Historically, the ''nat kadaw'' profession was hereditary and passed from mother to daughter. Until the 1980s, few ''nat gadaw''s were male. Since the 1980s, persons identified by outsiders as [[trans woman|trans women]] or [[transvestism|gay male transvestites]] have increasingly performed these roles.<ref name=\"Ho\" />\n\nMusic, often accompanied by a [[hsaing waing]] (\"orchestra\"), adds much to the mood of the ''nat pw\u00e8'', and many are entranced. People come from far to take part in the festivities in various nat shrines called ''nat kun'' or ''nat naan'', get drunk on [[palm wine]] and dance wildly in fits of ecstasy to the wild beat of the Hsaing waing music, possessed by the nats.<ref name=\"mha\"/>\n\nWhereas ''nat pw\u00e8''s are annual events celebrating a particular member of the 37 Nats regarded as the tutelary spirit in a local region within a local community, with familial custodians of the place and tradition and with royal sponsorship in ancient times, hence evocative of royal rituals, there are also ''nat kannah pw\u00e8''s where individuals would have a pavilion set up in a neighbourhood and the ritual is generally linked to the entire pantheon of nats. The ''nat kadaw''s as an independent profession made their appearance in the latter half of the 19th century as spirit mediums, and ''nat kannah''s are more of an urban phenomenon which evolved to satisfy the need of people who had migrated from the countryside to towns and cities but who wished to carry on their traditions or ''yo-ya'' of supplicating the ''mi hsaing hpa hsaing'' tutelary spirit of their native place.<ref name=\"BBP\"/>\n\n==List of official nats==\n[[File:IMG banana-offering.JPG|thumb|Traditional offerings of bananas and coconut at a nat shrine]]\n[[File:Brother Nats.JPG|thumb|Me Wunna with her sons [[Shwe Hpyin Naungdaw|Min Gyi]] and [[Shwe Hpyin Nyidaw|Min Lay]] at Mount Popa]]\nKing [[Anawrahta]] of Bagan (1044\u20131077) designated an official pantheon of 37 nats after he had failed to enforce a ban on nat worship. His stratagem of incorporation eventually succeeded by bringing nats to [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] portrayed worshipping [[Gautama Buddha]] and by enlisting [[\u015aakra (Buddhism)|\u015aakra]] , a [[dharmapala|Buddhist protective deity]], to head the pantheon above the Mahagiri nats as [[Thagyamin]].<ref name=\"mha\"/><ref name=\"RDeC\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qs2SB4XanBUC&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=nat+spirits&source=web&ots=4T1_i7nCyX&sig=xtDhIDMENUn3bxxoZRYXjJDYKzI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA158,M1|title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism|last=DeCaroli|first=Robert|year=2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], US|accessdate=2008-09-13 | isbn=978-0-19-516838-9}}</ref> Seven out of the 37 Nats appear to be directly associated with the life and times of Anawrahta.<ref name=\"RDeC\"/>\n\nThe official pantheon is made up predominantly of those from the royal houses of [[History of Burma|Burmese history]], but also contains nats of [[Thai people|Thai]] (Yun Bayin) and [[Shan people|Shan]] (Maung Po Tu) descent; illustrations of them show them in Burmese royal dress.
