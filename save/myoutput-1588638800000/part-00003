Originally, a total of 27 ships were planned, but due to programme delays and overruns, only six were eventually ordered. Their construction began in the early 2000s, and by 2009, all six were in active service. Presently, they are the most modern surface ships in the Royal Malaysian Navy. The six vessels are named after [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|Malaysian states]].\n\n==Classification==\nWhile their size and tonnage implies the ''Kedah''-class ships to be [[corvette]]s, they are classified as ''offshore patrol vessels'' (OPVs) by the Royal Malaysian Navy, a category more common with law enforcement or coast guard vessels, not naval warships. This is rooted in the fact that the ''Kedah'' class was delivered in a condition named ''[[for but not with]]'', meaning that certain weapon systems were not included in the original purchase, but all provisions to install and use them, including sensors and electronics, are already present in the ships. The weapons themselves can be easily \"plugged in\" with little delay as soon as the Malaysian Navy has purchased them. These purchases however have not yet been made. Currently, the ''Kedah''-class vessels are armed with guns only (76&nbsp;mm gun on the bow, 30&nbsp;mm gun on the aft), making them quite lightly armed and fairly vulnerable for naval ships of their size, thus justifying their listing as OPVs rather than proper corvettes.<ref>Hooten, Ted (1 August 2013): ''[http://www.asianmilitaryreview.com/corvettes-opvs-offshore-investments/ Corvettes and OPVs: Offshore Investments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112235326/http://www.asianmilitaryreview.com/corvettes-opvs-offshore-investments/ |date=2015-01-12 }}''.
