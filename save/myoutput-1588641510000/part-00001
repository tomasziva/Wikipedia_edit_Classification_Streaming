As time went on and the paisley shawls began to integrate more into western culture, the design was worn less for ceremonial purposes and came to be seen by society more as a fashionable style of clothing.  With the shift in how western cultures wore paisley, it eventually became a style primarily worn by women instead of men.

Today, the design can be found in all aspects of our culture, for example the design appears on jewelry, wedding gloves, suit ties, pocket books, cake decorations, tattoos, mouse pads for computers, scarfs, and dresses just to name a few things, the list goes on and on.

It was popular in the [[Baltic states]] between 1700 and 1800 and was thought to be used as a protective charm to ward away demons.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nLocal manufacturers in [[Marseille]] began to mass-produce the patterns via early [[textile printing]] processes at 1640.  England, circa 1670, and [[Holland]], in 1678, soon followed.  This, in turn, provided Europe's weavers with more competition than they could bear, and the production and import of printed paisley was forbidden in France by royal decree from 1686 to 1759.  However, enforcement near the end of that period was lax, and France had its own printed textile manufacturing industry in place as early at 1746 in some locales.  Paisley was not the only design produced by French textile printers; the demand for paisley which created the industry there also made possible production of native patterns such as ''[[toile#Toile de Jouy|toile de Jouy]]''.<ref name=\"PROHIBIT\">{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.musee-impression.com/gb/collection/xviii.html | contribution = The Prohibition Years, 1686\u20131759 | title = Le Mus\u00e9e de l'Impression sur Etoffes |trans-title=The Museum of Printed Textiles | accessdate = February 3, 2008}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, European production of paisley increased, particularly in the Scottish town from which the pattern takes its modern name.

Unique additions to their hand-looms and Jacquard looms allowed them to work in five colours when most weavers were producing paisley using only two.<ref name=\"VICTORIANA\"/>  The design became known as the ''Paisley pattern''.  By 1860, Paisley could produce shawls with 15 colours, which was still only a quarter of the colors in the multicolour paisleys then still being imported from Kashmir.<ref name=\"VICTORIANA\" />\nIn addition to the loom-woven fabric, the town of Paisley became a major site for the manufacture of printed [[cotton]] and [[wool]] in the 19th century, according to the [[Paisley Museum and Art Galleries]].<ref name=\"MUSUEM\">{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.aboutbritain.com/PaisleyMuseumAndArtGallery.htm | contribution = Paisley Museum and Art Gallery | title = About Britain}}.</ref>  The paisley pattern was being printed, rather than woven, onto other textiles, including cotton squares which were the precursors of the modern [[bandanna]].

In early Iranian culture, the design was woven onto Termeh, one of the most valuable materials in early Iran where the design served to make clothing for the nobility.  At this time, the Iranian nobility wore distinct uniforms called Khalaat, historically, the design was commonly found on the Khalaat uniforms.<ref name=\":42\"/> It is stated that at some point in the 15th century, Boteh was transported from Persia to Kashmir.<ref name=\":32\" />  In the same century, in the 1400s, some of the earliest recorded Kashmir shawls were produced in India, records from the 1500s, during Emperor Akbar's reign over the Mughal people in this area indicate that shawl making was already fashionable in India prior to Mughal conquest which took place in the early 1400s.<ref name=\":52\"/>  It has been stated that during Emperor Akbars reign over the Mughal empire, Boteh Jehgeh shawls were extremely popular and fashionable.  While one shawl was traditionally worn previously, it was during the rule of Emperor Akbar that the emperor decided to wear two shawls at a time to serve as a status symbol.  Along with wearing the shawls frequently, Emperor Akbar also used the shawls as gifts to other rulers and high officials.<ref name=\":52\" />  It is believed that by the 18th century, Kashmir shawls were produced in the image that someone today would associate with modern paisley.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n== Paisley bandanas ==\n\nWhile today, we associate paisley bandanas with cowboys, paisley bandanas served an integral item in American fashion history.  The paisley bandana as we know it today was made popular during the late 1700s and their popularity in the United States coincide with the American revolution.  [[George Washington]] is said to have worn a paisley bandana as a scarf, the popular way of wearing bandanas at that time.  Eventually in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, paisley bandanas were being printed containing political and military advertisements on them.  Bandanas became an increasingly utilized tool in the spread of pro war propaganda during the early and mid 20th century when [[World War 1]] and [[World War 2]] were being fought.  It was thought that by purchasing and sporting your pro war paisley bandana, you were helping to support your country in winning the war.The paisley bandana was also seen as a symbol of women's [[Suffragettes|sufferance]] in the Unite States, with the famous \"Rosie the Riveter\" poster model wearing a paisley bandana in the poster.  The Paisley bandana started to feature in countless numbers of western movies and thus took on the symbol of the American west.  Previous to the 1970s, paisley bandanas were worn by many blue collar and labor workers in an effort to keep dust away from their mouths and noses, the bandana's symbolism once again shifted in American minds, being associated with hard work.  In the 1960s, famous country singer Willie Nelson adopted the paisley bandana style, and the trend soon become popular with men who rode Harley Davidson motorcycles.  It was not until the 1970s that the paisley bandana would be associated with United States gang culture.  It was around this time that paisley bandanas were starting to become popular amongst gangs in California, predominantly with two opposing gangs, the bloods who would wear red bandanas and the crips who would wear blue bandanas.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-18|title=Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia2016 010 Edited by Annette Lynch and Mitchell D.Strauss Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia Lanham, MD Rowman & Littlefield 2015 x + 326 pp. 9780759121485(print) 9780759121508(e-book) \u00a349.95 $75|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=17|doi=10.1108/rr-09-2015-0225|issn=0950-4125}}</ref>\n[[File:Tie (AM 1996.180.4-4).jpg|thumb|Modern men's tie, before 1996]]\nPaisley became identified with [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] style due to a resurgence in the pattern's mainstream popularity leading up the mid- and late 1960s, partly due to [[The Beatles]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20151021-paisley-behind-rocks-favourite-fashion | title=Paisley: The story of a classic bohemian print}}</ref> Consequently, the style was particularly popular during the [[Summer of Love]] in 1967.

As time went on and the paisley shawls began to integrate more into western culture, the design was worn less for ceremonial purposes and came to be seen by society more as a fashionable style of clothing.  With the shift in how western cultures wore paisley, it eventually became a style primarily worn by women instead of men.

Today, the design can be found in all aspects of our culture, for example the design appears on jewelry, wedding gloves, suit ties, pocket books, cake decorations, tattoos, mouse pads for computers, scarfs, and dresses just to name a few things, the list goes on and on.

England, circa 1670, and [[Holland]], in 1678, soon followed.  This, in turn, provided Europe's weavers with more competition than they could bear, and the production and import of printed paisley was forbidden in France by royal decree from 1686 to 1759.  However, enforcement near the end of that period was lax, and France had its own printed textile manufacturing industry in place as early at 1746 in some locales.  Paisley was not the only design produced by French textile printers; the demand for paisley which created the industry there also made possible production of native patterns such as ''[[toile#Toile de Jouy|toile de Jouy]]''.<ref name=\"PROHIBIT\">{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.musee-impression.com/gb/collection/xviii.html | contribution = The Prohibition Years, 1686\u20131759 | title = Le Mus\u00e9e de l'Impression sur Etoffes |trans-title=The Museum of Printed Textiles | accessdate = February 3, 2008}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, European production of paisley increased, particularly in the Scottish town from which the pattern takes its modern name.

Unique additions to their hand-looms and Jacquard looms allowed them to work in five colours when most weavers were producing paisley using only two.<ref name=\"VICTORIANA\"/>  The design became known as the ''Paisley pattern''.  By 1860, Paisley could produce shawls with 15 colours, which was still only a quarter of the colors in the multicolour paisleys then still being imported from Kashmir.<ref name=\"VICTORIANA\" />\nIn addition to the loom-woven fabric, the town of Paisley became a major site for the manufacture of printed [[cotton]] and [[wool]] in the 19th century, according to the [[Paisley Museum and Art Galleries]].<ref name=\"MUSUEM\">{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.aboutbritain.com/PaisleyMuseumAndArtGallery.htm | contribution = Paisley Museum and Art Gallery | title = About Britain}}.</ref>  The paisley pattern was being printed, rather than woven, onto other textiles, including cotton squares which were the precursors of the modern [[bandanna]].

In early Iranian culture, the design was woven onto Termeh, one of the most valuable materials in early Iran where the design served to make clothing for the nobility.  At this time, the Iranian nobility wore distinct uniforms called Khalaat, historically, the design was commonly found on the Khalaat uniforms.<ref name=\":42\"/> It is stated that at some point in the 15th century, Boteh was transported from Persia to Kashmir.<ref name=\":32\" />  In the same century, in the 1400s, some of the earliest recorded Kashmir shawls were produced in India, records from the 1500s, during Emperor Akbar's reign over the Mughal people in this area indicate that shawl making was already fashionable in India prior to Mughal conquest which took place in the early 1400s.<ref name=\":52\"/>  It has been stated that during Emperor Akbars reign over the Mughal empire, Boteh Jehgeh shawls were extremely popular and fashionable.  While one shawl was traditionally worn previously, it was during the rule of Emperor Akbar that the emperor decided to wear two shawls at a time to serve as a status symbol.  Along with wearing the shawls frequently, Emperor Akbar also used the shawls as gifts to other rulers and high officials.<ref name=\":52\" />  It is believed that by the 18th century, Kashmir shawls were produced in the image that someone today would associate with modern paisley.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n== Paisley bandanas ==\n\nWhile today, we associate paisley bandanas with cowboys, paisley bandanas served an integral item in American fashion history.  The paisley bandana as we know it today was made popular during the late 1700s and their popularity in the United States coincide with the American revolution.  [[George Washington]] is said to have worn a paisley bandana as a scarf, the popular way of wearing bandanas at that time.  Eventually in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, paisley bandanas were being printed containing political and military advertisements on them.  Bandanas became an increasingly utilized tool in the spread of pro war propaganda during the early and mid 20th century when [[World War 1]] and [[World War 2]] were being fought.  It was thought that by purchasing and sporting your pro war paisley bandana, you were helping to support your country in winning the war.The paisley bandana was also seen as a symbol of women's [[Suffragettes|sufferance]] in the Unite States, with the famous \"Rosie the Riveter\" poster model wearing a paisley bandana in the poster.  The Paisley bandana started to feature in countless numbers of western movies and thus took on the symbol of the American west.  Previous to the 1970s, paisley bandanas were worn by many blue collar and labor workers in an effort to keep dust away from their mouths and noses, the bandana's symbolism once again shifted in American minds, being associated with hard work.  In the 1960s, famous country singer Willie Nelson adopted the paisley bandana style, and the trend soon become popular with men who rode Harley Davidson motorcycles.  It was not until the 1970s that the paisley bandana would be associated with United States gang culture.  It was around this time that paisley bandanas were starting to become popular amongst gangs in California, predominantly with two opposing gangs, the bloods who would wear red bandanas and the crips who would wear blue bandanas.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-18|title=Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia2016 010 Edited by Annette Lynch and Mitchell D.Strauss Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia Lanham, MD Rowman & Littlefield 2015 x + 326 pp. 9780759121485(print) 9780759121508(e-book) \u00a349.95 $75|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=17|doi=10.1108/rr-09-2015-0225|issn=0950-4125}}</ref>\n[[File:Tie (AM 1996.180.4-4).jpg|thumb|Modern men's tie, before 1996]]\nPaisley became identified with [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] style due to a resurgence in the pattern's mainstream popularity leading up the mid- and late 1960s, partly due to [[The Beatles]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20151021-paisley-behind-rocks-favourite-fashion | title=Paisley: The story of a classic bohemian print}}</ref> Consequently, the style was particularly popular during the [[Summer of Love]] in 1967.
