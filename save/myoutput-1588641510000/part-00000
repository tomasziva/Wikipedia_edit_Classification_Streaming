Factual texts merely seek to inform, whereas literary texts seek to entertain or otherwise engage the reader by using creative language and imagery. There are many aspects to literary writing, and many ways to analyse it, but four basic categories are [[Descriptive writing|descriptive]], [[narrative]], [[expository]], and [[argumentative]].\n\n==Descriptive text type==\nBased on perception in space. ''Impressionistic'' of [[landscapes]] or persons are often to be found in narratives such as [[novels]] or [[short stories]]. Example: ''About fifteen miles below Monterey, on the wild coast, the Torres family had their farm, a few sloping acres above the cliff that dropped to the brown reefs and to the hissing white waters of the ocean.''\n\n;Purpose\nDescription is used in all forms of writing to create a vivid impression of a person, place, object or event e.g. to: \n* describe a special place and explain why it is special.\n* describe the most important person in your life.\n\n[[Descriptive writing]] is usually used to help a writer develop an aspect of their work, e.g. to create a particular mood, atmosphere or describe a place so that the reader can [[imagery|create vivid pictures]] of characters, places, objects etc.\n\n;Features\nDescription is a style of writing which can be useful for a variety of purposes: \n* to engage a reader's attention\n* to create characters \n* to set a mood\n\n;Language\n* aims to show rather than tell the reader what something/someone is like. \n* relies on precisely chosen vocabulary with carefully chosen [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]]. \n* is focused and concentrates only on the aspects that add something to the main purpose of the description. \n* [[sense|sensory]] description - what is heard, seen, smell, felt, tasted. Precise use of adjectives, [[similes]], [[metaphors]] to create images/pictures in the mind e.g. their noses were met with the acrid smell of rotting flesh. \n* strong development of the experience that \"puts the reader there\" focuses on key details, powerful verbs and precise [[nouns]].\n\n==Narrative text type==\nBased on perception in time. [[Narration]] is the telling of a [[narrative|story]]; the succession of events is given in [[chronological order]].\n\n;Purpose\nThe basic purpose of narrative is to entertain, to gain and hold readers' interest. However narratives can also be written to teach or inform, to change attitudes / social opinions e.g. [[soap operas]] and television dramas that are used to raise topical issues. Narratives sequence people/characters in time and place but differ from recounts in that through the sequencing, the stories set up one or more problems, which must eventually find a way to be resolved. \nThe common structure or basic plan of narrative text is known as the \"story grammar\". Although there are numerous variations of the story grammar, the typical elements are:\n* [[Setting (narrative)|Settings]] \u2014 when and where the story occurs.\n* [[Character (arts)|Characters]]\u2014 the most important people or characters in the story.\n* Initiating event \u2014 an action or occurrence that establishes a problem and/or goal.\n* [[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]s/goal \u2014 the [[wikt:focal point|focal point]] around which the whole story is organized.\n* Events \u2014 one or more attempts by the main character(s) to achieve the goal or solve the problem.\n* [[wikt:resolution|Resolutions]] \u2014 the outcome of the attempts to achieve the goal\n\nThe graphic representation of these story grammar elements is called a story map. The exact form and complexity of a map depends, of course, upon the unique structure of each narrative and the personal preference of the teacher constructing the map.\n\n;Types\nThere are many types of narrative. They can be imaginary, factual or a combination of both. They may include [[fairy stories]], [[mystery fiction|mysteries]], [[Science fiction genre|science fiction]], [[Romance genre|romances]], [[Horror (genre)|horror stories]], [[Adventure (genre)|adventure stories]], [[fables]], [[myths and legends]], [[historical narrative]]s, [[ballads]], [[slice of life]], personal experience.\n\nFeatures:\n* Characters with defined personalities/identities. \n* Dialogue often included - [[Verb tense|tense]] may change to the present or the future. \n* Descriptive language to create images in the reader's mind and enhance the story.\n\n;Structure\nIn a Traditional Narrative the focus of the text is on a series of actions: \n:;Orientation: (Introduction) in which the characters, setting, and time of the story are established. Usually answers who? When? Where? E.g. Mr. Wolf went out hunting in the forest one dark gloomy night.\n\n:;Complication or problem: The complication usually involves the main character(s) (often mirroring the complications in real life).\n\n:;Resolution: There needs to be a resolution of the complication. The complication may be resolved for better or worse/happily or unhappily. Sometimes there are a number of complications that have to be resolved. These add and sustain interest and suspense for the reader.\n\nFurther more, when there is plan for writing narrative texts, the focus should be on the following characteristics:\n*[[Plot (narrative)|Plot]]: What is going to happen? \n*[[Setting (narrative)|Setting]]: Where will the story take place? When will the story take place? \n*[[Characterization]]: Who are the [[main characters]]? What do they look like? \n*Structure: How will the story begin? What will be the problem? How is the problem going to be resolved? \n*[[Theme (narrative)|Theme]]: What is the theme / message the writer is attempting to communicate?\n\n==Expository text type==\nIt aims at explanation, i.e. the cognitive analysis and subsequent syntheses of complex [[fact]]s. Example: An essay on \"Rhetoric: What is it and why do we study it?\"\n\nThere is a chance that your work may fall flat if you have not chosen one of the really good expository essay topics. Not all topics out there are interesting or meaty enough to be thoroughly investigated within a paper. Make sure you put effort into choosing a topic that has a lot of material to cover it and pique the interest of readers!\n* Trending Topics: Are there any hot issues that deserve some deep discussion? If so, consider educating people on this seemingly new occurrence through the use of a well-written essay.\n** <code>Example: Cultural and Historical Shifts.</code>\n* A topic close to your heart: It is easy much easier to defend a thesis if you find yourself passionately thinking about the topic. If you have an advocacy and want to inform others, choose this path and you might be able to sway beliefs!\nComparing the past and the present is a good way of framing an argument, especially if a lot has been written about it.\n\n==Argumentative text type==\nBased on the [[evaluation]] and the subsequent [[subjective judgement]] in answer to a problem. It refers to the reasons advanced for or against a matter. The writer usually argues with another side to convince the reader to join a certain side.\n\n==Literature==\nA literary text is a piece of writing, such as a book or poem, that has the purpose of telling a story or entertaining, as in a fictional novel. Its primary function as a text is usually aesthetic, but it may also contain political messages or beliefs. American schoolchildren and their parents are taught that literary texts contrast with informational texts that have the purpose of providing information rather than entertainment. Informational texts, such as science briefs and history books, are increasingly receiving emphasis in public school curricula as part of the Common Core State Standards. As a result, many parents have challenged the idea that literary texts are of less pedagogical value than informational ones.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conflation of Readings]]\n* [[Text linguistics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/TextTypes.html |title= Text Types And Textual Kinship |accessdate=2011-03-05 |author=Waltz, Robert |work=A Site Inspired By: The Encyclopedia of New Testament Textual Criticism }}\n\n[[Category:Writing]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|text types of the New Testament|Categories of New Testament manuscripts}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n{{context|date=February 2010}}\n{{essay-like|date=April 2019}}\n}}\n'''Text types''' in literature form the basic styles of writing.
