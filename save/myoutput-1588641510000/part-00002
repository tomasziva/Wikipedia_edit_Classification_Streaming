{"title_page": "Utagawa Toyokuni", "text_new": "{{japanese name|Utagawa}}\n\n[[File:Toyokuni Utagawa I by Kunisada cropped.jpg|thumb|Toyokuni Utagawa by [[Kunisada]]]]\n'''Utagawa Toyokuni''' ({{lang-ja|\u6b4c\u5ddd\u8c4a\u56fd}}; 1769 in [[Edo]]&nbsp;\u2013 24&nbsp;February 1825 in Edo), also often referred to as '''Toyokuni I''', to distinguish him from the [[Utagawa school|members of his school]] who took over his ''g\u014d'' ([[art-name]]) after he died, was a great master of [[ukiyo-e]], known in particular for his [[kabuki]] actor prints. He was the second head of the renowned [[Utagawa school]] of Japanese woodblock artists, and was the artist who really moved it to the position of great fame and power it occupied for the rest of the nineteenth century.\n\n==Biography==\n\nHe was born in Edo, the son of Kurahashi Gorobei, a carver of dolls and puppets, including replicas of kabuki actors.<ref>Percival 1978, 30</ref> At around 14, Toyokuni was apprenticed to the first head of the Utagawa house, Utagawa [[Toyoharu]], whom his father knew well and who lived nearby.<ref>Chiappa 2013</ref> One of his fellow pupils under Toyoharu was [[Toyohiro]], whose pupil was the great landscape artist [[Hiroshige]]. In recognition of his artistic ability, Toyokuni later took the name Utagawa Toyokuni, following the common practice of using one syllable of his master's name.<ref>Percival 1978, 30</ref>\n\nToyokuni seems not to have been an \"intuitive genius\"<ref>Chiappa 2012</ref> determined to forge a new path; rather, he seems to have studied intently those who came before him, particularly [[Utamaro]], Ch\u014dbunsai Eishi and [[Eish\u014dsai Ch\u014dki]].<ref>Percival 1978, 30</ref> and through a great deal of hard work produced first a mastery, and then a synthesis of their styles, to create a style of his own.<ref>Newland 2005, 502</ref>\n\nHe was known mostly for his prints related to the kabuki theatre, in particular his ''[[yakusha-e]]'' actor portraits, a field which he took to new heights. He also, however, produced other genres such as ''[[musha-e]]'' warrior prints, ''[[shunga]]'' erotica, and most notably ''[[bijin-ga]]''.<ref>Marks 2010, 96</ref>\n\n[[Image:ToyokuniActor.jpg|thumb|Onoe Eisaburo I, {{circa|1800}}]]\n[[Image:ToyokuniKabukiduo.jpg|thumb|Ichikawa Komazo and Ichikawa Yaozo; circa 1800]]\nIn his actor prints, like [[Sharaku]], one sees the real subject; but his prints merely portrayed what he saw, unlike Sharaku who exaggerated those aspects he saw as the most key. It is said of Toyokuni's prints that they recreate exactly what one would see on stage; they show actors acting, not merely just pictures of actors.<ref>Tazawa 1981, 346</ref> Together, these characteristics made Toyokuni's prints far more popular among theatre-goers than Sharaku's,<ref>Tazawa 1981, 346</ref> although history has come to judge Sharaku the keener observer and greater artist.<ref>Chiappa 2013</ref>\n\nHis popularity and prolific output<ref>According to Marks, by the time of his death at age 57, Toyokuni had produced more than 90 print series, over 400 illustrated books, and several hundred single sheet prints. (2010, 96)</ref> may in part have been his undoing, though. From 1803 through 1817, his work became more static, even as it became more popular. He continued to produce large quantities of prints, but the quality as a rule did not match that of his earlier days. Occasional prints from this period, however, show his old brilliance.<ref>Waterhouse 1975, 200</ref>\n\nHe died in [[Edo]] in 1825 aged 57, surrounded by many of his pupils.<ref>Waterhouse 1975, 200</ref>\n\n==Names==\n\nLike most Edo period Japanese artists, Toyokuni was known by several names throughout his lifetime, some sequentially and some concurrently.\n\n* Family name (\u59d3 - ''sei''): Kurahashi (\u5009\u6a4b)<ref>Tazawa 1981, 347</ref>\n* Childhood name (\u5e7c\u540d - ''y\u014dmy\u014d''): Kumakichi (\u718a\u5409)<ref>Tazawa 1981, 347</ref> \n* Nickname (\u901a\u79f0 - ''ts\u016bsh\u014d''): Kumaemon (\u718a\u53f3\u885b\u9580)<ref>Tazawa 1981, 347</ref>\n* [[Art name]]s (\u53f7 - ''g\u014d''): Utagawa Toyokuni (\u6b4c\u5ddd\u8c4a\u56fd), Utagawa Ichiy\u014dsai (\u6b4c\u5ddd \u4e00\u967d\u658e), Ichiy\u014dsai Toyokuni (\u4e00\u967d\u658e \u8c4a\u56fd)<ref>ULAN 2004</ref>\n* [[dharma name|Posthumous Buddhist name]] (\u6212\u540d - ''kaimy\u014d'' / \u6cd5\u540d - ''h\u014dmy\u014d''): Tokumy\u014din Jissaireig\u014d Shinji<ref>Marks 2010, 96</ref>\n\nIn addition, the name 'Toyokuni' has been transcribed through several [[kanji]] character combinations, both by the artist himself and by those writing about him.\n\n* Characters used to write Toyokuni: \u8c4a\u56fd, \u8c4a\u570b, \u8c4a\u5700, \u8c50\u570b, \u8c50\u5700<ref>ULAN 2004</ref>  \nToday, Toyokuni is almost universally written using the characters \u8c4a\u56fd. Each of the other kanji are no longer in common usage.\n\n==Pupils==\n[[Image:ToyokuniPorter.jpg|thumb|Matsumoto Koshiro V; circa 1800s]]\n\nToyokuni's two major pupils were the woodblock print masters [[Kunisada]] and [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]], but he had a host of students in his school. Indeed, so powerful was the Utagawa school after Toyokuni's time that almost every Japanese print artist of note either had one of these two characters in his ''g\u014d'', or, like [[Yoshitoshi]], was a student of one who did.<ref>Chiappa 2013</ref>\n\nHis ''g\u014d'', \"Toyokuni\", was initially used after his death by his son-in-law, [[Toyoshige]], who is therefore known to us as Toyokuni II. Thereafter, it was handed down and used by each head of the [[Utagawa school]] in turn. Kunisada is thus also known as [[Toyokuni III]].<ref>From his accession to the name Toyokuni in 1844, Kunisada consistently signed his works Toyokuni II, refusing to accept the legitimacy of his predecessor, Toyokuni II. He is, however, always referred to as Toyokuni III (Marks 2010, 120).</ref>\n\n==Retrospective observations==\n\nEvaluations of him as an artist are somewhat mixed. Indeed, he himself is reported to have once said:\n\n: \"My pictures \u2013 they are merely something that I draw, and nothing more than that!\"<ref>Newland 2005, 502</ref>\n\nThe main criticisms of his works relate to his \"predominantly imitative\" style,<ref>Lane 1978, 151</ref> and to the \"marked decline\" in the quality of works from later in his career.<ref>Waterhouse 1975, 200</ref> However, Toyokuni's style is admired for characteristics such as \"decorative bombast\",{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>Lane 1978, 152</ref> and \"bold, taut designs\".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>Newland 2005, 502</ref> He is also credited with such innovations as diptych, triptych and polytych formats,<ref>Percival 1978, 32</ref> and with training future masters of ukiyo-e.<ref>Tazawa 1981, 346</ref> His work captured the world around him, particularly the kabuki theatre, with great clarity, and his style was a step forward. In addition, it was commercially successful, and thus freed woodblock prints from many of the restrictive canons which had limited previous generations of artists.\n\n==Print series==\nHere is a '''very''' incomplete list of his print series, with dates:\n* ''Views of Actors on Stage'' (ca. 1793)\n* ''Sketches of Seven Elegant Paragons of Beauty'' (ca. 1800)\n* ''Views of Elegant Geisha in Characteristic Poses'' (ca. 1801)\n* ''Tomimoto the Geisha'' (ca. 1830-1844)\n\n==Collections and museums==\n* [[Udinotti Museum of Figurative Art]]\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nImage:UtagawaToyokuniLoveSuicideKabukiWoodcutCA1800.jpg|Kabuki actors, ca. 1800\nFile:Kinokuniya.jpg|Kinokuniya Sawamura Sojuro III as Ogishi Kurando, 1794\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Utagawa school members]]\n* [[Ichikawa Omez\u014d as a Pilgrim and Ichikawa Yaoz\u014d as a Samurai (Toyokuni I)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Sadao Kikuchi, (translated Roy Andrew Miller), ''Utagawa Toyokuni (1769-1825)'' (Charles E.
