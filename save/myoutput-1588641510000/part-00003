[[China|People's Republic of China]], located in [[Northeast China|the northeast]] of the country. The province is bordered by [[Jilin]] to the south and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the west. It also [[China\u2013Russia border|shares a border]] with [[Russia]] ([[Amur Oblast]], [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], [[Khabarovsk Krai]], [[Primorsky Krai]] and [[Zabaykalsky Krai]]) to the north and east. The capital and the largest city of the province is [[Harbin]]. Among Chinese provincial-level [[Administrative divisions of China|administrative divisions]], Heilongjiang is the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by area|sixth-largest by total area]] and the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|15th-most populous]].\n\nThe province takes its name from the [[Heilong River]] (Chinese name of the Amur), which marks   [[China\u2013Russia border|the border]] between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Russia]]. Heilongjiang contains China's northernmost point (in [[Mohe City]] along the Amur) and easternmost point (at the junction of the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] rivers).\n\nHeilongjiang has significant agricultural production,<ref name=\"Stratfor\">{{cite web\n |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/heilongjiang-and-chinas-food-security\n |title=Heilongjiang and China's Food Security\n |date=2012-03-05\n |publisher=Stratfor\n |access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> and raw materials, such as timber, oil and coal.\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Heilongjiang\" literally means [[Black]] [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] [[River]], which is the Chinese name for the more well known western name, [[Amur river|Amur]]. The one-character abbreviation is {{linktext|lang=zh|\u9ed1}} ({{zh|p=H\u0113i}}). The [[Manchu language|Manchu]] name of the region is ''Sahaliyan ula'' (literally, \"Black River\"), from which the name of [[Sakhalin]] is derived, and the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] name with the same meaning is ''Qaram\u00f6rin''. It is sometimes spelt \"Heilungkiang\", especially in older English texts.\n\n==History==\n{{History of the Priamurye region}}\n[[File:Saint Sofia Church.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Sofia Church]]\n\nAncient Chinese records and other sources state that Heilongjiang was inhabited by people such as the [[Sushen people|Sushen]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], [[Balhae]], and the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]. [[Mongol]]ic [[Donghu people]] lived in [[Inner Mongolia]] and the western part of Heilongjiang.<ref>[http://www.orientaldiscovery.com/html/2011/11/201111231554001713.html Origins of Minority Ethnic Groups in Heilongjiang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322043037/http://www.orientaldiscovery.com/html/2011/11/201111231554001713.html |date=2014-03-22 }}</ref>  Some names are Manchu or Mongolian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iqh.net.cn/lsdl_dmx_show.asp?column_id=2506&column_cat_id=469 |script-title=zh:\u6d45\u8c08\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7701\u5730\u540d\u7684\u7279\u70b9 |website=iqh.net.cn |language=zh-cn}}</ref> The eastern portion of Heilongjiang was ruled by the kingdom of [[Balhae]] between the 7th and 10th centuries.

The eastern part of what's today Heilongjiang remained under the supervision of the General of Jilin (Girin i Jiyanggiy\u016bn), whose power reached the [[East Sea of Korea]]. These areas deep in [[Manchuria]] were closed off to [[Han Chinese]] migration.\n \n[[File:\u9547\u5b88\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7b49\u5904\u5730\u65b9\u5c06\u519b\u5370\uff0c\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u5c06\u519b\u5e9c.jpg|thumb|The seal of Heilongjiang General]]\nThe original seat of the Military Governor of Heilongjiang, as established in 1683, was in Heilongjiang City (also known as [[Aigun]] or [[Heihe]], or, in [[Manchu language|Manchu]], Saghalien Ula), located on the Amur River. However, already in 1690 the seat of the governor was transferred to [[Nenjiang County|Nenjiang]] (Mergen) on the [[Nen River]], and, in 1699, further south to [[Qiqihar]]. According to modern historians, the moves may have been driven by supply considerations:  Nenjiang and Qiqihar are connected by a convenient waterway (Nen River) with southern Manchuria, whereas accessing Aigun (Heihe) would require either sailing all the way down the [[Sungari River]] until its confluence with the Amur and then up the Amur to Heihe, or using a [[portage]] over the Lesser Xing'an Mountains between the Nen River valley and the Amur valley. An additional advantage of Qiqihar may have been its location at the junction of a northbound road (to Nenjiang) and a westbound one (to Mongolia), enabling its garrison to defend both against the Russians and the \u00d6l\u00f6t [[Mongols]].<ref>Edmonds (1985), pp. 115\u2013117</ref>\n\nLittle Qing Military presence existed north of Aigun. According to the 18th- and early-20th-century European sources, and the reports of the Russians in the 1850s, the farthest Qing \"advance guard\" post was at Ulusu-Modon (Ulussu-Mudan) ({{zh|\u4e4c\u9c81\u82cf\u7a46\u4e39}}), near the Amur River's famous S-shaped meander. (The post was actually on the left bank of the river, lost to the Russians in 1860.)\n\nIn 1858 and 1860, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government was [[Amur Acquisition|forced to give up]] all land beyond the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] Rivers to the [[Russian Empire]], cutting off the Qing Empire from the [[Sea of Japan]] and giving Heilongjiang its present northern and eastern borders. At the same time, [[Manchuria]] was opened to [[Han Chinese]] migration by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government. By the early twentieth century, due to the ''[[Chuang Guandong]]'', the [[Han Chinese]] had become the dominant ethnic group in the region.<ref>Patrick Fuliang Shan, \"Taming China's Wilderness: Immigration, Settlement, and the Shaping of the Heilongjiang Frontier, 1900\u20131931\", Ashgate, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4094-6389-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded]] Heilongjiang. In 1932, the Japanese completed their conquest of the province, which became part of the [[Japan]]ese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].\n\nIn 1945, Japanese forces in Manchuria were [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|defeated by the Soviet Army]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], Soviet forces aided the Chinese communists. Heilongjiang became the first province to be completely controlled by the communists and [[Harbin]] the first major city to be controlled by them.\n\nAt the beginning of communist rule, Heilongjiang included only the western portion of the present-day province, and had its capital at Qiqihar. The remaining area was the [[Songjiang Province|province of Songjiang]]; its capital was Harbin. In 1954, these two provinces were merged into present-day Heilongjiang. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Heilongjiang was also expanded to include [[Hulunbuir League]] and some other areas previously in [[Inner Mongolia]]; this has since mostly been reversed.\n[[File:Jixi Xingguo Middle Road.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Jixi]]]]\n\n==Geography==\nHeilongjiang is a land of varied topography. Much of the province is dominated by mountain ranges such as the [[Greater Khingan]] Range and [[Lesser Khingan]] Range, [[Zhangguangcai Mountains]], [[Laoye Mountains]], and [[Wanda Mountains]]. The highest peak is [[Mount Datudingzi]] at {{convert|1690|m}}, located on the border with [[Jilin]] province. The Greater Khingan Range contains China's largest remaining virgin forest and is an important area for China's forestry industry.\n\nThe east and southwest of the province, which are relatively flat and low in altitude, contain the [[Muling River]], the [[Naoli River]], the [[Songhua River]], the [[Nen River]], and the [[Mudan River]], all tributaries of the [[Amur River|Amur]], while the northern border forms part of the [[Amur River|Amur]] valley. [[Xingkai Lake]] (or [[Khanka Lake]]) is found on the border with [[Russia]]'s [[Primorsky Krai]].\n\n===Climate===\n\nA [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dwa'' or ''Dwb'') predominates in the province, though areas in the far north are [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] (K\u00f6ppen ''Dwc'').<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Asia_Koppen_Map.png Updated Asian map of the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system]</ref> Winters are long and bitter, with an average of {{convert|\u221231|to|\u221215|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} in January, and summers are short and warm to very warm with an average of {{convert|18|to|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}} in July. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|400|to|700|mm|in|0}}, concentrated heavily in summer.

Industry is focused upon coal, petroleum, lumber, machinery, and food. Due to its location, Heilongjiang is also an important gateway for trade with [[Russia]]. Since a wave of privatization led to the closure of uncompetitive factories in the 1990s, Manchuria has suffered from stagnation. As a result, the government has started the [[Northeast Area Revitalization Plan|Revitalize Northeast China]] campaign to deal with this problem, promoting the private sectors as the preferred method of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]].\n\nAt least five miners were killed after a coal mine fire in Heilongjiang it was reported on 21 September 2008.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/09/21/china.mine.ap/index.html \"50 dead in Chinese mining accidents\"].

The value of the private economy reached RMB234 billion in 2006 and accounted for 37.6 percent of the GDP. In that year, the tax revenue from private enterprises hit RMB20.5 billion.\n\nPrivate enterprises in Heilongjiang led the overall economic growth of the province. Many leading private enterprises have begun to emerge. The province's three major private enterprises, namely the Heilongjiang Sunflower Medicine Ltd, Qitaihe Yidaxin Coal Co., and Heilongjiang Yiyang Group, each contributed more than RMB100 million in [[tax revenue]] in 2007.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nDuring the first decade of this century, many private investors were involved in large construction projects in Heilongjiang. In 2006, 928 large projects absorbed private capital of RMB5 million each, and 101 projects attracted RMB100 million each within the province. In line with the central government's policy to revitalize the Northeast, Heilongjiang also restructured its six pillar industries, namely equipment manufacturing, petrochemicals, food processing, energy, pharmaceuticals, and [[forest]] and [[timber processing]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 2017, Heilongjiang's nominal GDP was 1.62 trillion yuan (ca.

[[China|People's Republic of China]], located in [[Northeast China|the northeast]] of the country. The province is bordered by [[Jilin]] to the south and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the west. It also [[China\u2013Russia border|shares a border]] with [[Russia]] ([[Amur Oblast]], [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], [[Khabarovsk Krai]], [[Primorsky Krai]] and [[Zabaykalsky Krai]]) to the north and east.

Among Chinese provincial-level [[Administrative divisions of China|administrative divisions]], Heilongjiang is the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by area|sixth-largest by total area]] and the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|15th-most populous]].\n\nThe province takes its name from the [[Heilong River]] (Chinese name of the Amur), which marks   [[China\u2013Russia border|the border]] between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Russia]]. Heilongjiang contains China's northernmost point (in [[Mohe City]] along the Amur) and easternmost point (at the junction of the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] rivers).\n\nHeilongjiang has significant agricultural production,<ref name=\"Stratfor\">{{cite web\n |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/heilongjiang-and-chinas-food-security\n |title=Heilongjiang and China's Food Security\n |date=2012-03-05\n |publisher=Stratfor\n |access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> and raw materials, such as timber, oil and coal.\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Heilongjiang\" literally means [[Black]] [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] [[River]], which is the Chinese name for the more well known western name, [[Amur river|Amur]]. The one-character abbreviation is {{linktext|lang=zh|\u9ed1}} ({{zh|p=H\u0113i}}). The [[Manchu language|Manchu]] name of the region is ''Sahaliyan ula'' (literally, \"Black River\"), from which the name of [[Sakhalin]] is derived, and the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] name with the same meaning is ''Qaram\u00f6rin''. It is sometimes spelt \"Heilungkiang\", especially in older English texts.\n\n==History==\n{{History of the Priamurye region}}\n[[File:Saint Sofia Church.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Sofia Church]]\n\nAncient Chinese records and other sources state that Heilongjiang was inhabited by people such as the [[Sushen people|Sushen]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], [[Balhae]], and the [[Khitan people|Khitan]].

The eastern part of what's today Heilongjiang remained under the supervision of the General of Jilin (Girin i Jiyanggiy\u016bn), whose power reached the [[East Sea of Korea]]. These areas deep in [[Manchuria]] were closed off to [[Han Chinese]] migration.\n \n[[File:\u9547\u5b88\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7b49\u5904\u5730\u65b9\u5c06\u519b\u5370\uff0c\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u5c06\u519b\u5e9c.jpg|thumb|The seal of Heilongjiang General]]\nThe original seat of the Military Governor of Heilongjiang, as established in 1683, was in Heilongjiang City (also known as [[Aigun]] or [[Heihe]], or, in [[Manchu language|Manchu]], Saghalien Ula), located on the Amur River. However, already in 1690 the seat of the governor was transferred to [[Nenjiang County|Nenjiang]] (Mergen) on the [[Nen River]], and, in 1699, further south to [[Qiqihar]]. According to modern historians, the moves may have been driven by supply considerations:  Nenjiang and Qiqihar are connected by a convenient waterway (Nen River) with southern Manchuria, whereas accessing Aigun (Heihe) would require either sailing all the way down the [[Sungari River]] until its confluence with the Amur and then up the Amur to Heihe, or using a [[portage]] over the Lesser Xing'an Mountains between the Nen River valley and the Amur valley. An additional advantage of Qiqihar may have been its location at the junction of a northbound road (to Nenjiang) and a westbound one (to Mongolia), enabling its garrison to defend both against the Russians and the \u00d6l\u00f6t [[Mongols]].<ref>Edmonds (1985), pp. 115\u2013117</ref>\n\nLittle Qing Military presence existed north of Aigun. According to the 18th- and early-20th-century European sources, and the reports of the Russians in the 1850s, the farthest Qing \"advance guard\" post was at Ulusu-Modon (Ulussu-Mudan) ({{zh|\u4e4c\u9c81\u82cf\u7a46\u4e39}}), near the Amur River's famous S-shaped meander. (The post was actually on the left bank of the river, lost to the Russians in 1860.)\n\nIn 1858 and 1860, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government was [[Amur Acquisition|forced to give up]] all land beyond the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] Rivers to the [[Russian Empire]], cutting off the Qing Empire from the [[Sea of Japan]] and giving Heilongjiang its present northern and eastern borders. At the same time, [[Manchuria]] was opened to [[Han Chinese]] migration by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government. By the early twentieth century, due to the ''[[Chuang Guandong]]'', the [[Han Chinese]] had become the dominant ethnic group in the region.<ref>Patrick Fuliang Shan, \"Taming China's Wilderness: Immigration, Settlement, and the Shaping of the Heilongjiang Frontier, 1900\u20131931\", Ashgate, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4094-6389-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded]] Heilongjiang. In 1932, the Japanese completed their conquest of the province, which became part of the [[Japan]]ese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].\n\nIn 1945, Japanese forces in Manchuria were [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|defeated by the Soviet Army]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], Soviet forces aided the Chinese communists. Heilongjiang became the first province to be completely controlled by the communists and [[Harbin]] the first major city to be controlled by them.\n\nAt the beginning of communist rule, Heilongjiang included only the western portion of the present-day province, and had its capital at Qiqihar. The remaining area was the [[Songjiang Province|province of Songjiang]]; its capital was Harbin. In 1954, these two provinces were merged into present-day Heilongjiang. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Heilongjiang was also expanded to include [[Hulunbuir League]] and some other areas previously in [[Inner Mongolia]]; this has since mostly been reversed.\n[[File:Jixi Xingguo Middle Road.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Jixi]]]]\n\n==Geography==\nHeilongjiang is a land of varied topography. Much of the province is dominated by mountain ranges such as the [[Greater Khingan]] Range and [[Lesser Khingan]] Range, [[Zhangguangcai Mountains]], [[Laoye Mountains]], and [[Wanda Mountains]].

In 2006, 928 large projects absorbed private capital of RMB5 million each, and 101 projects attracted RMB100 million each within the province. In line with the central government's policy to revitalize the Northeast, Heilongjiang also restructured its six pillar industries, namely equipment manufacturing, petrochemicals, food processing, energy, pharmaceuticals, and [[forest]] and [[timber processing]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn 2017, Heilongjiang's nominal GDP was 1.62 trillion yuan (ca.
