Graz employed the creative staff, wrote and designed each episode, and drew the storyboards. The voice work was done using Canadian studios and South Korean studio AKOM was hired to animate the episodes. ''X-Men'' was originally to premiere over the Labor Day weekend in September; due to production delays, it was pushed to the end of October. When the animation team [[AKOM]] turned in the first episode, it contained hundreds of animation errors, which AKOM refused to fix.

Television was satirized in the episodes \"[[Mojovision]]\" and \"[[Longshot (X-Men episode)|Longshot]]\".\n\n''X-Men'' crossed over with the animated series ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', when Spider-Man seeks out the X-Men's help to stave off his progressing mutation. In the [[Secret Wars (Spider-Man)|abbreviated form]] of the Secret Wars storyline, the [[Beyonder]] and [[Madame Web]] selected Spider-Man to lead a team of heroes including Storm against a group of villains. An earlier draft of \"Secret Wars\" involved all of the X-Men, but transporting the voice cast from Canada to Los Angeles, where production for the ''Spider-Man'' animated series was based, had been too costly in previous crossovers, so the episode was re-written to include only Storm, whose actress, Iona Morris, lived in Los Angeles. [[Hulk]] and [[She-Hulk]] were excluded from the episodes because{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} the ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series featuring the characters was airing on rival network [[UPN]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Stan Lee: Comic Guru|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.4/awm2.4pages/2.4goldmanlee.html|work=Animation World Magazine|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first season of the show brought the X-Men into conflict with human conspirators building mutant-exterminating [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots, Magneto and his attempts to instigate a human-mutant war, and the powerful mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s plans to eradicate the weak, both human and mutant alike. Other storylines including X-Men member Morph's death at the hands of Sentinels, Beast's incarceration, and an assassination attempt on US senator Kelly by Apocalypse's minions to turn human sentiment against the mutants.\n\nThe second season sees Cyclops and Jean get married and become the targets of Mister Sinister, who hopes to use the genetically perfect combination of their DNA to create an army of obedient mutants. Morph returns, having been rescued by Sinister and brainwashed into forcing the X-Men apart. The season also features the growing rift between humans and mutants, spearheaded by the Friends of Humanity, an anti-mutant group who lead the persecution of all mutants. Apocalypse also returns, developing a deadly plague to be blamed on mutants, fueling mutant hatred. A parallel narrative of Professor X and Magneto being lost in the Savage Land runs throughout this season.\n\nThe third season focuses on the cosmic force, the Phoenix, which merges with Jean Grey and eventually turns her into the malevolent and powerful Dark Phoenix. The season also introduced the Shi'ar Empire who want to stop the Dark Phoenix, including Lilandra and Gladiator. Other storylines include the introduction of Wolverine's former lover turned mercenary, Lady Deathstrike, former X-Men member Iceman, and the villainous Shadow King.\n\n===Adaptations===\nAlthough the majority of series's stories are original, a number of storylines and events from the comics are loosely adapted in the series, such as:\n\n====Season 1====\n* The 2-part Pilot episode \"[[Night of the Sentinels]]\" features \"The Mutant Registration Act\" which was first used in \"Days of Future Past\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #141 (January, 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Also the battle at the shopping mall is adapted from Jubilee's first appearance in the story \"Ladies' Night\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #244 (May, 1989) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]]. In that story, Jubilee is attacked by the M-Squad and is rescued by female X-Men and the final sequence wherein Jubilee arrives at the X-Mansion is based on a similar sequence when Kitty Pryde first arrived at the X-Mansion following the funeral for Phoenix in \"Elegy\" from ''X-Men'' #138 (October, 1980) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].\n* The episode, \"[[Enter Magneto]]\", features a confrontation at a missile base: this is largely based on the X-Men's first battle with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], as told in their [[1963 in comics|1963]] debut story \"X-Men\" in ''X-Men #1'' (September, 1963) by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].\n* \"[[Captive Hearts (X-Men)|Captive Hearts]]\" is loosely based on events depicted in \"Catacombs\" and \"Dancin' in the Dark\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #169-170 (May\u2013June, 1983) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], except that the X-Man kidnapped by The Morlocks in those stories was Angel, rather than Cyclops.\n* In the episode \"[[Slave Island (X-Men)|Slave Island]]\", Genosha's treatment of mutants as slave labour is adapted from \"Welcome to Genosha\"/\"Busting Loose\"/\"Who's Human?\"/\"Gonna be a Revolution\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #235-#238 (October\u2013November, 1989) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artists [[Rick Leonardi]] and [[Marc Silvestri]]. However, the premise of how the Genoshan's enslaved mutants is greatly retooled, likely to be more appropriate for children's television.\n* In the episode \"The Unstoppable Juggernaut\", The Juggernaut's origins is adapted from the story \"The Origin of Professor X!\" in ''X-Men'' #12 (July, 1965) by Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Alex Toth]]. Also, the X-Men clashing with Juggernaut at the bank is adapted loosely from the story \"Juggernaut's Back in Town\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #194 by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]], particularly the portions where the X-Men are staking out the bank before the Juggernaut attacks and the origin of Colossus is adapted from ''Deadly Genesis!'' in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May, 1975) by Writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]].\n* \"[[The Cure (X-Men)|The Cure]]\" features a flashback to Rogue's origins detailing her kiss with Cody Robbins, which is adapted from \"Public Enemy\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #185 (September, 1984) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]].\n* Apocalypse's creation of his Four Horsemen in \"[[Come the Apocalypse]]\" is very loosely adapted from Issues #10 \"Falling Angel!\", #12 \"Boom Boom Boom!\", #15 \"Whose Death is it, Anyway?\", #19 \"All Together Now!\" and #24 \"Masks\" from ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' by writer [[Louise Simonson]] artists [[Walter Simonson]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].\n* The first part of the 2-part episode story \"[[Days of Future Past (TV episodes)|Days of Future Past]]\" is loosely based on ''X-Men'' #141 (January, 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the first part of the \"Days of Future Past\" story arc. The entire story was retooled to fit the continuity established in the animated series, however some original elements remained such as Wolverine leading a resistance against the Sentinels. However Bishop's role as a tracker of Mutant rebels is reminiscent of Rachel Summer's role as a Hound, likely adapted from Uncanny X-Men #189. Similarly, Bishop's betrayal of the Sentinels and travel back in time is adapted from Kate Pryde's similar stunt in ''X-Men''' #141 (January, 1981) by [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Nimrod's appearance and battle with the X-Men is likely adapted from \"Raiders of the Lost Temple!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #191 (March, 1985) and 194 (June, 1985) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]]. Also, Bishops' assertion that Gambit betrayed the X-Men is adapted from \"Bishop to King's Five!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #287 (April, 1992) by writers [[Jim Lee]], [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]], wherein Bishop's future the X-Men were apparently killed by one of their own, and as Gambit was the only survivor Bishop long suspected him of betraying the X-Men.\n* The second part of \"[[Days of Future Past (TV episodes)|Days of Future Past]]\" is adapted from \"Mind Out of Time\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #142 (February, 1981) by [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], wherein the X-Men prevent the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants from assassinating Senator Robert Edward Kelly. The story was altered to fit the continuity of the animated series, wherein Bishop takes the place of Kate Pryde, however it deviates from the original story when Magneto abducts Kelly.\n* The entire Sentinel plot from the episode \"[[The Final Decision]]\", including Master Mold forcing Trask to do his bidding is adapted from \"Among Us Stalk... the Sentinels\"/\"Prisoners of the Mysterious Master Mold!\"/\"The Supreme Sacrifice!\" in X-Men #14-16 (November, 1965\u2013January, 1966) by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Werner Roth (comics)|Jay Gavin]]. Whilst Scott's marriage proposal to Jean and Mister Sinister's interest, which is explored fully in Season 2, is very loosely adapted on \"Inferno, Part the Fourth: Ashes!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #243 (April, 1989) by [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]], among other issues where Sinister manipulated Scott's marriage to Madelyne Pryor for his own twisted ends.\n\n====Season 2====\n* The episode \"[[Whatever It Takes (X-Men)|Whatever It Takes]]\" features a flashback depicting Mjnari's birth is based on the story \"Life-Death II\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #198 (October, 1985). In that story, Storm discovered Shani's tribe after losing her mutant powers, and resuscitated Shani's (unnamed) son as in this episode. The story also featured a tribal elder named MjNari, who chose to die when Shani's son was born, so that the tribe would not become too numerous for its resources.\n* The episode \"Repo Man\" is based on \"Shoot-Out at the Stampede!\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #121 (May, 1979), and the \"\"[[Weapon X (story arc)|Weapon X]]\" story from ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #72-84 (March\u2013September 1991).\n* The episode \"X-Ternally Yours\" is based upon the \"Gambit\" 4 issue mini-series featuring \"Tithing\"/\"Honor Amongst Thieves\"/\"The Benefactress\"/\"Thief of Time\" (which was published literally around the same time that episode first aired) (December, 1993\u2013March, 1994) though in it Gambit's brother is named Henri instead of Bobby.\n* In \"Time Fugitives (parts 1 & 2)\" features a variation of the \"[[Legacy Virus]]\" story line where it was the creation of Apocalypse, who had created the virus with the aid of Graydon Creed and the Friends of Humanity, infecting innocent people and claiming that mutants were the ones who had caused the plague. In an attempt to stop the plague, Bishop came back from the future to destroy Apocalypse's work before the virus could move on to mutants, but as a result vital antibodies that would allow the mutant race to survive future plagues were never created. Traveling back from even further in the future, Cable was able to come up with a compromise that allowed both Bishop's and his own missions to succeed; although the plague never made the jump to mutants on a large-scale basis, Cable nevertheless ensured that Wolverine would be infected, thus creating the necessary antibodies while not killing any mutants thanks to Wolverine's healing factor.\n* Parts of the episode \"A Rogue's Tale\" are based on \"Rogue Redux\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #269 (October, 1990) and \"By Friends \u2013 Betrayed!\" in ''Avengers Annual'' #10 (August, 1981).\n\n====Season 3====\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 1): Sacrifice\" is loosely based on \"My Brother, My Enemy!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #97 (February, 1976), \"Deathstar, Rising!\"/\"Greater Love Hath No X-Man...\"/\"Phoenix Unleashed!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #90-100  (June\u2013August 1976).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 2): The Dark Shroud\" is loosely based on \"Like a Phoenix, from the Ashes\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #101 (October, 1976) and \"Dark Shroud of the Past!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #106 (August, 1977).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Cry of the Banshee\" is loosely based on \"Who Will Stop the Juggernaut?\"/\"The Fall of the Tower\"/\"The Gentleman's Name is Magneto\" in Uncanny X-Men #102-105 (December, 1976-June, 1977).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 4): The Starjammers\" is loosely based on \"Where No X-Man Has Gone Before!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #107 (October, 1977).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 5): Child of Light\" is loosely based on \"Armageddon Now\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #108 (December, 1977).\n* \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]] (Part 1): Dazzled\" is both based heavily and loosely on different areas, of the story lines \"Dazzler\"/\"Run for Your Life!\"/ \"And Hellfire is Their Name!\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #130-132 (February\u2013April, 1980).\n* \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 2): The Inner Circle\" is based on \"Wolverine: Alone!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #133 (May, 1980) & \"Too Late, the Heroes!\" in #134 ''Uncanny X-Men'' (June, 1980). The battle with the Inner Circle follows the original comics very closely, with Beast taking the role of Nightcrawler (when juggling Shaw), and Rogue taking the role of Colossus (tearing the arm off Pierce).\n* \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Dark Phoenix\" is based on \"Dark Phoenix\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #135 (July, 1980) and \"Child of Light and Darkness!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #136 (August, 1980).\n* \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 4): The Fate of the Phoenix\" is based on the comic of the same name (\"The Fate of the Phoenix!\") in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137 (September, 1980).\n* The episode \"Orphan's End\" is based on \"Reunion\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #154 and \"First Blood\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #155.\n* \"Sanctuary (Part 1)\" is loosely based on \"Rubicon\" in ''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #1 (October, 1991) and \"Firestorm\" in ''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #2 (November, 1991) from the ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' series and the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] storyline.\n* \"Sanctuary (Part 2)\" is loosely based on \"Fallout!\" ''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #3 (December, 1991) from the ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' series and the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] storyline.\n\n====Season 4====\n* The episode \"Weapon X, Lies, & Videotape\" is loosely based on the story-lines \"The Shiva Scenario Part 1: Dreams of Gore, Phase 1\"/\"Shiva Scenario Part 2: Dreams of Gore: Phase Two\"/\"The Shiva Scenario Part 3: Dreams of Gore: Phase 3\" from Wolverine #48\u201350 (November, 1992-January 1993), with a bit of the story-lines \"Nightmare Quest!\"/\"Reunion!\"/\"Bastions of Glory!\"/\"What Goes Around...\" from issues #61-64 (September\u2013December 1992) thrown in, as well (though the robot Talos is called \"Shiva\" there, and the Weapon X project has more members).\n\n====Season 5====\n* The 2-part final season opener \"Phalanx Covenant\" was adapted from the comic [[Phalanx Covenant|of the same name]] (September\u2013October 1994) with Beast as the central character. The Phalanx were conceived to be fully alien and not mutant hating humans who were infected with the technology, becoming more like the Technarchy, with Cameron Hodge working along with them serving much the same role as in the comics. During the two parter, Beast teams up with Warlock, Forge (part of X-Factor), Mr Sinister, Amelia Voght (who was working on Muir Island at the time) and Magneto.\n* The episode \"Jubilee's Fairytale Theater\" is based on \"Kitty's Fairy Tale\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #153 (January, 1982). Where [[Kitty Pryde]] told a fairytale to [[Illyana Rasputina]], replacing Kitty Pryde with Jubilee and Illyana Rasputina with school children.\n* The episode \"Old Soldiers\" is loosely based on \"Madripoor Knights\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #268 (September, 1990). It tells the tale of Logan, while acting as a special operative for Canada, teaming up with [[Captain America]] and the [[Howling Commandos]] during World War II to rescue someone who had been captured by [[Red Skull]]. Logan would use detachable metal claws to scale the side of a mountain and then comment how he liked them.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of X-Men (TV series) characters}}\n\nThe series' voice acting was recorded in Toronto studios, with Dan Hennessey serving as voice director. Toronto voice actors had been already used for the 1960s Marvel Comics cartoons.\n\n===Principal cast===\n* [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops / Scott Summers]] ([[Norm Spencer]]): The second-in-command and field commander of the X-Men. He possesses the ability to fire concussive blasts from his eyes.  He and Jean Grey are in a longstanding relationship, and marry at the end of season four when Apocalypse is working in between the time space continuum.\n* [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine / Logan]] ([[Cathal J. Dodd]]): A mutant with a regenerative healing factor, heightened senses, an adamantium-laced skeleton that render his bones virtually indestructible, and retractable claws capable of cutting virtually anything. He was attracted to Jean Grey, but decided not to come against Scott Summers.\n* [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] ([[Lenore Zann]]): She possesses the uncontrollable ability to absorb the memories, powers and energy of those she touches; however, if Rogue holds onto someone too long, their consciousness will be trapped in her subconscious.  She has permanently absorbed the superhuman strength, durability and flight of [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] who was left comatose due to this.\n* [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm / Ororo Munroe]] ([[Iona Morris]] (1992\u20131993), [[Alison Sealy-Smith]] (1993\u20131997)): She is able to control the weather, using it to injure her foes or fly and is third in command of the X-Men. Storm has to remain in constant control of her emotions, as they are linked to her powers; if she let loose, she would call horrific weather conditions that would put lives at jeopardy.\n* [[Beast (comics)|Beast / Dr. Henry \"Hank\" McCoy]] ([[George Buza]]): His mutation covers his body in fur and morphs his body, granting him superhuman strength and agility to complement his genius mind. He spends most of the first season imprisoned for destroying the government's records of registered mutants, which was being abused by Henry Gyrich and Bolivar Trask. Buza would later appear in a small role in the 2000 live action film, playing a truck driver at the start of the film.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n* [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit / Remy LeBeau]] ([[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] (1992\u20131996), [[Tony Daniels]] (1997)): He can charge virtually any object with explosive energy, turning them into bombs; they only explode once he lets go of the object. He also wields a staff for close combat, and for when he's out of playing cards to throw. Potter was cast while filming ''[[Kung Fu: The Legend Continues]]'' in Toronto; unfamiliar with the X-Men, his co-star [[David Carradine]] was a big fan of the comics. Potter later auditioned for the role of Cyclops in the 2000 film.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n* [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee / Jubilation Lee]] ([[Alyson Court]]): The newest and youngest member of the X-Men, she is close to Wolverine. She is still getting used to her powers, which are the ability to generate firework-like explosions. Court and Dodd had been neighbors when Court was still a child and Dodd was already a well-known actor in Canada. Court attributes their characters' chemistry to being previously acquainted with one another. Originally another voice actor had been cast as Jubilee, but Court was cast when the original voice was deemed too sweet and innocent sounding for the role.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n* [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] ([[Catherine Disher]]): A telekinetic and telepath. She is in a longstanding relationship with Cyclops, and they marry at the end of the fourth season, when she is captured by Apocalypse in the time space continuum.

This intro is used throughout the first four seasons. A modified version is eventually introduced in season five, episode one (\"Phalanx Covenant, Part One\"). In this new intro, the beginning of the theme is slightly changed. When [[UPN]] began airing repeats on Sunday mornings an alternate credits sequence was used: a high-quality Japanese-animated version of the original opening. This modified version occasionally appears in the digital streaming release of the show, which was used for re-runs on Toon Disney.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n''X-Men'' originally aired on [[TV Tokyo]] from 1994 through 1995.  For the TV Tokyo dub of the series, the intro was replaced with a new, Japanese-animated sequence as well as a new theme called \"Rising\" (\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0), by the band Ambience (\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9). Starting with episode 42, a second new intro was used, featuring the song \"Dakishimetai Dare Yori Mo\" (\u62b1\u304d\u3057\u3081\u305f\u3044\u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082...). The end credits sequence was also changed: it featured shots of American ''X-Men'' comic books set to the song \"Back to You\" (\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\uff65\u30c8\u30a6\uff65\u30e6\u30fc), also by Ambience.\n\nThe TV Tokyo dub was directed by Yoshikazu Iwanami and featured scripts rewritten to include a more humorous, self-satirical tone as well as an emphasis on comical adlibbing (a hallmark of Iwanami's dubbing style). Episodes were edited for time so that new segments could be added to the end which promoted the ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' video game from [[Capcom]]. The dub actors would pretend to play the game as their characters and make humorous asides and remarks. ''X-Men'' was dubbed a second time in the early 2000s for broadcast on [[Toon Disney|Toon Disney (Japan)]]. This dub was more faithful to the original English scripts and episodes were not cut for time. The Toon Disney version used the original American intro and end credits rather than the unique ones created for the TV Tokyo version.\n\nTwo versions of the episode \"No Mutant is an Island\" exist with completely different animation. The first version was aired for Toon Disney re-runs and can be seen in digital streaming services such as iTunes and Amazon Video and is available on region 1 DVD.  The first version (usually called the Canadian/international version by fans, as it was the original version that was scheduled to air after the \u201cPhoenix Saga\u201d in Season 3, but was not aired by FOX in the US) uses the theme song mix from Seasons 1\u20134, while the second version (called the US Version by fans), which was reanimated, aired in the US on FOX in Season 5 and was on Marvel.com for a while, used the Season 5 remixed theme.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe show was both acclaimed and commercially successful. Along with ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the series success helped launch numerous comic book shows in the 1990s.\n\nIn its prime, ''X-Men'' garnered very high [[Nielsen Ratings|ratings]] for a Saturday morning cartoon, and like ''Batman: The Animated Series'', it received wide critical praise for its portrayal of many different storylines from the comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men - Volume 1 DVD Review|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/975/975959p1.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men - Volume 2 DVD Review|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/975/975974p1.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men Volume Four DVD Review|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/102/1026367p1.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men - Volume 5 DVD Review|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/108/1087564p1.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men, Volume 1|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/37099/x-men-volume-1/|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men, Volume 2|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/37196/marvel-x-men-volume-2/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men, Volume 3|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38480/x-men-the-animated-series-volume-3/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= X-Men, Volume 4|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38481/x-men-the-animated-series-volume-4/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=X-Men - Marvel Comic Book Collection Volume 1 Review|work=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/X-Men-Marvel-Comic-Book-Collection-Volume-1/8520|accessdate=2010-10-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815013821/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/X-Men-Marvel-Comic-Book-Collection-Volume-1/8520|archivedate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=X-Men - Marvel Comic Book Collection Volume 3 Review|work=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/He-Man-Masters-Universe-Box-Art/12161|accessdate=2010-10-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123051837/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/He-Man-Masters-Universe-Box-Art/12161|archivedate=2011-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=X-Men - Marvel Comic Book Collection Volume 4 Review|work=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/X-Men-Marvel-Comic-Book-Collection-Volume-4/9086|accessdate=2010-10-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819040736/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/X-Men-Marvel-Comic-Book-Collection-Volume-4/9086|archivedate=2010-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=X-Men - Marvel Comic Book Collection Volume 5 Review|work=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/X-Men-Marvel-Comic-Book-Collection-Volume-5/9704|accessdate=2009-10-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513071247/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/X-Men-Marvel-Comic-Book-Collection-Volume-5/9704|archivedate=2010-05-13}}</ref> Haim Saban credits the success of the series in assisting him to sell his next project to Fox, the live action series, ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]''.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n\nThe show has been hailed as a pioneer in crafting mature, serialized storylines for an animated series, as well as paving the way for the 2000 X-Men feature film.<ref name=\"HR25\" /> In 2009, [[IGN]] ranked ''X-Men'' as the 13th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.<ref>{{cite web| title = IGN - 13.

An earlier draft of \"Secret Wars\" involved all of the X-Men, but transporting the voice cast from Canada to Los Angeles, where production for the ''Spider-Man'' animated series was based, had been too costly in previous crossovers, so the episode was re-written to include only Storm, whose actress, Iona Morris, lived in Los Angeles. [[Hulk]] and [[She-Hulk]] were excluded from the episodes because{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} the ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series featuring the characters was airing on rival network [[UPN]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Stan Lee: Comic Guru|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.4/awm2.4pages/2.4goldmanlee.html|work=Animation World Magazine|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first season of the show brought the X-Men into conflict with human conspirators building mutant-exterminating [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots, Magneto and his attempts to instigate a human-mutant war, and the powerful mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s plans to eradicate the weak, both human and mutant alike. Other storylines including X-Men member Morph's death at the hands of Sentinels, Beast's incarceration, and an assassination attempt on US senator Kelly by Apocalypse's minions to turn human sentiment against the mutants.\n\nThe second season sees Cyclops and Jean get married and become the targets of Mister Sinister, who hopes to use the genetically perfect combination of their DNA to create an army of obedient mutants. Morph returns, having been rescued by Sinister and brainwashed into forcing the X-Men apart. The season also features the growing rift between humans and mutants, spearheaded by the Friends of Humanity, an anti-mutant group who lead the persecution of all mutants. Apocalypse also returns, developing a deadly plague to be blamed on mutants, fueling mutant hatred. A parallel narrative of Professor X and Magneto being lost in the Savage Land runs throughout this season.\n\nThe third season focuses on the cosmic force, the Phoenix, which merges with Jean Grey and eventually turns her into the malevolent and powerful Dark Phoenix. The season also introduced the Shi'ar Empire who want to stop the Dark Phoenix, including Lilandra and Gladiator. Other storylines include the introduction of Wolverine's former lover turned mercenary, Lady Deathstrike, former X-Men member Iceman, and the villainous Shadow King.\n\n===Adaptations===\nAlthough the majority of series's stories are original, a number of storylines and events from the comics are loosely adapted in the series, such as:\n\n====Season 1====\n* The 2-part Pilot episode \"[[Night of the Sentinels]]\" features \"The Mutant Registration Act\" which was first used in \"Days of Future Past\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #141 (January, 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Also the battle at the shopping mall is adapted from Jubilee's first appearance in the story \"Ladies' Night\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #244 (May, 1989) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]]. In that story, Jubilee is attacked by the M-Squad and is rescued by female X-Men and the final sequence wherein Jubilee arrives at the X-Mansion is based on a similar sequence when Kitty Pryde first arrived at the X-Mansion following the funeral for Phoenix in \"Elegy\" from ''X-Men'' #138 (October, 1980) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].\n* The episode, \"[[Enter Magneto]]\", features a confrontation at a missile base: this is largely based on the X-Men's first battle with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], as told in their [[1963 in comics|1963]] debut story \"X-Men\" in ''X-Men #1'' (September, 1963) by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].\n* \"[[Captive Hearts (X-Men)|Captive Hearts]]\" is loosely based on events depicted in \"Catacombs\" and \"Dancin' in the Dark\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #169-170 (May\u2013June, 1983) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], except that the X-Man kidnapped by The Morlocks in those stories was Angel, rather than Cyclops.\n* In the episode \"[[Slave Island (X-Men)|Slave Island]]\", Genosha's treatment of mutants as slave labour is adapted from \"Welcome to Genosha\"/\"Busting Loose\"/\"Who's Human?\"/\"Gonna be a Revolution\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #235-#238 (October\u2013November, 1989) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artists [[Rick Leonardi]] and [[Marc Silvestri]]. However, the premise of how the Genoshan's enslaved mutants is greatly retooled, likely to be more appropriate for children's television.\n* In the episode \"The Unstoppable Juggernaut\", The Juggernaut's origins is adapted from the story \"The Origin of Professor X!\" in ''X-Men'' #12 (July, 1965) by Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Alex Toth]]. Also, the X-Men clashing with Juggernaut at the bank is adapted loosely from the story \"Juggernaut's Back in Town\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #194 by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]], particularly the portions where the X-Men are staking out the bank before the Juggernaut attacks and the origin of Colossus is adapted from ''Deadly Genesis!'' in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May, 1975) by Writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]].\n* \"[[The Cure (X-Men)|The Cure]]\" features a flashback to Rogue's origins detailing her kiss with Cody Robbins, which is adapted from \"Public Enemy\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #185 (September, 1984) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]].\n* Apocalypse's creation of his Four Horsemen in \"[[Come the Apocalypse]]\" is very loosely adapted from Issues #10 \"Falling Angel!\", #12 \"Boom Boom Boom!\", #15 \"Whose Death is it, Anyway?\", #19 \"All Together Now!\" and #24 \"Masks\" from ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' by writer [[Louise Simonson]] artists [[Walter Simonson]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].\n* The first part of the 2-part episode story \"[[Days of Future Past (TV episodes)|Days of Future Past]]\" is loosely based on ''X-Men'' #141 (January, 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the first part of the \"Days of Future Past\" story arc. The entire story was retooled to fit the continuity established in the animated series, however some original elements remained such as Wolverine leading a resistance against the Sentinels. However Bishop's role as a tracker of Mutant rebels is reminiscent of Rachel Summer's role as a Hound, likely adapted from Uncanny X-Men #189. Similarly, Bishop's betrayal of the Sentinels and travel back in time is adapted from Kate Pryde's similar stunt in ''X-Men''' #141 (January, 1981) by [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne]]. Nimrod's appearance and battle with the X-Men is likely adapted from \"Raiders of the Lost Temple!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #191 (March, 1985) and 194 (June, 1985) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]]. Also, Bishops' assertion that Gambit betrayed the X-Men is adapted from \"Bishop to King's Five!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #287 (April, 1992) by writers [[Jim Lee]], [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]], wherein Bishop's future the X-Men were apparently killed by one of their own, and as Gambit was the only survivor Bishop long suspected him of betraying the X-Men.\n* The second part of \"[[Days of Future Past (TV episodes)|Days of Future Past]]\" is adapted from \"Mind Out of Time\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #142 (February, 1981) by [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne]], wherein the X-Men prevent the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants from assassinating Senator Robert Edward Kelly. The story was altered to fit the continuity of the animated series, wherein Bishop takes the place of Kate Pryde, however it deviates from the original story when Magneto abducts Kelly.\n* The entire Sentinel plot from the episode \"[[The Final Decision]]\", including Master Mold forcing Trask to do his bidding is adapted from \"Among Us Stalk... the Sentinels\"/\"Prisoners of the Mysterious Master Mold!\"/\"The Supreme Sacrifice!\" in X-Men #14-16 (November, 1965\u2013January, 1966) by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Werner Roth (comics)|Jay Gavin]]. Whilst Scott's marriage proposal to Jean and Mister Sinister's interest, which is explored fully in Season 2, is very loosely adapted on \"Inferno, Part the Fourth: Ashes!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #243 (April, 1989) by [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]], among other issues where Sinister manipulated Scott's marriage to Madelyne Pryor for his own twisted ends.\n\n====Season 2====\n* The episode \"[[Whatever It Takes (X-Men)|Whatever It Takes]]\" features a flashback depicting Mjnari's birth is based on the story \"Life-Death II\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #198 (October, 1985). In that story, Storm discovered Shani's tribe after losing her mutant powers, and resuscitated Shani's (unnamed) son as in this episode. The story also featured a tribal elder named MjNari, who chose to die when Shani's son was born, so that the tribe would not become too numerous for its resources.\n* The episode \"Repo Man\" is based on \"Shoot-Out at the Stampede!\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #121 (May, 1979), and the \"\"[[Weapon X (story arc)|Weapon X]]\" story from ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #72-84 (March\u2013September 1991).\n* The episode \"X-Ternally Yours\" is based upon the \"Gambit\" 4 issue mini-series featuring \"Tithing\"/\"Honor Amongst Thieves\"/\"The Benefactress\"/\"Thief of Time\" (which was published literally around the same time that episode first aired) (December, 1993\u2013March, 1994) though in it Gambit's brother is named Henri instead of Bobby.\n* In \"Time Fugitives (parts 1 & 2)\" features a variation of the \"[[Legacy Virus]]\" story line where it was the creation of Apocalypse, who had created the virus with the aid of Graydon Creed and the Friends of Humanity, infecting innocent people and claiming that mutants were the ones who had caused the plague. In an attempt to stop the plague, Bishop came back from the future to destroy Apocalypse's work before the virus could move on to mutants, but as a result vital antibodies that would allow the mutant race to survive future plagues were never created. Traveling back from even further in the future, Cable was able to come up with a compromise that allowed both Bishop's and his own missions to succeed; although the plague never made the jump to mutants on a large-scale basis, Cable nevertheless ensured that Wolverine would be infected, thus creating the necessary antibodies while not killing any mutants thanks to Wolverine's healing factor.\n* Parts of the episode \"A Rogue's Tale\" are based on \"Rogue Redux\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #269 (October, 1990) and \"By Friends \u2013 Betrayed!\" in ''Avengers Annual'' #10 (August, 1981).\n\n====Season 3====\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 1): Sacrifice\" is loosely based on \"My Brother, My Enemy!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #97 (February, 1976), \"Deathstar, Rising!\"/\"Greater Love Hath No X-Man...\"/\"Phoenix Unleashed!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #90-100  (June\u2013August 1976).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 2): The Dark Shroud\" is loosely based on \"Like a Phoenix, from the Ashes\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #101 (October, 1976) and \"Dark Shroud of the Past!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #106 (August, 1977).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Cry of the Banshee\" is loosely based on \"Who Will Stop the Juggernaut?\"/\"The Fall of the Tower\"/\"The Gentleman's Name is Magneto\" in Uncanny X-Men #102-105 (December, 1976-June, 1977).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 4): The Starjammers\" is loosely based on \"Where No X-Man Has Gone Before!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #107 (October, 1977).\n* \"The Phoenix Saga (Part 5): Child of Light\" is loosely based on \"Armageddon Now\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #108 (December, 1977).\n* \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]] (Part 1): Dazzled\" is both based heavily and loosely on different areas, of the story lines \"Dazzler\"/\"Run for Your Life!\"/ \"And Hellfire is Their Name!\" from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #130-132 (February\u2013April, 1980).\n* \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 2): The Inner Circle\" is based on \"Wolverine: Alone!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #133 (May, 1980) & \"Too Late, the Heroes!\" in #134 ''Uncanny X-Men'' (June, 1980). The battle with the Inner Circle follows the original comics very closely, with Beast taking the role of Nightcrawler (when juggling Shaw), and Rogue taking the role of Colossus (tearing the arm off Pierce).\n* \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Dark Phoenix\" is based on \"Dark Phoenix\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #135 (July, 1980) and \"Child of Light and Darkness!\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #136 (August, 1980).\n* \"The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 4): The Fate of the Phoenix\" is based on the comic of the same name (\"The Fate of the Phoenix!\") in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137 (September, 1980).\n* The episode \"Orphan's End\" is based on \"Reunion\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #154 and \"First Blood\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #155.\n* \"Sanctuary (Part 1)\" is loosely based on \"Rubicon\" in ''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #1 (October, 1991) and \"Firestorm\" in ''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #2 (November, 1991) from the ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' series and the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] storyline.\n* \"Sanctuary (Part 2)\" is loosely based on \"Fallout!\" ''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #3 (December, 1991) from the ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' series and the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] storyline.\n\n====Season 4====\n* The episode \"Weapon X, Lies, & Videotape\" is loosely based on the story-lines \"The Shiva Scenario Part 1: Dreams of Gore, Phase 1\"/\"Shiva Scenario Part 2: Dreams of Gore: Phase Two\"/\"The Shiva Scenario Part 3: Dreams of Gore: Phase 3\" from Wolverine #48\u201350 (November, 1992-January 1993), with a bit of the story-lines \"Nightmare Quest!\"/\"Reunion!\"/\"Bastions of Glory!\"/\"What Goes Around...\" from issues #61-64 (September\u2013December 1992) thrown in, as well (though the robot Talos is called \"Shiva\" there, and the Weapon X project has more members).\n\n====Season 5====\n* The 2-part final season opener \"Phalanx Covenant\" was adapted from the comic [[Phalanx Covenant|of the same name]] (September\u2013October 1994) with Beast as the central character. The Phalanx were conceived to be fully alien and not mutant hating humans who were infected with the technology, becoming more like the Technarchy, with Cameron Hodge working along with them serving much the same role as in the comics. During the two parter, Beast teams up with Warlock, Forge (part of X-Factor), Mr Sinister, Amelia Voght (who was working on Muir Island at the time) and Magneto.\n* The episode \"Jubilee's Fairytale Theater\" is based on \"Kitty's Fairy Tale\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #153 (January, 1982). Where [[Kitty Pryde]] told a fairytale to [[Illyana Rasputina]], replacing Kitty Pryde with Jubilee and Illyana Rasputina with school children.\n* The episode \"Old Soldiers\" is loosely based on \"Madripoor Knights\" in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #268 (September, 1990). It tells the tale of Logan, while acting as a special operative for Canada, teaming up with [[Captain America]] and the [[Howling Commandos]] during World War II to rescue someone who had been captured by [[Red Skull]]. Logan would use detachable metal claws to scale the side of a mountain and then comment how he liked them.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of X-Men (TV series) characters}}\n\nThe series' voice acting was recorded in Toronto studios, with Dan Hennessey serving as voice director. Toronto voice actors had been already used for the 1960s Marvel Comics cartoons.\n\n===Principal cast===\n* [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops / Scott Summers]] ([[Norm Spencer]]): The second-in-command and field commander of the X-Men. He possesses the ability to fire concussive blasts from his eyes.  He and Jean Grey are in a longstanding relationship, and marry at the end of season four when Apocalypse is working in between the time space continuum.\n* [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine / Logan]] ([[Cathal J. Dodd]]): A mutant with a regenerative healing factor, heightened senses, an adamantium-laced skeleton that render his bones virtually indestructible, and retractable claws capable of cutting virtually anything. He was attracted to Jean Grey, but decided not to come against Scott Summers.\n* [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] ([[Lenore Zann]]): She possesses the uncontrollable ability to absorb the memories, powers and energy of those she touches; however, if Rogue holds onto someone too long, their consciousness will be trapped in her subconscious.  She has permanently absorbed the superhuman strength, durability and flight of [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] who was left comatose due to this.\n* [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm / Ororo Munroe]] ([[Iona Morris]] (1992\u20131993), [[Alison Sealy-Smith]] (1993\u20131997)): She is able to control the weather, using it to injure her foes or fly and is third in command of the X-Men. Storm has to remain in constant control of her emotions, as they are linked to her powers; if she let loose, she would call horrific weather conditions that would put lives at jeopardy.\n* [[Beast (comics)|Beast / Dr. Henry \"Hank\" McCoy]] ([[George Buza]]): His mutation covers his body in fur and morphs his body, granting him superhuman strength and agility to complement his genius mind. He spends most of the first season imprisoned for destroying the government's records of registered mutants, which was being abused by Henry Gyrich and Bolivar Trask. Buza would later appear in a small role in the 2000 live action film, playing a truck driver at the start of the film.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n* [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit / Remy LeBeau]] ([[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] (1992\u20131996), [[Tony Daniels]] (1997)): He can charge virtually any object with explosive energy, turning them into bombs; they only explode once he lets go of the object. He also wields a staff for close combat, and for when he's out of playing cards to throw. Potter was cast while filming ''[[Kung Fu: The Legend Continues]]'' in Toronto; unfamiliar with the X-Men, his co-star [[David Carradine]] was a big fan of the comics. Potter later auditioned for the role of Cyclops in the 2000 film.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n* [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee / Jubilation Lee]] ([[Alyson Court]]): The newest and youngest member of the X-Men, she is close to Wolverine. She is still getting used to her powers, which are the ability to generate firework-like explosions. Court and Dodd had been neighbors when Court was still a child and Dodd was already a well-known actor in Canada. Court attributes their characters' chemistry to being previously acquainted with one another. Originally another voice actor had been cast as Jubilee, but Court was cast when the original voice was deemed too sweet and innocent sounding for the role.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n* [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] ([[Catherine Disher]]): A telekinetic and telepath. She is in a longstanding relationship with Cyclops, and they marry at the end of the fourth season, when she is captured by Apocalypse in the time space continuum. Disher had originally auditioned for the part of Storm.<ref name=\"HR25\" />\n* [[Professor X|Professor X / Charles Xavier]] ([[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]]): The founder and leader of the X-Men and a powerful telepath. Throughout the series, he fights for mutant rights while teaching his students the importance of never giving into temptation or lose sight of what really matters.\n\n===Additional cast===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Phil Aiken]]\n* [[Lawrence Bayne]]\n* [[Rick Bennett]]\n* [[Lally Cadeau]]\n* [[Robert Cait]]\n* [[Randall Carpenter]]\n* [[John Colicoa]]\n* [[Rodney Coneybeare]]\n* [[Jennifer Dale]]\n* [[Cal Dodd]]\n* [[Adrian Egan]]\n* [[Barry Flatman]]\n* [[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]]\n* [[Don Francks]]\n* [[Catherine Gallant]]\n* [[Paul Haddad]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Graham Haley]]\n* [[Brett Halsey]]\n* [[David Hemblen]]\n* [[Dan Hennessey]]\n* [[Judy Marshak]]\n* [[George Merner]]\n* [[Jim Millington]]\n* [[Stephen Ouimette]]\n* [[Ross Petty]]\n* [[Jeremy Ratchford]]\n* [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]]\n* [[Stuart Stone]]\n* [[Marc Strange]]\n* [[Kay Trembley]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Crew==\n* [[Dan Hennessey]] - Voice Director\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|List of X-Men (TV series) video releases}}\nThe original opening sequence featured the X-Men demonstrating their mutant abilities to a now very distinctive instrumental theme (written by [[Ron Wasserman]]). This intro is used throughout the first four seasons. A modified version is eventually introduced in season five, episode one (\"Phalanx Covenant, Part One\"). In this new intro, the beginning of the theme is slightly changed. When [[UPN]] began airing repeats on Sunday mornings an alternate credits sequence was used: a high-quality Japanese-animated version of the original opening. This modified version occasionally appears in the digital streaming release of the show, which was used for re-runs on Toon Disney.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n''X-Men'' originally aired on [[TV Tokyo]] from 1994 through 1995.  For the TV Tokyo dub of the series, the intro was replaced with a new, Japanese-animated sequence as well as a new theme called \"Rising\" (\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0), by the band Ambience (\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9). Starting with episode 42, a second new intro was used, featuring the song \"Dakishimetai Dare Yori Mo\" (\u62b1\u304d\u3057\u3081\u305f\u3044\u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082...). The end credits sequence was also changed: it featured shots of American ''X-Men'' comic books set to the song \"Back to You\" (\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\uff65\u30c8\u30a6\uff65\u30e6\u30fc), also by Ambience.\n\nThe TV Tokyo dub was directed by Yoshikazu Iwanami and featured scripts rewritten to include a more humorous, self-satirical tone as well as an emphasis on comical adlibbing (a hallmark of Iwanami's dubbing style). Episodes were edited for time so that new segments could be added to the end which promoted the ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' video game from [[Capcom]]. The dub actors would pretend to play the game as their characters and make humorous asides and remarks. ''X-Men'' was dubbed a second time in the early 2000s for broadcast on [[Toon Disney|Toon Disney (Japan)]]. This dub was more faithful to the original English scripts and episodes were not cut for time. The Toon Disney version used the original American intro and end credits rather than the unique ones created for the TV Tokyo version.\n\nTwo versions of the episode \"No Mutant is an Island\" exist with completely different animation. The first version was aired for Toon Disney re-runs and can be seen in digital streaming services such as iTunes and Amazon Video and is available on region 1 DVD.
