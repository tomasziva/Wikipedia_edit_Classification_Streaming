On 11 November 1943, this soldier's platoon was furnishing machinegun support for a rifle company attacking a hill near Mignano, Italy, when the enemy counterattacked, forcing the riflemen and half the machinegun platoon to retire to a defensive position. Pfc. Lindstrom saw that his small section was alone and outnumbered 5 to 1, yet he immediately deployed the few remaining men into position and opened fire with his single gun. The enemy centered fire on him with machinegun, [[machine pistol]]s, and grenades. Unable to knock out the enemy nest from his original position, Pfc. Lindstrom picked up his own heavy machinegun and staggered 15 yards up the barren, rocky hillside to a new position, completely ignoring enemy [[small arms]] fire which was striking all around him. From this new site, only 10 yards from the enemy machinegun, he engaged it in an intense duel. Realizing that he could not hit the hostile gunners because they were behind a large rock, he charged uphill under a steady stream of fire, killed both gunners with his pistol and dragged their gun down to his own men, directing them to employ it against the enemy. Disregarding heavy rifle fire, he returned to the enemy machinegun nest for 2 boxes of ammunition, came back and resumed withering fire from his own gun. His spectacular performance completely broke up the German counterattack. Pfc. Lindstrom demonstrated aggressive spirit and complete fearlessness in the face of almost certain death.<ref name=\"ACMH\">{{ACMH}}{{Cite web\n  |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n  |title = Medal of Honor recipients - World War II (G\u2013L)\n  |work = Medal of Honor citations\n  |date = June 8, 2009\n  |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-g-l.html\n  |accessdate = 2008-01-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\n* By a public law dated December 16, 2014, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] community-based outpatient clinic in Colorado Springs was named the PFC Floyd K.

On 11 November 1943, this soldier's platoon was furnishing machinegun support for a rifle company attacking a hill near Mignano, Italy, when the enemy counterattacked, forcing the riflemen and half the machinegun platoon to retire to a defensive position. Pfc. Lindstrom saw that his small section was alone and outnumbered 5 to 1, yet he immediately deployed the few remaining men into position and opened fire with his single gun. The enemy centered fire on him with machinegun, [[machine pistol]]s, and grenades. Unable to knock out the enemy nest from his original position, Pfc. Lindstrom picked up his own heavy machinegun and staggered 15 yards up the barren, rocky hillside to a new position, completely ignoring enemy [[small arms]] fire which was striking all around him. From this new site, only 10 yards from the enemy machinegun, he engaged it in an intense duel. Realizing that he could not hit the hostile gunners because they were behind a large rock, he charged uphill under a steady stream of fire, killed both gunners with his pistol and dragged their gun down to his own men, directing them to employ it against the enemy. Disregarding heavy rifle fire, he returned to the enemy machinegun nest for 2 boxes of ammunition, came back and resumed withering fire from his own gun. His spectacular performance completely broke up the German counterattack. Pfc. Lindstrom demonstrated aggressive spirit and complete fearlessness in the face of almost certain death.<ref name=\"ACMH\">{{ACMH}}{{Cite web\n  |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n  |title = Medal of Honor recipients - World War II (G\u2013L)\n  |work = Medal of Honor citations\n  |date = June 8, 2009\n  |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-g-l.html\n  |accessdate = 2008-01-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\n* By a public law dated December 16, 2014, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] community-based outpatient clinic in Colorado Springs was named the PFC Floyd K.
