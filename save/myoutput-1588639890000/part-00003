In one of the first scholarly works on European socialism written for an American audience, [[Richard T. Ely]]'s 1883 book ''French and German Socialism in Modern Times'', social democrats were characterized as \"the extreme wing of the socialists\" who were \"inclined to lay so much stress on equality of enjoyment, regardless of the value of one's labor, that they might, perhaps, more properly be called communists\".{{sfn|Ely|1883|p=204}} Many parties in this era described themselves as ''Social Democrat'', including the [[General German Workers' Association]] and the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] which merged to form the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], the British [[Social Democratic Federation]] and the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. ''Social Democrat'' continued to be used in this context up to the time of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of October 1917, at which time ''Communist'' came into vogue for individuals and organizations espousing a revolutionary road to socialism.{{sfn|Williams|1985|p=289}} According to Ely: {{cquote|[Social democrats] have two distinguishing characteristics. The vast majority of them are laborers, and, as a rule, they expect the violent overthrow of existing institutions by revolution to precede the introduction of the socialistic state. I would not, by any means, say that they are all revolutionists, but the most of them undoubtedly are.\n\nThe most general demands of the social democrats are the following: The state should exist exclusively for the laborers; land and capital must become collective property, and production be carried on unitedly. Private competition, in the ordinary sense of the term, is to cease.{{sfn|Ely|1883|pp=204\u2013205}}}}\n\nAs a label or term, ''social democracy'' or ''social democratic'' remains controversial among socialists. Some define it as representing non-communist socialists and the ''right-wing'' of socialism during the split with [[communism]]. Others have noted its pejorative use among communists and other socialists. According to Lyman Sargent Tower, \"''socialism'' refers to ''social'' theories rather than to theories oriented to the individual. Because many communists now call themselves ''democratic socialists'', it is sometimes difficult to know what a political label really means. As a result, ''social democratic'' has become a common new label for democratic socialist political parties\".{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=117}} According to Donald Busky: {{cquote|Social democracy is a somewhat controversial term among democratic socialists. Many democratic socialists use ''social democracy '' as a synonym for ''democratic socialism'', while others, particularly revolutionary democratic socialists, do not, the latter seeing social democracy as something less than socialism\u2014a milder, evolutionary ideology that seeks merely to reform capitalism. Communists also use the term ''social democratic'' to mean something less than true socialism that shought only to preserve capitalism by reform rather than by overthrowing and establishing socialism.

[[Austrian School]] economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] also continually used ''socialism'' as a synonym for central planning and ''social democracy'' for state socialism, conflating it with [[fascism]] and opposing social democratic policies, including the welfare state.{{sfnm|1a1=Mises|1y=1936|2a1=Hayek|2y=1944|3a1=Mises|3y=1962}} This is notable in the United States, where ''socialism'' has become a pejorative used by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] to taint [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] policies, proposals and public figures.{{sfnm|1a1=Truman|1y=1952|2a1=Jackson|2y=2012|3a1=Astor|3y=2019}} Those confusions are caused not only by the socialist definition, but by the capitalist definition as well. [[Christian democrats]], [[social liberals]], [[National conservatism|national]] and [[social conservatives]] tend to support some social democratic policies and generally regard capitalism as compatible with a [[mixed economy]].

Lassalle viewed the state as a means through which workers could enhance their interests and even transform the society to create an economy based on [[worker-run cooperative]]s. Lassalle's strategy was primarily electoral and reformist, with Lassalleans contending that the working class needed a political party that fought above all for universal adult male suffrage.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}}\n\n[[File:Social-democracy-before-ww2.svg|thumb|A timeline showing the development of social democracy in Germany before World War II]]\nThe ADAV's party newspaper was called ''The Social Democrat'' ({{lang-de|Der Sozialdemokrat}}).

In his work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was not disappearing, but his acknowledgement of this error is not well known due to the popularity of ''The Communist Manifesto'' and the relative obscurity of ''Theories of Surplus Value''.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|pp=249\u2013250}}\n\n[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Bernstein]], a notable [[Marxist revisionist]] who supported [[reformism]] and [[liberal democracy]]]]\nBernstein criticized Marxism's concept of \"irreconciliable class conflicts\" and Marxism's hostility to [[liberalism]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He challenged Marx's position on liberalism by claiming that [[liberal democrat]]s and social democrats held common grounds that he claimed could be utilized to create a \"socialist republic\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He believed that economic class disparities between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]] would gradually be eliminated through legal reforms and economic redistribution programs.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} Bernstein rejected the Marxian principle of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], claiming that gradualist democratic reforms would improve the rights of the [[working class]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=141}} According to Bernstein, social democracy did not seek to create a socialism separate from bourgeois society, but it instead sought to create a common development based on Western [[humanism]].{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=86}} The development of socialism under social democracy does not seek to rupture existing society and its cultural traditions, but to act as an enterprise of extension and growth.{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=88}} Furthermore, he believed that class cooperation was a preferable course to achieve socialism, rather than class conflict.{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=2}}\n\nBernstein responded to critics that he was not destroying Marxism and instead claimed he was modernizing it as it was required \"to separate the vital parts of Marx's theory from its outdated accessories\". He asserted his support for the Marxian conception of a \"scientifically based\" socialist movement and said that such a movement's goals must be determined in accordance with \"knowledge capable of objective proof, that is, knowledge which refers to, and conforms with, nothing but empirical knowledge and logic\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Bernstein was also strongly opposed to [[dogmatism]] within the Marxist movement. Despite embracing a [[mixed economy]], Bernstein was sceptical of [[welfare state]] policies, believing them to be helpful, but ultimately secondary to the main social democratic goal of replacing capitalism with socialism, fearing that state aid to the unemployed might lead to the sanctioning of a new form of [[pauperism]].{{sfn|Jackson|2008}}\n\n[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], a Marxist who argued in favor of [[revolutionary socialism]]]]\nRepresenting revolutionary socialism, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] staunchly condemned Bernstein's revisionism and reformism for being based on \"opportunism in social democracy\".

In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the revisionists.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=182}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he wrote that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and argued that this made \"us socialists all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels also argued that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring \"social democracy into power as early as 1898\".{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}}\n\nEngels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. While highlighting ''The Communist Manifesto'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\", Engels also wrote to Kautsky the following on 1 April 1895, four months before his death: {{quote|I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality ''quand m\u00eame''.{{efn|''Quand m\u00eame'' literally means \"come what may\", but it is better translated as \"at all costs\".}} Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased.

He claimed that no coherent socialist platform could be equally applicable to different countries and regions due to different political systems in them, noting that Bebel's homeland of Germany at the time was very authoritarian and had limited parliamentary democracy.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}} Jaur\u00e8s compared the limited political influence of socialism in government in Germany to the substantial influence that socialism had gained in France due to its stronger parliamentary democracy.

However, the USPD refused to support the government in response to the atrocities committed by the SPD government-recruited ''Freikorps''.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}\n\nDue to the unrest in Berlin, the drafting of the constitution of the new German republic was undertaken in the city of Weimar and the following political era is referred to as the [[Weimar Republic]]. Upon founding the new government, President Ebert cooperated with liberal members of his coalition government to create the [[Weimar constitution]] and sought to begin a program of nationalization of certain sectors of the economy. Political unrest and violence continued and the government's continued reliance on the help of the far-right and [[counter-revolutionary]] Freikorps militias to fight the [[revolutionary]] Spartacists further alienated potential left-wing support for the SPD.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}} The SPD coalition government's acceptance of the harsh peace conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919 infuriated the German right, including the Freikorps that had previously been willing to cooperate with the government to fight the Spartacists.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}} In March 1920, a group of [[right-wing]] [[militarists]] led by [[Wolfgang Kapp]] and former German military chief-of-staff Erich Ludendorff initiated a briefly successful [[putsch]] against the German government in what became known as the [[Kapp Putsch]], but the putsch ultimately failed and the government was restored. In the [[1920 German federal election]], the SPD's share of the vote significantly declined due to their previous ties to the Freikorps.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}\n\n[[File:Noe Zhordania meets 2nd International delegation. 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Noe Zhordania]] (man with white beard and wearing a white hat on the left side of the car), [[Prime Minister of Georgia|prime minister]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|newly independent Georgia]], attending a meeting of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] in 1920]]\nAfter World War I, several attempts were made at a global level to refound the Second International that collapsed amidst national divisions in the war.

Delegates attending the International's founding meeting were stunned, particularly the Bolshevik representative from Russia Mecheslav Bronsky, who refused to believe this and left the meeting to seek confirmation of this. Upon confirmation, Bronsky did not return to the meeting.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}}\n\nThe overall response from the Vienna International was divided. The Mensheviks demanded that the Vienna International immediately condemn Russia's aggression against Georgia, but the majority as represented by German delegate Alfred Henke sought to exercise caution and said that the delegates should wait for confirmation.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} Russia's invasion of Georgia completely violated the non-aggression treaty signed between Lenin and Zhordania as well as violating Georgia's sovereignty by annexing Georgia directly into the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]]. Tensions between Bolsheviks and social democrats worsened with the [[Kronstadt rebellion]].{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}} This was caused by unrest among leftists against the Bolshevik government in Russia. Russian social democrats distributed leaflets calling for a general strike against the Bolshevik regime and the Bolsheviks responded by forcefully repressing the rebels.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=434}}\n\nRelations between the social democratic movement and Bolshevik Russia descended into complete antagonism in response to the [[Russian famine of 1921]] and the Bolsheviks' violent repression of opposition to their government. Multiple social democratic parties were disgusted with Russia's Bolshevik regime, particularly Germany's SPD and the Netherlands' [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP) that denounced the Bolsheviks for defiling socialism and declared that the Bolsheviks had \"driven out the best of our comrades, thrown them into prison and put them to death\".{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=441}} In May 1923, social democrats united to found their own international, the [[Labour and Socialist International]] (LSI), founded in Hamburg, Germany. The LSI declared that all its affiliated political parties would retain autonomy to make their own decisions regarding internal affairs of their countries, but that international affairs would be addressed by the LSI.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} The LSI addressed the issue of the rise of [[fascism]] by declaring the LSI to be [[anti-fascist]].{{sfn|Ceplair|1987|p=78}} In response to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 between the democratically elected [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government versus the authoritarian right-wing [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] led by [[Francisco Franco]] with the support of [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], the Executive Committee of the LSI declared not only its support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], but also that it supported the Spanish government having the right to purchase arms to fight Franco's Nationalist forces.

Furthermore, social democratic parties declared that the Great Depression demonstrated the need for substantial macroeconomic planning by the state while their free market opponents staunchly opposed this.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=111}} Attempts by social democratic governments to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the ensuing political instability in their countries caused by the depression. The British Labour Party became internally split over said policies while Germany's SPD government did not have the time to implement such policies as Germany's politics degenerated into violent civil unrest pitting the left against the right in which the [[Nazi Party]] rose to power in January 1933 and violently dismantled parliamentary democracy for the next twenty-two years.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}}\n\n[[Hjalmar Branting]], leader of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] (SAP) from its founding to his death in 1925, asserted: \"I believe that one benefits the workers so much more by forcing through reforms which alleviate and strengthen their position, than by saying that only a revolution can help them\".{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=156}} A major development for social democracy was the victory of several social democratic parties in Scandinavia, particularly the SAP in the [[1920 Swedish general election|1920 general election]].{{sfn|Sejersted|2011|p=180}} Elected to a [[minority government]], the SAP created a Socialization Committee that supported a mixed economy combining the best of private initiative with social ownership or control, supporting a substantial socialization \"of all necessary natural resources, industrial enterprises, credit institutions, transportation and communication routes\" that would be gradually transferred to the state.{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|p=44}} It permitted private ownership of the means of production outside of these areas.{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|p=44}}\n\n[[File:Gandhi at Darwen with women.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mohandas Gandhi]], here meeting with female textile workers in Britain, was a leadership figure of India's anti-colonial [[Indian National Congress]], a social democratic party still active]]\nIn 1922, Ramsay MacDonald returned to the leadership of the Labour Party after his brief tenure in the Independent Labour Party. In the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]], the Labour Party won a plurality of seats and was elected as a minority government, but required assistance from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to achieve a majority in parliament. Opponents of Labour falsely accused the party of Bolshevik sympathies. Prime Minister MacDonald responded to these allegations by stressing the party's commitment to reformist gradualism and openly opposing the radical wing in the party.{{sfn|Morgan|2006|pp=43\u201344}} MacDonald emphasized that the Labour minority government's first and foremost commitment was to uphold democratic and responsible government over all other policies. MacDonald emphasized this because he knew that any attempt to pass major socialist legislation in a minority government would endanger the new government as it would be opposed and blocked by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the Liberals, who together held a majority of seats. Labour had risen to power in the aftermath of Britain's severe recession of 1921\u20131922.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\nWith the economy beginning to recover, British trade unions demanded that their wages be restored from the cuts they took in the recession. The trade unions soon became deeply dissatisfied with the MacDonald government and labour unrest and threat of strikes arose in transportation sector, including docks and railways. MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government, whose most controversial action was having Britain recognize the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British conservative tabloid press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', used this to promote a [[red scare]] by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}} Labour lost the 1924 general election and a Conservative government was elected. Although MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the Labour Party stabilized as a capable opposition to the Conservative government by 1927. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled ''Labour and the Nation'' (1928). Labour returned to government in 1929, but it soon had to deal with the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-06069, Rudolf Hilferding mit Gattin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rudolf Hilferding]], a major figure and policymaker in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and the Czechoslovak [[Sopade]]]]\nIn the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist [[Rudolf Hilferding]] proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social democratic and socialist theory. Hilferding was an influential Marxian socialist both inside the social democratic movement and outside, with his pamphlet titled ''Imperialism'' influencing Lenin's own conception of imperialism in the 1910s.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}} Prior to the 1920s, Hilferding declared that capitalism had evolved beyond what had been ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism into what he called organized capitalism. Organized capitalism was based upon [[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make profit within their countries' national boundaries and therefore needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}} Hilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that \"in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state\". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nOriginally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. By the 1920s, Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organized capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that organised capitalism is nothing less than \"the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production\". He went on to say that \"the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nBy the 1930s, social democracy became seen as overwhelmingly representing reformist socialism and supporting liberal democracy,{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=5}} influenced by [[Carlo Rosselli]], an anti-fascist and social democrat in the liberal socialist tradition.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|pp=103\u2013104}} Despite advocating reformism rather than revolution as means for socialism, those social democrats had supported political revolutions to establish liberal democracy such as in Russia and social democratic parties both in exile and in parliaments supported the forceful overthrow of fascist regimes such as in Germany, Italy and Spain. In the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards [[liberal socialism]]. After the party was banned by the Nazis in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through [[Sopade]].{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism. Curt Geyer, who was a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of Weimar Republic social democracy, liberal democratic socialism and stated that the Sopade had held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} [[Willy Brandt]] is a social democrat that has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n[[File:Myrdal 1934.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alva Myrdal]], a prominent figure in the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] in the 1930s and a pioneer in the development of the [[welfare state]] in Sweden]]\nThe only social democratic governments in Europe that remained by the early 1930s were in Scandinavia.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}} In the 1930s, several Swedish social democratic leadership figures, including former Swedish prime minister and secretary and chairman of the Socialization Committee [[Rickard Sandler]] and Nils Karleby, rejected earlier SAP socialization policies pursued in the 1920s for being too extreme.{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|p=44}} Karleby and Sandler developed a new conception of social democracy known as the [[Nordic model]] which called for gradual socialization and redistribution of purchasing power, provision of educational opportunity and support of property rights.

Whereas the 1921\u20131923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 and the resulting economic recovery. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938. However, this policy was criticized because major unemployment still remained a problem in Sweden, even when the budget deficit had been eliminated.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=121}}\n\n[[File:General L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas del R\u00edo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], [[president of Mexico]]<br>(1934\u20131940)]]\nIn the Americas, social democracy was rising as a major political force.

The most important Mexican social democratic government of this time was that led by president [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] and the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Party of the Mexican Revolution]], whose government initiated agrarian reform that broke up vast aristocratic estates and redistributed property to peasants.{{sfn|Hart|1986|p=13}} While deeply committed to social democracy, Cardenas was criticized by his left-wing opponents for being pro-capitalist due to his personal association with a wealthy family and for being corrupt due to his government's exemption from agrarian reform of the estate held by former Mexican president [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. Political violence in Mexico escalated in the 1920s after the outbreak of the [[Cristero War]] in which far-right reactionary clerics staged a violent insurgency against the left-wing government that was attempting to institute [[secularization]] in Mexico.{{sfn|Hart|1986|p=13}}\n\nCardenas' government openly supported Spain's Republican government while opposing Francisco Franco's Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and he staunchly asserted that Mexico was progressive and socialist, working with socialists of various types, including communists.

The combined organization was named the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] and would be Labour's main rival in future years.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=100}} Labour also faced opposition from within its ranks. While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the so-called \"doctrinaire\" [[Harry Holland]], had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. However, some within the party were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A.

In the founding [[Frankfurt Declaration]] on 3 July, its ''Aims and Tasks of Democratic Socialism: Declaration of the Socialist International'' denounced both [[capitalism]] and [[Bolshevism]], better known as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and referred to as Communism\u2014criticizing the latter in articles 7, 8, 9 and 10.{{sfn|Socialist International|1951}}\n\nThe rise of Keynesianism in the [[Western world]] during the [[Cold War]] influenced the development of social democracy.{{sfn|Adams|1993|p=108}} The attitude of social democrats towards capitalism changed as a result of the rise of Keynesianism.{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|2008|p=10}} Capitalism was acceptable to social democrats only if capitalism's typical crises could be prevented and if mass unemployment could be averted, therefore Keynesianism was believed to be able to provide this.{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|2008|p=10}} Social democrats came to accept the market for reasons of efficiency and endorsed Keynesianism as that was expected to reconcile democracy and capitalism.{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|2008|p=10}} According to [[Michael Harrington]], this represented a compromise between capitalism and socialism. While the post-war period of social democracy saw several social democratic parties renouncing orthodox Marxism, they did not lose their revisionist Marxist character, nor did they stop looking at Marx for inspiration such as in the form of [[Marxist humanism]].{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=162}} However, Marxism was associated with the Marxism\u2013Leninism as practized in the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] which social democracy rejected and regarded as \"falsely claim[ing] a share in the Socialist tradition. In fact it has distorted that tradition beyond recognition\". Rather than a close or dogmatic Marxism, social democracy favours an open and \"critical spirit of Marxism\".{{sfn|Socialist International|1951}}\n\nFor Harrington, social democracy believes that capitalism be reformed from within and that gradually a socialist economy will be created. The \"social democratic compromise\" involving Keynesianism led to a capitalism under socialist governments that would generate such growth that the surplus would make possible \"an endless improvement of the quality of social life\". According to Harrington, the socialists had become the \"normal party of government\" in Europe while their \"conservative opponents were forced to accept measures they had once denounced on principle\". While this socialist pragmatism led in theory and practice to utopias hostile to one another, they all shared basic assumptions. This \"social democratic compromise\" goes back to the 1930s, when there was \"a ferment in the movement, a break with the old either/or Kautskyan tradition, a new willingness to develop socialist programs that could work with and modify capitalism, but that fell far short of a \"revolutionary\" transformation\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Clement Attlee.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Clement Attlee]], prime minister of the United Kingdom (1945\u20131951)]]\nAfter the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], a Labour government was formed by [[Clement Attlee]].

In ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956),{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=93}} British social democratic theorist [[Anthony Crosland]] argued that socialism should be about the reforming of capitalism from within.{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006|p=14}} Crosland claimed that the traditional socialist programme of abolishing capitalism on the basis of capitalism inherently causing [[Immiseration thesis|immiseration]] had been rendered obsolete by the fact that the post-war Keynesian capitalism had led to the expansion of affluence for all, including full employment and a welfare state.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} He claimed that the rise of such an affluent society had resulted in class identity fading and as a consequence socialism in its traditional conception as then supported by the British Labour Party was no longer attracting support.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} Crosland claimed that the Labour Party was associated in the public's mind as having \"a sectional, traditional, class appeal\" that was reinforced by bickering over nationalization.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} He argued that in order for the Labour Party to become electable again it had to drop its commitment to nationalization and to stop equating nationalization with socialism.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} Instead of this, Crosland claimed that a socialist programme should be about support of social welfare, redistribution of wealth and \"the proper dividing line between the public and private spheres of responsibility\".{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} In 1945, the SPD in [[West Germany]] endorsed a similar policy on nationalizations to that of the British Labour government. SPD leader [[Kurt Schumacher]] declared that the SPD was in favour of nationalizations of key industrial sectors of the economy such as banking and credit, insurance, mining, coal, iron, steel, metal-working and all other sectors that were identified as monopolistic or cartelized.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=155}}\n\n{{multiple image|total_width=330|image1=Bundesarchiv Bild 183-61849-0001, Indien, Otto Grotewohl bei Ministerpr\u00e4sident Nehru cropped.jpg|width1=217|height1=348|caption1=[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[prime minister of India]] (1947\u20131964)|image2=Ben Gurion 1959.jpg|width2=270|height2=382|caption2=[[David Ben-Gurion]], the first [[prime minister of Israel]] (1948\u20131954, 1955\u20131963)}}\nUpon becoming a sovereign state in 1947, India elected the social democratic [[Indian National Congress]] into government, with its leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] becoming the Indian prime minister.

Giddens defines socialism as \"the pursuit of ideas of social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality\u2014ideas brought together by a condemnation of the evils and injustices of capitalism\".

They claim that this formed the foundation of \"the Right's moral trap\" in which the neoliberal right's attacks on economic planning policies provokes a defense of such planning by the left as being morally necessary and ends with the right then rebuking such policies as being inherently economically incompetent while presenting itself as the champion of economic competence and responsibility.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=50}} Cramme and Diamond state that social democracy has five different strategies both to address the economic crisis in global markets at present that it could adopt in response, namely market conforming, market complimenting, market resisting, market substituting and market transforming.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=54}} Cramme and Diamond identify market conforming as being equivalent to British Labour Party politician and former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]]'s desire for a very moderate socialist agenda based above all upon fiscal prudence as Snowden insisted that socialism had to build upon fiscal prudence or else it would not be achieved.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=55}}\n\nDemocratic and market socialists alike have criticized the Third Way for abandoning socialism, arguing that the major reason for the economic shortcomings of Soviet-type economies was their authoritarian nature rather than socialism itself and that it was a failure of a specific model, therefore social democrats should support democratic models of socialism rather than the Third Way. Economists [[Pranab Bardhan]] and [[John Roemer]] argue that Soviet-type economies failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their administrative, command allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with.

According to Dostal, the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition (i.e. blue-collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups) while efforts to attract centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains.

Skarstein emphasized the contrast between social democrats' strong commitment for helping people on the international scene on one side and their strong commitment in favour of welfare policies for the nation's own population on the other.{{sfn|Aune|Myklebust|2018}}\n\nSpain is one of the countries in which the [[PSOE]], the main social democratic party, has been governing for a longer period of time than any other party since the transition to democracy in 1977. However, it has also declined like the European social democratic parties, losing half of its electorate between 2010 and 2015 to Podemos and gaining its worst ever result in the 2015 general election since the restoration of democracy in Spain. Despite this loss, the PSOE returned to power in June 2018 after the government of [[Mariano Rajoy]] was ousted in a vote of no confidence in the aftermath of a corruption scandal, with [[Pedro S\u00e1nchez (politician)|Pedro S\u00e1nchez]] leading the party.

The perception of the party being neoliberal and soft on immigration during the era of neoliberal globalization likewise contributed to its poor electoral performance in the early 21st century.{{sfnm|1a1=Orange|1y=2018|2a1=O'Leary|2y=2018}} In a recent biography, the Danish Social Democrats party leader and prime minister [[Mette Frederiksen]] argued: \"For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes\".{{sfn|Copenhagen|2019}} Frederiksen later shifted her stance on immigration by allowing more foreign labour and reversing government plans to hold foreign criminals offshore after winning government.{{sfnm|1a1=Borshoff|1y=2019|2a1=Stone|2y=2019|3a1=Reuters|3y=2019}}\n\nA 2020 study disputed the notion that anti-immigration positions would help social democratic parties.

Those policies were dubbed as [[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]] by the [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] opposition, but the term was later accepted and re-appropriated by Bismarck.{{sfn|Feuchtwanger|2002|p=221}} It was a set of social programs implemented in Germany that were initiated by Bismarck in 1883 as remedial measures to appease the [[working class]] and reduce support for [[socialism]] and the Social Democrats following earlier attempts to achieve the same objective through Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws.{{sfnm|1a1=Bismarck|1y=1884|2a1=Gregory|2a2=Stuart|2y=2003|2p=207}} This did not prevent the Social Democrats to become the biggest party in parliament by 1912.{{sfn|Boissoneault|2017}}\n\nSimilar policies were later adopted in most of Western Europe, including France and the United Kingdom (the latter in the form of the [[Liberal welfare reforms]]),{{sfn|The National Archive (Liberal Welfare Reforms 1906\u201311)}} with both socialist and liberal parties adopting those policies.{{sfn|Esping-Andersen|2013}} In the United States, the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], a similar social democratic movement predominantly influenced more by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|social liberalism]] than [[Socialism in the United States|socialism]], supported progressive liberals such as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Franklin D.

Contrary to early predictions, this period of high economic growth and national development also included many countries that have been devastated by the war such as Japan ([[Japanese post-war

states}}\nSocial democracy is criticized by other socialists because it serves to devise new means to strengthen the capitalist system which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist system.{{sfn|Clarke|1981|p=2}} According to this view, social democracy fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher [[David Schweickart]] contrasts social democracy with [[democratic socialism]] by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the [[welfare state]] and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently humanised and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. He gives the example that attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=447}} In contrast to social democracy's [[mixed economy]], democratic socialists advocate a [[post-capitalist]] economic system based on either a [[Market economy#Market socialism|market economy]] combined with [[workers' self-management]], or on some form of [[Participatory economy|participatory]], [[decentralized planning]] of the economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=448}}\n\n[[Marxian economics|Marxian]] socialists argue that social democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism such as [[Business cycle#Marxian economics|cyclical fluctuations]], [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism\u2014such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits\u2014creates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.{{sfn|Ticktin|1998|pp=60\u201361}} The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy such as Jonas Hinnfors argue that when social democracy abandoned [[Marxism]], it also abandoned socialism and became a liberal capitalist movement, effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the United States.{{sfn|Hinnfors|2006|pp=117, 137\u2013139}}\n\n[[Market socialism]] is also critical of social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt III]] (grandson of United States president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a [[Property income|property-owning capitalist class]] which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1994|pp=314\u2013315}} The economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] point out that social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements, noting that social democracy in Scandinavian countries has been in decline as the labour movement weakened.{{sfn|Bardhan|Roemer|1992|p=104}}\n\nSome critics claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian [[welfare capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=91|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=2003|2pp=2\u20133}} The democratic socialist political theorist [[Michael Harrington]] argues that social democracy historically supported [[Keynesianism]] as part of a \"social democratic compromise\" between capitalism and socialism. While this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it created welfare states and \"recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=93}} Social democrats in favour of the [[Third Way]] have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as [[Anthony Giddens]] of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}\n\nSocial democracy's reformism has been criticized from both the left and right,{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=2002|2a1=Patnaik|2y=2010|2pp=3\u201321|3a1=Nagin|3y=2018}} for if the left was to govern a capitalist economy, it would have to do so according to capitalist, not socialist, logic. This argument was previously echoed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), writing: \"Socialists had to govern in an essentially capitalist world [...], a social and economic system that would not function except on capitalist lines. [...] If they were to run it, they would have to run it according to its own logic. They would have to \"administer\" capitalism\".{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=114}} Similarly, [[Irving Kristol]] argued: \"Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it\".{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} [[Joseph Stalin]] was a vocal critic of reformist social democrats, later coining the term ''[[social fascism]]'' to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period it embraced a similar [[corporatist]] economic model to the model supported by [[fascism]]. This view was adopted by the [[Communist International]] which argued that capitalist society had entered the [[Third Period]] in which a [[proletarian revolution]] was imminent, but that it could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces.{{sfn|Haro|2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Democratic Socialist Party (disambiguation)|Democratic Socialist Party]]\n* [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Austria]]\n* [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany]]\n* [[International Group of Democratic Socialists]]\n* [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties that have governed]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties and organizations]]\n* [[List of democratic socialists]]\n* [[List of Labour parties]]\n* [[List of left-wing political parties]]\n* [[List of social democratic parties]]\n* [[List of social democrats]]\n* [[Social Democratic Party]]\n* [[Socialist Party]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last=Abjorensen|first=Norman|year=2019|title=Historical Dictionary of Democracy|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538120743|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1993|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=1st hardcover|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719033469|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1998|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|edition=illustrated, reprint|series=Politics Today|location=Manchester, England|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|edition=illustrated, reprint|series=Politics Today|location=Manchester, England|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=2001|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=2nd reprint, revised|series=Politics Today|location=Manchester, England|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719060199|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Aggarwal|editor1-first=J.

interventionism|economic]] and [[social intervention]]s to promote [[social justice]] within the framework of a [[liberal democratic]] [[polity]] and a [[capitalist]]-oriented [[mixed economy]]. The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to [[Representative democracy|representative]] and [[participatory democracy]], measures for [[income redistribution]], [[regulation of the economy]] in the [[Common good|general interest]] and [[social welfare]] provisions.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=1998|1p=827|2a1=Badie|2a2=Berg-Schlosser|2a3=Morlino|2y=2011|2p=2423|3a1=Heywood|3y=2012|3p=128}} Due to longstanding governance by social democratic parties during the [[post-war consensus]] and their influence on socioeconomic policy in Northern and Western Europe, social democracy has become associated with [[Keynesianism]], the [[Nordic model]] and [[welfare state]]s within political circles in the late 20th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Gombert|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Sejersted|2y=2011}} It has also been described as the most common form of Western and modern

conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic, [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[solidaristic]] outcomes.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1992|p=10}} It is characterized by a commitment to policies aimed at curbing [[Social inequality|inequality]], eliminating [[oppression]] of [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged groups]] and eradicating [[poverty]]{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2012|1p=97|2a1=Hoefer|2y=2013|2p=29}} as well as support for universally accessible public services like [[Elderly care|care for the elderly]], [[child care]], [[Universal education|education]], [[Universal health care|health care]] and [[workers' compensation]].{{sfn|Hinchman|Meyer|2007|p=137}} It often has strong connections with the [[labour movement]] and [[trade unions]], being supportive of [[collective bargaining]] rights for workers and measures to extend decision-making beyond politics into the economic sphere in the form of [[co-determination]] for employees and stakeholders.{{sfnm|1a1=Hinchman|1a2=Meyer|1y=2007|1p=91|2a1=Mathers|2a2=Taylor|2a3=Upchurch|2y=2009|2p=51}}\n\nSocial democracy originated as an [[ideology]]

[[social revolution]] to move away from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to a [[post-capitalist]] economy such as [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]],{{sfn|Ely|1883|pp=204\u2013205}} a [[peaceful revolution]] as in the case of [[evolutionary socialism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=4, 14, 135|2a1=Miller|2y=1998|2p=827}} or the establishment and support of a welfare state.{{sfnm|1a1=Gombert|1y=2009|2a1=Sejersted|2y=2011|3a1=Mander|3y=2012}} Its origins lie in the 1860s as a [[revolutionary socialism]] associated with [[orthodox Marxism]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}} Starting in the 1890s, there was a dispute between committed [[revolutionary]] social democrats such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]{{sfn|Starke|2020}} and [[reformist]] social democrats as well as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|Marxist revisionists]] such as [[Eduard Bernstein]], who supported a more [[Gradualism|gradual]] approach grounded in liberal democracy and cross-class cooperation,{{sfnm|1a1=Berman|1y=2006|1pp=200\u2013218|2a1=Angel|2y=2020}} with [[Karl Kautsky]] representing a [[Centrist Marxism|centrist]] position.{{sfn|Kalsang Bhutia|Veenu|2019}} By the 1920s, social democracy became the dominant political tendency along with [[communism]] within the international socialist movement,{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=5}} representing a form of democratic socialism with the aim of achieving socialism peacefully.{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|2a1=Safra|2y=1998|2p=920|3a1=Stevens|3y=2000|3p=1504|4a1=Duignan|4a2=Kalsang Bhutia|4a3=Mahajan|4y=2014}}\n\nBy the 1910s, social democracy had spread worldwide and transitioned towards advocating an evolutionary change from capitalism to socialism using established political processes such as the [[parliament]].{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|pp=80, 137|2a1=Safra|2y=1998|2p=920|3a1=Stevens|3y=2000|3p=1504|4a1=Duignan|4a2=Kalsang Bhutia|4a3=Mahajan|4y=2014}} In the late 1910s, [[socialist parties]] committed to revolutionary socialism renamed themselves [[communist parties]], causing a split in the socialist movement between these supporting the [[October Revolution]] and those opposing it.{{sfn|Lamb|2015|pp=415\u2013416}} Social democrats who were opposed to the [[Bolsheviks]] later renamed themselves as democratic socialists in order to highlight their differences from communists and later in the 1920s from [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninists]],{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1985|1p=289|2a1=Eatwell|2a2=Wright|2y=1999|2p=80|3a1=Busky|3y=2000|3pp=7\u20138}} disagreeing with them on topics such as their opposition to liberal democracy whilst sharing common ideological roots.{{sfn|Duignan|Kalsang Bhutia|Mahajan|2016}}\n\nIn the early post-war era in Western Europe, social democrats rejected the [[Stalinist]] political and economic model then current in the [[Soviet Union]], committing themselves either to an alternative path to socialism or to a compromise between capitalism and socialism.{{sfn|Adams|1993|pp=102\u2013103}} During the post-war period, social democrats embraced a mixed economy based on the predominance of private property, with only a minority of essential [[utilities]] and [[public services]] being under [[public ownership]].{{sfn|Miller|1998|p=827}} As a policy regime, social democracy became associated with Keynesian economics, state interventionism and the welfare state as a way to avoid capitalism's typical crises and avert or prevent mass unemployment,{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|2008|p=10}} without abolishing [[factor markets]], [[private property]] and [[wage labour]].{{sfnm|1a1=Weisskopf|1y=1992|1p=10|2a1=Miller|2y=1998|2p=827|3a1=Jones|3y=2001|3p=1410|4a1=Heywood|4y=2012|4pp=125\u2013128}}\n\nWith the rise of popularity for [[neoliberalism]] and the [[New Right]] by the 1980s,{{sfn|Lewis|Surender|2004|pp=3\u20134, 16}} many social democratic parties incorporated the [[Third Way]] ideology,{{sfn|Whyman|2005|pp=1\u20135}} aiming to fuse [[economic liberalism]] with social democratic [[welfare]] policies.{{sfn|Whyman|2005|pp=61, 215}} By the 2010s, social democratic parties that accepted [[Triangulation (politics)|triangulation]] and the

experienced a drastic decline{{sfnm|1a1=Guinan|1y=2013|2a1=Karnitschnig|2y=2018|3a1=Buck|3y=2018|4a1=Lawson|4y=2018}} as the Third Way had largely [[Social democracy#Decline and rejection of the Third Way (2007\u2013present)|fallen out of favour]] in a phenomenon known as [[Pasokification]].{{sfn|Barbieri|2017}} Scholars have linked the decline of social democratic parties to the declining number of industrial workers, greater economic prosperity of voters and a tendency for these parties to shift from the left to the [[Centrism|centre]] on economic issues, alienating their former base of supporters and voters in the process. This decline has been matched by increased support for more [[left-wing]] and [[Left-wing populism|populist]] parties as well as [[The Left|Left]] and [[Green party|Green]] social democratic parties that rejected neoliberal and Third Way policies.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2009|2a1=Calossi|2y=2016|3a1=Benedetto|3a2=Hix|3a3=Mastrorocco|3y=2019|4a1=Blomb\u00e4ck|4a2=Demker|4a3=Hagevi|4a4=Hinnfors|4y=2019|5a1=Berman|5a2=Snegovaya|5y=2019}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Overview ==\n=== Definition ===\nSocial democracy is defined as one of many [[socialist traditions]].{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|pp=80\u201387}} As a [[political movement]], it aims to achieve [[socialism]] through [[Gradualism|gradual]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] means.{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|2a1=Safra|2y=1998|2p=920|3a1=Stevens|3y=2000|3p=1504|4a1=Duignan|4a2=Kalsang Bhutia|4a3=Mahajan|4y=2014}} This definition goes back to the influence of both the [[reformist socialism]] of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] as well as the [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] [[revolutionary socialism]] advanced by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], from whom social democracy was influenced.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} As an international political movement and [[ideology]], social democracy has undergone various major forms throughout its history.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=1998|1p=827|2a1=Durlauf|2a2=Lawrence|2y=2008}} Whereas in the 19th century it was \"organized Marxism\", social democracy became \"organized reformism\" by the 20th century.{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=80}} In contemporary usage, social democracy as a policy regime{{sfnm|1a1=Egle|1a2=Henkes|1a3=Merkel|1a4=Petring|1y=2008|2a1=Kotz|2y=2009|3a1=Foster|3a2=Tsakiroglou|3y=2014}} generally means support for a [[mixed economy]] and ameliorative measures to benefit the [[working class]] within the framework of [[capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hinchman|1a2=Meyer|1y=2007|1p=112|2a1=Badie|2a2=Berg-Schlosser|2a3=Morlino|2y=2011|2p=2423|3a1=Heywood|3y=2012|3p=128}}\n\nIn political science, ''democratic socialism'' and ''social democracy'' are largely seen as synonyms{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1p=8|2a1=Sargent|2y=2008|2p=118|3a1=Heywood|3y=2012|3p=97|4a1=Hain|4y=2015|4p=3}} while they are distinguished in journalistic use.{{sfnm|1a1=Qiu|1y=2015|2a1=Barro|2y=2015|3a1=Tupy|3y=2016|4a1=Worstall|4y=2016|5a1=Cooper|5y=2018|6a1=Rodriguez|6y=2018|7a1=Levitz, April 2019}} Under this democratic socialist definition,{{efn|\"Social democracy is a political ideology focusing on an evolutionary road to socialism or the humanization of capitalism. It includes parliamentary process of reform, the provision of state benefits to the population, agreements between labor and the state, and the revisionist movement away from revolutionary socialism.\"{{sfn|O'Hara|2003|p=538}} \"By the early twentieth century, [...] many such [social democratic] parties had come to adopt parliamentary tactics and were committed to a gradual and peaceful transition to socialism.

In one of the first scholarly works on European socialism written for an American audience, [[Richard T. Ely]]'s 1883 book ''French and German Socialism in Modern Times'', social democrats were characterized as \"the extreme wing of the socialists\" who were \"inclined to lay so much stress on equality of enjoyment, regardless of the value of one's labor, that they might, perhaps, more properly be called communists\".{{sfn|Ely|1883|p=204}} Many parties in this era described themselves as ''Social Democrat'', including the [[General German Workers' Association]] and the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] which merged to form the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], the British [[Social Democratic Federation]] and the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. ''Social Democrat'' continued to be used in this context up to the time of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of October 1917, at which time ''Communist'' came into vogue for individuals and organizations espousing a revolutionary road to socialism.{{sfn|Williams|1985|p=289}} According to Ely: {{cquote|[Social democrats] have two distinguishing characteristics. The vast majority of them are laborers, and, as a rule, they expect the violent overthrow of existing institutions by revolution to precede the introduction of the socialistic state. I would not, by any means, say that they are all revolutionists, but the most of them undoubtedly are.\n\nThe most general demands of the social democrats are the following: The state should exist exclusively for the laborers; land and capital must become collective property, and production be carried on unitedly. Private competition, in the ordinary sense of the term, is to cease.{{sfn|Ely|1883|pp=204\u2013205}}}}\n\nAs a label or term, ''social democracy'' or ''social democratic'' remains controversial among socialists. Some define it as representing non-communist socialists and the ''right-wing'' of socialism during the split with [[communism]]. Others have noted its pejorative use among communists and other socialists. According to Lyman Sargent Tower, \"''socialism'' refers to ''social'' theories rather than to theories oriented to the individual. Because many communists now call themselves ''democratic socialists'', it is sometimes difficult to know what a political label really means. As a result, ''social democratic'' has become a common new label for democratic socialist political parties\".{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=117}} According to Donald Busky: {{cquote|Social democracy is a somewhat controversial term among democratic socialists.

Some early British social democrats in the 19th century and 20th century such as the [[Fabians]] claimed that British society was already mostly socialist and that the economy was significantly socialist through government-run enterprises created by conservative and liberal governments which could be run for the interests of the people through their representatives' influence,{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|pp=87\u201388}} an argument reinvoked by some socialists in post-war Britain.{{sfnm|1a1=Crosland|1y=1952|2a1=Kynaston|2y=2009|2p=82}} Advents in economics and observation of the failure of state socialism in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries{{sfn|Gey|Kosta|Quaisser|1987}} and in the Western world with the crisis and stagflation of the 1970s,{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2008|2a1=Ehnts|2y=2016|2pp=4\u20135}} combined with the [[neoliberal]] rebuke of [[state interventionism]], resulted in socialists re-evaluating and redesigning socialism.{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|pp=93\u201395}} Some social democrats have sought to keep what they deem are socialism's core values while changing their position on state involvement in the economy, but retaining significant social regulations.{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|pp=96\u2013103}}\n\nWhen [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread in the 20th century until the 1970s, it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European social democracies as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heilbroner|1y=1991|1pp=96\u2013110|2a1=Kendall|2y=2011|2pp=125\u2013127|3a1=Li|3y=2015|3pp=60\u201369}} In 1956, leading British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician and author [[Anthony Crosland]] claimed that capitalism had been abolished in Britain,{{sfnm|1a1=Crosland|1y=1952|2a1=Eatwell|2a2=Wright|2y=1999|2p=93}} although others such as Welshman [[Aneurin Bevan]], Minister of Health in the first [[post-war Labour government]] and the architect of the [[National Health Service]], disputed the claim that Britain was a socialist state.{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=1958|2a1=Crosland|2y=2006|2pp=9, 89}} For Crosland and others who supported his views, Britain was a socialist state.{{sfnm|1a1=Crosland|1y=1952|2a1=Kynaston|2y=2009|2p=82}} According to Bevan, Britain had a socialist [[National Health Service]] which stood in opposition to the [[hedonism]] of Britain's capitalist society.{{sfn|Bevan|1952|p=106}} Although as in the rest of Europe the [[Capital accumulation|laws of capitalism]] still operated fully and [[private enterprise]] dominated the economy,{{sfn|Batson|2017}} some political commentators claimed that during the post-war period, when social democratic parties were in power, countries such as Britain and France were democratic socialist states and the same claim is now applied to Nordic countries with the Nordic model.{{sfnm|1a1=Heilbroner|1y=1991|1pp=96\u2013110|2a1=Kendall|2y=2011|2pp=125\u2013127|3a1=Li|3y=2015|3pp=60\u201369}} In the 1980s, the government of President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] aimed to expand [[dirigism]] and attempted to nationalize all French banks, but this attempt faced opposition of the [[European Economic Community]] because it demanded a free-market economy among its members.{{sfnm|1a1=Cobham|1y=1984|21pp=351\u2013358|2a1=Cohen|2y=2010}} Nevertheless, [[public ownership]] never accounted for more than 15\u201320% of [[capital formation]], further dropping to 8% in the 1980s and below 5% in the 1990s after the rise of neoliberalism.{{sfn|Batson|2017}}\n\nOne issue of social democracy is the response to the collapse of legitimacy for state socialism and state-interventionist economics of [[Keynesianism]] with the discovery of the phenomenon of [[stagflation]] which has been an issue for the legitimacy of state socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2008|2a1=Ehnts|2y=2016|2pp=4\u20135}} This has provoked re-thinking of how socialism should be achieved by social democrats,{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|p=253}} including changing views by social democrats on private property\u2014anti-Third Way social democrats such as Robert Corfe have advocated a socialist form of private property as part of a new socialism (although Corfe technically objects to the term ''private property'' to collectively describe property that is not publicly owned as being vague) and rejecting state socialism as a failure.{{sfnm|1a1=Corfe|1y=2001|1p=74|2a1=Corfe|2a2=Miller|2y=2002|2p=51|3a1=Corfe|3y=2005|3p=20}} Third Way social democracy was formed as response to what its proponents saw as a crisis in the legitimacy of socialism\u2014especially state socialism\u2014and the rising legitimacy for neoliberalism, especially ''laissez-faire'' capitalism.

Although the latter theoretically won out by the late 1960s and Lassalle had died early in 1864, in practice the Lassallians won out as their national-style social democracy and reformist socialism influenced the revisionist development of the 1880s and 1910s.{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=87}} The year 1864 saw the founding of the [[International Workingmen's Association]], also known as the First International. It brought together socialists of various stances and initially caused a conflict between [[Karl Marx]] and the [[anarchists]], who were led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]], over the role of the [[State (polity)|state]] in socialism, with Bakunin rejecting any role for the state.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=148}} Another issue in the First International was the question of [[reformism]] and its role within socialism.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R66693, Ferdinand Lassalle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ferdinand Lassalle]], founder of the [[General German Workers' Association]]]]\nAlthough Lassalle was not a [[Marxist]], he was influenced by the theories of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] and accepted the existence and importance of [[class struggle]]. Unlike Marx and Engels' ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'', Lassalle promoted class struggle in a more moderate form.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} While [[Marx's theory of the state]] saw it negatively as an instrument of [[class rule]] that should only exist temporarily upon the rise to power of the [[proletariat]] and then dismantled, Lassalle accepted the state. Lassalle viewed the state as a means through which workers could enhance their interests and even transform the society to create an economy based on [[worker-run cooperative]]s. Lassalle's strategy was primarily electoral and reformist, with Lassalleans contending that the working class needed a political party that fought above all for universal adult male suffrage.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}}\n\n[[File:Social-democracy-before-ww2.svg|thumb|A timeline showing the development of social democracy in Germany before World War II]]\nThe ADAV's party newspaper was called ''The Social Democrat'' ({{lang-de|Der Sozialdemokrat}}). Marx and Engels responded to the title ''Sozialdemocrat'' with distaste and Engels once writing: \"But what a title: ''Sozialdemokrat''! [...] Why do they not call the thing simply ''The Proletarian''\". Marx agreed with Engels that ''Sozialdemokrat'' was a bad title.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} Although the origins of the name ''Sozialdemokrat'' actually traced back to Marx's German translation in 1848 of the [[The Mountain (1849)|Democratic Socialist Party]] ({{lang-fr|Partie Democrat-Socialist}}) into the Party of Social Democracy ({{lang-de|link=no|Partei der Sozialdemokratie}}), Marx did not like this French party because he viewed it as dominated by the [[middle class]] and associated the word ''Sozialdemokrat'' with that party.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} There was a Marxist faction within the ADAV represented by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], who became one of the editors of the ''Der Sozialdemokrat''.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} While democrats looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a [[democratic revolution]] which in the long run ensured [[liberty, equality and fraternity]], Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a [[bourgeoisie]] indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat.{{sfn|Gildea|2000|pp=207\u2013235}}\n\nFaced with opposition from liberal capitalists to his socialist policies, Lassalle controversially attempted to forge a tactical alliance with the [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[Junkers]] due to their communitarian anti-bourgeois attitudes as well as with Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}} Friction in the ADAV arose over Lassalle's policy of a friendly approach to Bismarck that had incorrectly presumed that Bismarck would in turn be friendly towards them. This approach was opposed by the party's faction associated with Marx and Engels, including Liebknecht.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} Opposition in the ADAV to Lassalle's friendly approach to Bismarck's government resulted in Liebknecht resigning from his position as editor of ''Die Sozialdemokrat'' and leaving the ADAV in 1865. In 1869, [[August Bebel]] and Liebknecht founded the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (SDAP) as a merger of the [[petty-bourgeois]] [[Saxon People's Party]] (SVP), a faction of the ADAV and members of the League of German Workers' Associations (VDA).{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}}\n\nAlthough the SDAP was not officially Marxist, it was the first major working-class organization to be led by Marxists and both Marx and Engels had direct association with the party.

There was intense rivalry and antagonism between the SDAP and the ADAV, with the SDAP being highly hostile to the Prussian government while the ADAV pursued a reformist and more cooperative approach.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=285\u2013286}} This rivalry reached its height involving the two parties' stances on the [[Franco-Prussian War]], with the SDAP refusing to support Prussia's war effort by claiming it was an [[imperialist]] war pursued by Bismarck while the ADAV supported the war as a defensive one because it saw Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and France as an \"overreacting aggressor\".{{sfnm|1a1=Bookchin|1y=1998|1pp=285\u2013286|2a1=Schmidt|2y=2018|2p=102}}\n\n[[File:Barricade18March1871.jpg|thumb|left|A Parisian barricade set up by revolutionary forces of the [[Paris Commune]] in March 1871]]\nIn the aftermath of the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, revolution broke out in France, with revolutionary army members along with working-class revolutionaries founding the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=219}} The Paris Commune appealed both to the citizens of Paris regardless of class as well as to the working class, a major base of support for the government, via militant rhetoric. In spite of such militant rhetoric to appeal to the working class, the Paris Commune received substantial support from the middle-class bourgeoisie of Paris, including shopkeepers and merchants. In part due to its sizeable number neo-[[Proudhonian]]s and [[neo-Jacobin]]s in the Central Committee, the Paris Commune declared that it was not opposed to private property, but that it rather hoped to create the widest distribution of it.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=225}} The political composition of the Paris Commune included twenty-five neo-Jacobins, fifteen to twenty neo-Proudhonians and proto-[[syndicalists]], nine or ten Blanquists, a variety of [[Radicalism (historical)#France|radical republicans]] and a few members of the First International influenced by Marx.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=229}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the Paris Commune's collapse in 1871, Marx praised it in his work ''[[The Civil War in France]]'' (1871) for its achievements in spite of its pro-bourgeois influences and called it an excellent model of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in practice as it had dismantled the apparatus of the bourgeois state, including its huge bureaucracy, military and executive, judicial and legislative institutions, replacing it with a working-class state with broad popular support.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}} The Paris Commune's collapse and the persecution of its [[anarchist]] supporters had the effect of weakening the influence of the [[Bakuninist]] anarchists in the First International which resulted in Marx expelling the weakened rival Bakuninists from the International a year later.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}} In Britain, the achievement of the legalization of trade unions under the [[Trade Union Act 1871]] drew British trade unionists to believe that working conditions could be improved through parliamentary means.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=149}} At the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] of 1872, Marx made a remark in which he admitted that while there are countries \"where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means\", in most European countries \"the lever of our revolution must be force\".{{sfn|Gray|Johnson|Walker|2014|pp=119\u2013120}} In 1875, Marx attacked the [[Gotha Program]] that became the program of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SDP) in the same year in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''.

In his work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was not disappearing, but his acknowledgement of this error is not well known due to the popularity of ''The Communist Manifesto'' and the relative obscurity of ''Theories of Surplus Value''.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|pp=249\u2013250}}\n\n[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Bernstein]], a notable [[Marxist revisionist]] who supported [[reformism]] and [[liberal democracy]]]]\nBernstein criticized Marxism's concept of \"irreconciliable class conflicts\" and Marxism's hostility to [[liberalism]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He challenged Marx's position on liberalism by claiming that [[liberal democrat]]s and social democrats held common grounds that he claimed could be utilized to create a \"socialist republic\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He believed that economic class disparities between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]] would gradually be eliminated through legal reforms and economic redistribution programs.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} Bernstein rejected the Marxian principle of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], claiming that gradualist democratic reforms would improve the rights of the [[working class]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=141}} According to Bernstein, social democracy did not seek to create a socialism separate from bourgeois society, but it instead sought to create a common development based on Western [[humanism]].{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=86}} The development of socialism under social democracy does not seek to rupture existing society and its cultural traditions, but to act as an enterprise of extension and growth.{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=88}} Furthermore, he believed that class cooperation was a preferable course to achieve socialism, rather than class conflict.{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=2}}\n\nBernstein responded to critics that he was not destroying Marxism and instead claimed he was modernizing it as it was required \"to separate the vital parts of Marx's theory from its outdated accessories\". He asserted his support for the Marxian conception of a \"scientifically based\" socialist movement and said that such a movement's goals must be determined in accordance with \"knowledge capable of objective proof, that is, knowledge which refers to, and conforms with, nothing but empirical knowledge and logic\".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Bernstein was also strongly opposed to [[dogmatism]] within the Marxist movement. Despite embracing a [[mixed economy]], Bernstein was sceptical of [[welfare state]] policies, believing them to be helpful, but ultimately secondary to the main social democratic goal of replacing capitalism with socialism, fearing that state aid to the unemployed might lead to the sanctioning of a new form of [[pauperism]].{{sfn|Jackson|2008}}\n\n[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], a Marxist who argued in favor of [[revolutionary socialism]]]]\nRepresenting revolutionary socialism, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] staunchly condemned Bernstein's revisionism and reformism for being based on \"opportunism in social democracy\". Luxemburg likened Bernstein's policies to that of the dispute between Marxists and the opportunistic ''Praktiker'' (\"pragmatists\"). She denounced Bernstein's evolutionary socialism for being a \"petty-bourgeois vulgarization of Marxism\" and claimed that Bernstein's years of exile in Britain had made him lose familiarity with the situation in Germany, where he was promoting evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} Luxemburg sought to maintain social democracy as a revolutionary Marxist creed.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Both Kautsky and Luxemburg condemned Bernstein's philosophy of science as flawed for having abandoned Hegelian dialectics for Kantian philosophical dualism. Russian Marxist [[George Plekhanov]] joined Kautsky and Luxemburg in condemning Bernstein for having a neo-Kantian philosophy.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Kautsky and Luxemburg contended that Bernstein's empiricist viewpoints depersonalized and dehistoricized the social observer and reducing objects down to facts. Luxemburg associated Bernstein with [[Ethical socialism|ethical socialists]] who she identified as being associated with the bourgeoisie and Kantian liberalism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=115}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist reformists and revolutionaries in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist measures while maintaining his belief that revolutionary seizure of power by the proletariat should remain a goal. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the revisionists.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=182}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he wrote that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and argued that this made \"us socialists all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels also argued that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring \"social democracy into power as early as 1898\".{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}}\n\nEngels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. While highlighting ''The Communist Manifesto'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\", Engels also wrote to Kautsky the following on 1 April 1895, four months before his death: {{quote|I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality ''quand m\u00eame''.{{efn|''Quand m\u00eame'' literally means \"come what may\", but it is better translated as \"at all costs\".}} Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased.

The SPD became a party of reform, with social democracy representing \"a party that strives after the socialist transformation of society by the means of democratic and economic reforms\".

During the 1904 Congress of the Second International, Jaur\u00e8s challenged orthodox Marxist August Bebel, the mentor of Kautsky, over his promotion of monolithic socialist tactics. He claimed that no coherent socialist platform could be equally applicable to different countries and regions due to different political systems in them, noting that Bebel's homeland of Germany at the time was very authoritarian and had limited parliamentary democracy.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}} Jaur\u00e8s compared the limited political influence of socialism in government in Germany to the substantial influence that socialism had gained in France due to its stronger parliamentary democracy. He claimed that the example of the political differences between Germany and France demonstrated that monolithic socialist tactics were impossible, given the political differences of various countries.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}}\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Australian Labor Party]] formed the world's first labour party government as well as the world's first social democratic government at a national level in 1910.

After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia in which the Tsarist regime in Russia was overthrown, MacDonald visited the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in June 1917, seeking to persuade Russia to oppose the war and seek peace.

MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government, whose most controversial action was having Britain recognize the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British conservative tabloid press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', used this to promote a [[red scare]] by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}} Labour lost the 1924 general election and a Conservative government was elected. Although MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the Labour Party stabilized as a capable opposition to the Conservative government by 1927. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled ''Labour and the Nation'' (1928). Labour returned to government in 1929, but it soon had to deal with the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-06069, Rudolf Hilferding mit Gattin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rudolf Hilferding]], a major figure and policymaker in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and the Czechoslovak [[Sopade]]]]\nIn the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist [[Rudolf Hilferding]] proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social democratic and socialist theory. Hilferding was an influential Marxian socialist both inside the social democratic movement and outside, with his pamphlet titled ''Imperialism'' influencing Lenin's own conception of imperialism in the 1910s.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}} Prior to the 1920s, Hilferding declared that capitalism had evolved beyond what had been ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism into what he called organized capitalism. Organized capitalism was based upon [[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make profit within their countries' national boundaries and therefore needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}} Hilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that \"in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state\". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nOriginally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. By the 1920s, Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organized capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that organised capitalism is nothing less than \"the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production\". He went on to say that \"the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}\n\nBy the 1930s, social democracy became seen as overwhelmingly representing reformist socialism and supporting liberal democracy,{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=5}} influenced by [[Carlo Rosselli]], an anti-fascist and social democrat in the liberal socialist tradition.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|pp=103\u2013104}} Despite advocating reformism rather than revolution as means for socialism, those social democrats had supported political revolutions to establish liberal democracy such as in Russia and social democratic parties both in exile and in parliaments supported the forceful overthrow of fascist regimes such as in Germany, Italy and Spain. In the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards [[liberal socialism]]. After the party was banned by the Nazis in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through [[Sopade]].{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism. Curt Geyer, who was a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of Weimar Republic social democracy, liberal democratic socialism and stated that the Sopade had held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} [[Willy Brandt]] is a social democrat that has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n[[File:Myrdal 1934.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alva Myrdal]], a prominent figure in the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] in the 1930s and a pioneer in the development of the [[welfare state]] in Sweden]]\nThe only social democratic governments in Europe that remained by the early 1930s were in Scandinavia.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}} In the 1930s, several Swedish social democratic leadership figures, including former Swedish prime minister and secretary and chairman of the Socialization Committee [[Rickard Sandler]] and Nils Karleby, rejected earlier SAP socialization policies pursued in the 1920s for being too extreme.{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|p=44}} Karleby and Sandler developed a new conception of social democracy known as the [[Nordic model]] which called for gradual socialization and redistribution of purchasing power, provision of educational opportunity and support of property rights.

Whereas the 1921\u20131923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 and the resulting economic recovery. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938. However, this policy was criticized because major unemployment still remained a problem in Sweden, even when the budget deficit had been eliminated.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=121}}\n\n[[File:General L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas del R\u00edo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], [[president of Mexico]]<br>(1934\u20131940)]]\nIn the Americas, social democracy was rising as a major political force.

The most important Mexican social democratic government of this time was that led by president [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] and the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Party of the Mexican Revolution]], whose government initiated agrarian reform that broke up vast aristocratic estates and redistributed property to peasants.{{sfn|Hart|1986|p=13}} While deeply committed to social democracy, Cardenas was criticized by his left-wing opponents for being pro-capitalist due to his personal association with a wealthy family and for being corrupt due to his government's exemption from agrarian reform of the estate held by former Mexican president [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]. Political violence in Mexico escalated in the 1920s after the outbreak of the [[Cristero War]] in which far-right reactionary clerics staged a violent insurgency against the left-wing government that was attempting to institute [[secularization]] in Mexico.{{sfn|Hart|1986|p=13}}\n\nCardenas' government openly supported Spain's Republican government while opposing Francisco Franco's Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and he staunchly asserted that Mexico was progressive and socialist, working with socialists of various types, including communists.

The combined organization was named the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] and would be Labour's main rival in future years.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=100}} Labour also faced opposition from within its ranks. While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the so-called \"doctrinaire\" [[Harry Holland]], had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. However, some within the party were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A. Lee]], whose views were a mixture of socialism and [[social credit]] theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party's leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party's rank and file. After a long and bitter dispute, Lee was [[The Lee Affair|expelled]] from the party, establishing his own breakaway [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2015}}\n\nSavage died in 1940 and was replaced by [[Peter Fraser]], who became Labour's longest-serving prime minister. Fraser is best known as New Zealand's leader for most of World War II.

In the founding [[Frankfurt Declaration]] on 3 July, its ''Aims and Tasks of Democratic Socialism: Declaration of the Socialist International'' denounced both [[capitalism]] and [[Bolshevism]], better known as [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and referred to as Communism\u2014criticizing the latter in articles 7, 8, 9 and 10.{{sfn|Socialist International|1951}}\n\nThe rise of Keynesianism in the [[Western world]] during the [[Cold War]] influenced the development of social democracy.{{sfn|Adams|1993|p=108}} The attitude of social democrats towards capitalism changed as a result of the rise of Keynesianism.{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|2008|p=10}} Capitalism was acceptable to social democrats only if capitalism's typical crises could be prevented and if mass unemployment could be averted, therefore Keynesianism was believed to be able to provide this.{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|2008|p=10}} Social democrats came to accept the market for reasons of efficiency and endorsed Keynesianism as that was expected to reconcile democracy and capitalism.{{sfn|Egle|Henkes|Merkel|Petring|2008|p=10}} According to [[Michael Harrington]], this represented a compromise between capitalism and socialism. While the post-war period of social democracy saw several social democratic parties renouncing orthodox Marxism, they did not lose their revisionist Marxist character, nor did they stop looking at Marx for inspiration such as in the form of [[Marxist humanism]].{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=162}} However, Marxism was associated with the Marxism\u2013Leninism as practized in the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] which social democracy rejected and regarded as \"falsely claim[ing] a share in the Socialist tradition. In fact it has distorted that tradition beyond recognition\". Rather than a close or dogmatic Marxism, social democracy favours an open and \"critical spirit of Marxism\".{{sfn|Socialist International|1951}}\n\nFor Harrington, social democracy believes that capitalism be reformed from within and that gradually a socialist economy will be created. The \"social democratic compromise\" involving Keynesianism led to a capitalism under socialist governments that would generate such growth that the surplus would make possible \"an endless improvement of the quality of social life\". According to Harrington, the socialists had become the \"normal party of government\" in Europe while their \"conservative opponents were forced to accept measures they had once denounced on principle\". While this socialist pragmatism led in theory and practice to utopias hostile to one another, they all shared basic assumptions. This \"social democratic compromise\" goes back to the 1930s, when there was \"a ferment in the movement, a break with the old either/or Kautskyan tradition, a new willingness to develop socialist programs that could work with and modify capitalism, but that fell far short of a \"revolutionary\" transformation\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Clement Attlee.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Clement Attlee]], prime minister of the United Kingdom (1945\u20131951)]]\nAfter the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], a Labour government was formed by [[Clement Attlee]].

In ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956),{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|p=93}} British social democratic theorist [[Anthony Crosland]] argued that socialism should be about the reforming of capitalism from within.{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006|p=14}} Crosland claimed that the traditional socialist programme of abolishing capitalism on the basis of capitalism inherently causing [[Immiseration thesis|immiseration]] had been rendered obsolete by the fact that the post-war Keynesian capitalism had led to the expansion of affluence for all, including full employment and a welfare state.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} He claimed that the rise of such an affluent society had resulted in class identity fading and as a consequence socialism in its traditional conception as then supported by the British Labour Party was no longer attracting support.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} Crosland claimed that the Labour Party was associated in the public's mind as having \"a sectional, traditional, class appeal\" that was reinforced by bickering over nationalization.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} He argued that in order for the Labour Party to become electable again it had to drop its commitment to nationalization and to stop equating nationalization with socialism.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} Instead of this, Crosland claimed that a socialist programme should be about support of social welfare, redistribution of wealth and \"the proper dividing line between the public and private spheres of responsibility\".{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} In 1945, the SPD in [[West Germany]] endorsed a similar policy on nationalizations to that of the British Labour government. SPD leader [[Kurt Schumacher]] declared that the SPD was in favour of nationalizations of key industrial sectors of the economy such as banking and credit, insurance, mining, coal, iron, steel, metal-working and all other sectors that were identified as monopolistic or cartelized.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=155}}\n\n{{multiple image|total_width=330|image1=Bundesarchiv Bild 183-61849-0001, Indien, Otto Grotewohl bei Ministerpr\u00e4sident Nehru cropped.jpg|width1=217|height1=348|caption1=[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[prime minister of India]] (1947\u20131964)|image2=Ben Gurion 1959.jpg|width2=270|height2=382|caption2=[[David Ben-Gurion]], the first [[prime minister of Israel]] (1948\u20131954, 1955\u20131963)}}\nUpon becoming a sovereign state in 1947, India elected the social democratic [[Indian National Congress]] into government, with its leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] becoming the Indian prime minister.

In particular, the Third Way has been strongly criticized within the social democratic movement for being neoliberal in nature.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}} Left-wing opponents of  the Third Way claim that it is not a form of socialism and that it represents social democrats who responded to the [[New Right]] by accepting [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=5}} Supporters of Third Way ideals argue that they merely represent a necessary or pragmatic adaptation of social democracy to the realities of the modern world, noting that traditional social democracy thrived during the prevailing international climate of the post-war [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods consensus]] which collapsed in the 1970s.{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}}\n\nWhen he was a British Labour Party MP, Third Way supporter and former British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] wrote in a Fabian pamphlet in 1994 about the existence of two prominent variants of socialism, with one based on a Marxist\u2013Leninist economic determinist and collectivist tradition that he rejected and the other being an ethical socialism that he supported which was based on values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} [[New Labour]] under Blair sought to distance Labour from the conventional definition of socialism{{sfnm|1a1=Giddens|1y=1994|1pp=71\u201372|2a1=Hastings|2a2=Mason|2a3=Pyper|2y=2000|2p=677|3a1=Freeden|3y=2004|3p=198}} and create a new one representing a modern form of democratic liberal socialism.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=127}} However, in practice New Labour sought to avoid regular public use of the word ''socialism'' even in this new definition, out of concerns that it would remind the British electorate of the strongly left-wing political strategy of the Labour Party in the early 1980s.

Giddens defines socialism as \"the pursuit of ideas of social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality\u2014ideas brought together by a condemnation of the evils and injustices of capitalism\".

They claim that this formed the foundation of \"the Right's moral trap\" in which the neoliberal right's attacks on economic planning policies provokes a defense of such planning by the left as being morally necessary and ends with the right then rebuking such policies as being inherently economically incompetent while presenting itself as the champion of economic competence and responsibility.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=50}} Cramme and Diamond state that social democracy has five different strategies both to address the economic crisis in global markets at present that it could adopt in response, namely market conforming, market complimenting, market resisting, market substituting and market transforming.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=54}} Cramme and Diamond identify market conforming as being equivalent to British Labour Party politician and former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]]'s desire for a very moderate socialist agenda based above all upon fiscal prudence as Snowden insisted that socialism had to build upon fiscal prudence or else it would not be achieved.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=55}}\n\nDemocratic and market socialists alike have criticized the Third Way for abandoning socialism, arguing that the major reason for the economic shortcomings of Soviet-type economies was their authoritarian nature rather than socialism itself and that it was a failure of a specific model, therefore social democrats should support democratic models of socialism rather than the Third Way. Economists [[Pranab Bardhan]] and [[John Roemer]] argue that Soviet-type economies failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their administrative, command allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with.

According to Dostal, the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition (i.e. blue-collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups) while efforts to attract centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains.

states}}\nSocial democracy is criticized by other socialists because it serves to devise new means to strengthen the capitalist system which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist system.{{sfn|Clarke|1981|p=2}} According to this view, social democracy fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher [[David Schweickart]] contrasts social democracy with [[democratic socialism]] by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the [[welfare state]] and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently humanised and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. He gives the example that attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=447}} In contrast to social democracy's [[mixed economy]], democratic socialists advocate a [[post-capitalist]] economic system based on either a [[Market economy#Market socialism|market economy]] combined with [[workers' self-management]], or on some form of [[Participatory economy|participatory]], [[decentralized planning]] of the economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=448}}\n\n[[Marxian economics|Marxian]] socialists argue that social democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism such as [[Business cycle#Marxian economics|cyclical fluctuations]], [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism\u2014such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits\u2014creates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.{{sfn|Ticktin|1998|pp=60\u201361}} The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy such as Jonas Hinnfors argue that when social democracy abandoned [[Marxism]], it also abandoned socialism and became a liberal capitalist movement, effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the United States.{{sfn|Hinnfors|2006|pp=117, 137\u2013139}}\n\n[[Market socialism]] is also critical of social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt III]] (grandson of United States president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a [[Property income|property-owning capitalist class]] which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1994|pp=314\u2013315}} The economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] point out that social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement]] to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements, noting that social democracy in Scandinavian countries has been in decline as the labour movement weakened.{{sfn|Bardhan|Roemer|1992|p=104}}\n\nSome critics claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian [[welfare capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=91|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=2003|2pp=2\u20133}} The democratic socialist political theorist [[Michael Harrington]] argues that social democracy historically supported [[Keynesianism]] as part of a \"social democratic compromise\" between capitalism and socialism. While this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it created welfare states and \"recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit\".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=93}} Social democrats in favour of the [[Third Way]] have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as [[Anthony Giddens]] of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}\n\nSocial democracy's reformism has been criticized from both the left and right,{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=2002|2a1=Patnaik|2y=2010|2pp=3\u201321|3a1=Nagin|3y=2018}} for if the left was to govern a capitalist economy, it would have to do so according to capitalist, not socialist, logic. This argument was previously echoed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), writing: \"Socialists had to govern in an essentially capitalist world [...], a social and economic system that would not function except on capitalist lines. [...] If they were to run it, they would have to run it according to its own logic. They would have to \"administer\" capitalism\".{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=114}} Similarly, [[Irving Kristol]] argued: \"Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it\".{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} [[Joseph Stalin]] was a vocal critic of reformist social democrats, later coining the term ''[[social fascism]]'' to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period it embraced a similar [[corporatist]] economic model to the model supported by [[fascism]]. This view was adopted by the [[Communist International]] which argued that capitalist society had entered the [[Third Period]] in which a [[proletarian revolution]] was imminent, but that it could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces.{{sfn|Haro|2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Democratic Socialist Party (disambiguation)|Democratic Socialist Party]]\n* [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Austria]]\n* [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany]]\n* [[International Group of Democratic Socialists]]\n* [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties that have governed]]\n* [[List of democratic socialist parties and organizations]]\n* [[List of democratic socialists]]\n* [[List of Labour parties]]\n* [[List of left-wing political parties]]\n* [[List of social democratic parties]]\n* [[List of social democrats]]\n* [[Social Democratic Party]]\n* [[Socialist Party]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book|last=Abjorensen|first=Norman|year=2019|title=Historical Dictionary of Democracy|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781538120743|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1993|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=1st hardcover|series=Politics Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719033469|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1998|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|edition=illustrated, reprint|series=Politics Today|location=Manchester, England|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|edition=illustrated, reprint|series=Politics Today|location=Manchester, England|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565}}\n: {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=2001|title=Political Ideology Today|edition=2nd reprint, revised|series=Politics Today|location=Manchester, England|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719060199|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite book|editor1-last=Aggarwal|editor1-first=J.
