Play-Yan was released in [[China]] by [[iQue]] under the name of '''MP4 Player for GBA'''.\n\nIt is an MP3 and MPEG-4 player add-on for the Game Boy Advance SP, Nintendo DS, [[Nintendo DS Lite|DS Lite]], and Game Boy Micro. Music and video files stored on an SD memory card can be loaded into a slot on the right side of the Play-Yan, which resembles a Game Boy Advance game cartridge. Due to its power requirement, use with an original Game Boy Advance system is not recommended. The Play-Yan is loaded directly into the Game Boy Advance game slot of a compatible system. While the original Game Boy Advance is compatible, its non-illuminated screen and the Play-Yan's high rate of power consumption do not make the Game Boy Advance a very suitable platform. The Play-Yan is also compatible with the Game Boy Player, but compressed video does not play back as nicely on a television screen as it does on a small, portable screen. Therefore, the Game Boy Player is a somewhat unsuitable platform as well, at least compared to any standard [[DVD player]]. The adapter has its own integrated headphone port, but uses the parent console's power supply, controls, and display. The Play-Yan is advertised as offering sixteen hours of MP3 playback and four hours of MPEG-4 playback on a fully charged Game Boy Advance SP. In addition to multimedia playback, the Play-Yan offers support for minigames which could be downloaded from Nintendo of Japan's website.\n\n== Games ==\n\n# Avoid (2005)\n# Bat (2005)\n# Credit (2005)\n# Fire (2005)\n# Fish (2005)\n# Insect (2005)\n# Jump (2005)\n# Keeper (2005)\n# Memory (2005)\n# Nekodroid (2005)\n# Nose (2005)\n# Triple (2005)\n# Wave (2005)\n\n==Play-Yan Micro==\nTo accompany the September 13, 2005 release of the Game Boy Micro in Japan, Nintendo released an updated version of the original Play-Yan called the Play-Yan Micro for 5,000 yen. The new version is compatible with all of the same systems, and it looks and works the same as the original, but there are a few noticeable differences. The Play-Yan Micro has the added functionality of MP4 and ASF playback, and it has an updated user interface and improved sound quality through its headphone port. Minigame support, however, was removed from the Play-Yan Micro. The Play-Yan Micro was only available through Nintendo of Japan's online store, and for an additional 1,000 yen, it came with a computer application on CD called \"MediaStage Ver. 4.2 for Nintendo\" for managing music and video files on a PC.\n\n==Appearances in other games==\nThe stick figure seen in the Play-Yan's interface also appears in the Japan-only GBA game ''[[Rhythm Tengoku]]'', and its arcade version, in the rhythm game ''Night Walk''.

The character also made cameo appearances in ''[[Rhythm Heaven]]'' and ''[[Rhythm Heaven Fever]]'', and has reappeared in the Nintendo 3DS game ''[[Rhythm Heaven Megamix]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Game Boy line}}\n{{Nintendo hardware|Game Boy Advance}}\n\n[[Category:Game Boy accessories]]\n[[Category:Nintendo DS accessories]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Play-Yan.jpg|thumb|Play Yan player]]\nThe '''Play-Yan''' (trademarked '''PLAY-YAN''') is a media player designed for the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] and also compatible with the [[Game Boy Micro]]<nowiki/>and [[Nintendo DS]].
