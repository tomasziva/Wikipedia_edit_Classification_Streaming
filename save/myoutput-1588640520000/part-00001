He was assigned to the [[U.S. 27th Infantry Division]] after completing [[basic training]].\n\n==World War II==\nDuring World War II, the conquest of the Japanese island of [[Okinawa]] was considered vital for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] as a step towards an invasion of the [[Japan]]ese mainland. The invasion (codenamed ''Operation Iceberg'') was the largest amphibious operation of the Pacific war, and involved units of the [[Tenth United States Army|U.S. Tenth Army]], commanded by Lieutenant General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]]  These consisted of III Amphibious Corps ([[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]] and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]]s, with [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] as an afloat reserve), and XXIV Corps ([[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th]], [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]], [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th]] and [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]] Infantry Divisions).\n\nOn April 28, 1945, PFC Ruiz's unit was pinned down by [[machine gun]] fire coming from a camouflaged Japanese [[bunker|pillbox]] and was unable to advance to its assigned objective.  Ruiz, on his own initiative, charged the pillbox under a hail of machine gun fire. On his second attempt, he was able to neutralize the pillbox by killing all of its occupants.  For his actions he was awarded the Medal of Honor.<ref>{{Cite web|accessdate=October 5, 2010 |url=http://www.history.army.mil//lineage/cc/027id.htm |title=27th Infantry Division |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531061417/http://www.history.army.mil/lineage/cc/027id.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2008 }}</ref> On June 26, 1946, President [[Harry S.

Ruiz seized an automatic rifle and lunged through the flying grenades and rifle and automatic fire for the top of the emplacement. When an enemy soldier charged him, his rifle jammed. Undaunted, Pfc.
