It tells the story of six misfit children who volunteer to star in their town's [[Sunday school]] [[Christmas pageant]], and end up teaching the town the true meaning of Christmas.\n\n== Story ==\nThe book is narrated in [[first person perspective]] by the (unnamed) daughter of the pageant's director.\n\nThe six Herdman children - Imogene, Ralph, Claude, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys - are [[juvenile delinquent]]s notorious for their rowdy misfit behavior, including [[cigar]] smoking, [[cussing]], drinking [[jug wine]], and [[shoplifting]]. Despite their poor performance, the Herdmans steadily pass through [[elementary school]] (since holding any one of them back would mean having two or more of them in the same grade).\n\nThey go to [[Sunday school]] for the first time after being told that the church offers snacks. The narrator's mother is flabbergasted when they all volunteer for the lead roles in the Christmas pageant: [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] (Imogene), [[Joseph (father of Jesus)|Joseph]] (Ralph), the [[Three Wise Men]] (Claude, Ollie, and Leroy), and the [[Angel of the Lord]] (Gladys), the last of whom likens her role to a character from ''[[Amazing Comics]]''. Since they've bullied all the usual cast members into remaining silent during the call for volunteers, the director has no choice but to cast them.\n\nHaving never heard the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas story]] before, the Herdmans take an uncharacteristic interest, through which the narrator is surprised to find herself, and her parents, thinking more seriously about the story's harsher aspects: e.g., that the innkeeper forced a pregnant woman and her baby to sleep in a barn, and the Holy Family were on the run from [[Herod the Great|King Herod]], who wanted the baby Jesus killed.\n\nEveryone in town is expecting the Christmas pageant to be a disaster, but the Herdmans' unconventional performances actually make the whole show much more realistic and moving: instead of walking on and off stage like actors, the Herdmans are a little uncertain about where to go and what to do, as the real-life Holy Family and Wise Men must have been; instead of laying the doll representing Jesus in the [[manger]], Imogene insists on holding it, as if it is really her child; the Wise Men choose to bring the baby Jesus a [[ham]] from the Herdmans' own gift basket instead of the \"crummy\" [[frankincense]] and [[myrhh]] from the story; the shepherds are sufficiently terrified of Gladys to look authentically awed by her announcement of Jesus's birth; and during the final scene, the narrator looks over from the choir and is thunderstruck to see Imogene weeping softly while hugging the \"baby\".  By common agreement, it is the best Christmas pageant the town has ever had. <ref name=\"freelance\"/>\n\n== Literary Influences ==\nIn its amiable combination of farce and spirituality, the story appears to be a modern-day reimagining of the medieval [[Second Shepherds' Play]], the surname \"Herdman\" being a thinly disguised [[synonym]] of \"Shepherd.\"\n\n== Publication and Reception ==\nRobinson first published the story in ''[[McCall's]]'' magazine before it was adapted into a book, which sold over 800,000 copies.<ref name=\"freelance\"/>\n\n==Stage and Screen Adaptations==\n\nThe book was adapted by Robinson into a play which was first performed on November 26, 1982 by the [[Seattle Children's Theatre]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pquyPWxBCIYC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=%22the+best+christmas+pageant+ever%22+%22script%22&source=bl&ots=kGgYw6yR6P&sig=ZYTq0JDaqGzHMzbkzCcX2qmDW98&hl=en&ei=Fh1cTJOlE4PWtQOFjeEN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22the%20best%20christmas%20pageant%20ever%22%20%22script%22&f=false Playscript of The best Christmas pageant ever By Barbara Robinson]</ref> \n\"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\" is a play performed annually for over 20 years by Stage One, the world renowned Theatre for Young Audiences in Louisville, KY.
