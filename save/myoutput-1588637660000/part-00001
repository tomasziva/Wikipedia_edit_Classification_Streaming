Barak Ravid of Israel's [[Channel 13 (Israel)|Channel 13]] news revealed that Gantz, despite previously claiming that he wanted to implement the peace plan, still wanted to hold peace talks with the Palestinians, which Trump and Netanyahu still opposed. Ravid stated that this would likely make the upcoming deal between Gantz and Netanyahu short-lived. As part of the proposed coalition deal between Netanyahu and Gantz, Gantz was to replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel after 18 months' government.<ref name= \"gantzcrack\">{{cite web |url= https://www.axios.com/trump-peace-plan-annexation-gantz-netanyahu-02d228a7-b5a9-49e7-ac15-e8676a193ce7.html |title=Trump peace plan a sticking point in Israel's Netanyahu-Gantz pact | first =Barak | last = Ravid |date=27 March 2020 |work=[[Axios (website) |Axios]] |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Gantz's term as prime minister-designate was going to end on 14 April,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-faces-a-rebellion-on-the-right-as-new-government-takes-shape/ |title=Netanyahu faces a rebellion on the right as new government takes shape | first =Haviv Retig | last = Gur |date=1 April 2020 |work=[[The Times of Israel]] |accessdate= 1 April 2020}}</ref> though President Rivlin extended it until 15 April.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-Gantz-address-the-nation-hours-before-end-of-Gantzs-mandate-624558 |title=Netanyahu, Gantz to continue talks in morning to close deal | first =Gil | last = Hoffman |date=14 April 2020 |work= [[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Coalition government ===\nOn 20 April 2020, Gantz and Netanyahu announced that agreement on a unity government had been reached. The deal would involve both parties sharing power, and Gantz and Netanyahu taking turns being prime minister. Under the terms of the agreement Netanyahu is to be prime minister until October 2021, with Gantz serving as vice prime minister. After that time the men are to exchange roles. However, should Netanyahu leave the premiership early, Gantz is to take over the role. Several watchdog groups in Israel, including the [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel]] and other groups, reacted to the news by petitioning the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] to block the formation of the government due to the indictment of Netanyahu.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/a-joint-meeting-between-netanyahu-and-gantz-to-start-soon-625241 |title=The deal is done: Netanyahu, Gantz ink coalition pact |website=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |access-date=22 April 2020 |date=21 April 2020 |author=Gil Hoffman}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[2019 in Israel]]\n*[[2020 in Israel]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://www.knesset.gov.il/govt/eng/GovtByNumber_eng.asp Governments of Israel] at the [[Knesset]] website\n*[https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/State/Government/Pages/default.aspx The Government of Israel] at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] website\n*[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-government-cabinet-and-ministers Government Cabinet & Ministers] at the [[Jewish Virtual Library]] website\n\n{{Israeli governments}}\n{{Benjamin Netanyahu}}\n{{Portal bar|Israel|Modern history|Politics}}\n\n[[Category:2010s in Israeli politics| 35]]\n[[Category:2019 in Israeli politics]]\n[[Category:2020 in Israeli politics]]\n[[Category:2020s in Israeli politics| 35]]\n[[Category:Israeli governments| 35]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-fifth_government_of_Israel"}
