Originally housed in a single brick building at the corner of Halleck and Adams Streets, Papillion's only school served students in all 12 grades. In 1893 the school moved to a new brick building at 420 S. Washington Street (the present site of the district offices). The city continued to grow, and in February 1957, Papillion High School opened in a new building across Washington Street (presently Papillion Jr. High) to students in grades 7-12. The high school moved out of the building to its present site (Papillion-La Vista) in north Papillion in August 1971.\n\nOn February 17, 1966 the original Papillion School, built in 1893, was razed to make room for the new junior high school, which was opened in 1967. Nine years later, a new junior high was built in neighboring La Vista to help ease crowding at the current school. Before a new high school was opened, these two junior highs both enrolled ninth grade students. Currently ninth graders attend both high schools, although more go to Papillion South High School. The school's original boundary was Papio Creek; today it is the city limits.\n\n== Athletics ==\nPapillion Junior High offers [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[wrestling]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[volleyball]].\n\n== See also==\n* [[Papillion La Vista Senior High School]]\n* [[Papillion La Vista South High School]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://archive.is/20041026170416/http://www.plvschools.esu3.org/papiojh/ Papillion Junior High School] official website\n\n[[Category:Public middle schools in Nebraska]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1967]]\n[[Category:Schools in Sarpy County, Nebraska]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox school\n| name        = Papillion Middle School\n| image       = \n| imagesize   =\n| motto       = \"A Reflection of Excellence\"\n| established = 1971 (1957, 1893)\n| grades      = 7\u20138\n| district    = [[Papillion-La Vista Public Schools]]\n| type        = [[Public school (government funded)|Public]] [[middle school]]\n| principal   = Timothy Johnson (head), Brian Marek (assistant)\n| enrollment  = Over 800\n| faculty     = \n| ratio       = Approximately 23:1 \n| teamname    = Titan\n| conference  = \n| colors      = {{Color box|blue|border=darkgray}}{{Color box|black|border=darkgray}}{{Color box|silver|border=darkgray}}<br />Blue, black, and silver\n| publication = \n| location    = 423 S.
