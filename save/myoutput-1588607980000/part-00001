The Hotel and Guesthouse Accommondation Ordinance (Cap 349) defines residences leased out for less than 28 consecutive days as a guesthouse, which requires a licence to operate, with unlawful operation of guesthouses being a criminal offence. The Lands Department confirmed that House 61A was a licensed house ({{zh|\u724c\u7167\u5c4b}}), with the licence limiting the house to be used as storage. The [[Home Affairs Department]] additionally confirmed that a guesthouse licence has not been obtained for House 61A, suggesting that it was operated illegally as a guesthouse.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u9676\u8f1d\u6d89\u8fa6\u7121\u724c\u6c11\u5bbf \u6c11\u653f\u7f72\u8ddf\u9032 \u724c\u7167\u5c4b\u7591\u9738\u5b98\u5730\u50ed\u5efa \u5730\u7f72\u8b49\u9650\u5132\u7269\u7528\u9014 |url=https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%E8%A6%81%E8%81%9E/article/20200502/s00001/1588358354921/%E9%99%B6%E8%BC%9D%E6%B6%89%E8%BE%A6%E7%84%A1%E7%89%8C%E6%B0%91%E5%AE%BF-%E6%B0%91%E6%94%BF%E7%BD%B2%E8%B7%9F%E9%80%B2-%E7%89%8C%E7%85%A7%E5%B1%8B%E7%96%91%E9%9C%B8%E5%AE%98%E5%9C%B0%E5%83%AD%E5%BB%BA-%E5%9C%B0%E7%BD%B2%E8%AD%89%E9%99%90%E5%84%B2%E7%89%A9%E7%94%A8%E9%80%94 |website=Ming Pao |accessdate=4 May 2020 |language=Chinese |date=2 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category-inline|Hong Kong Police Force}}\n*\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dover, Rupert}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong police officers]]\n[[Category:People from Hertford]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to Hong Kong]]\n", "name_user": "17jiangz1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Dover"}
