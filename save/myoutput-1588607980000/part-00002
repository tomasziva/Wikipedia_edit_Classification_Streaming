He was the son of Godfrey Goodman (senior) and Jane Croxton, landed gentry living in [[Wales]]. His contemporaries describe him as being a hospitable, quiet man, and lavish in his charity to the poor.\n\n==Education and career==\nGoodman was born in [[Ruthin]], [[Denbighshire]].  From 1593, Goodman was originally educated at [[Ruthin School]] but was later sent to [[Westminster School]], where he remained seven years under the protection of his uncle, [[Gabriel Goodman]], [[Dean of Westminster]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} He was an earnest student and when only seventeen won a scholarship at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He graduated there in 1604 and shortly after was ordained at [[Bangor, Wales]].<ref>{{acad|id=GDMN600G|name=Goodman, Godfrey}}</ref>\n\nGoodman's first appointment was to the rectory of [[Stapleford Abbotts]], [[Essex]], in 1606. He made rapid progress in the Church, and was made successively [[prebend of Westminster]] in 1607; [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[West Isley]], [[Berkshire]], in 1616; Rector of [[Lower Kinnerton|Kinnerton]], [[Gloucester]]; [[Canon of Windsor]] and [[prebend]]ary of [[Hatherton, Staffordshire]] in [[St Peter's Collegiate Church]], [[Wolverhampton]]<ref>{{cite book |editor= William Salt Archaeological Society |title= Collections for a History of Staffordshire |volume=1915 Yearbook |location=London |publisher=Harrison |year=1915|url=https://archive.org/stream/collectionsfor1915stafuoft#page/n415/mode/2up |page=330 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref> in 1617; [[Dean of Rochester]] in 1621; and finally [[Bishop of Gloucester]], 1624-1655. In addition, he held two livings in [[Wales]], at [[Llandyssil]] and [[Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr|Llanarmon]]. Even as a bishop, he was allowed to retain most of these appointments.\n\n==Involvement with Catholicism==\nGoodman became one of the Court preachers and was chaplain to [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], wife of [[James I of England|James I]]. His leaning towards [[Roman Catholicism]] made enemies for him at Windsor, and he was reprimanded by the King over Court sermons. A few years later, he was severely reprimanded for having erected a crucifix at Windsor and using altar-cloths with a cross design in his own cathedral at Gloucester, and further for having suspended a minister who insisted on preaching \"that all who die papists go inevitably to hell\".\n\nIt is likely that doubts were arising in his mind about the legitimacy of the Church's separation from [[Roman Catholic church|Rome]], and he sought the society of Catholic priests who were in hiding throughout the country. He was frequently at variance with [[William Laud|Archbishop Laud]], and in 1640 refused on conscientious grounds to sign the seventeen Articles drawn up by the Archbishop. He was thereupon arrested, but after five weeks in prison he overcame his scruples and signed the Articles. This, however, availed him little, as he was soon impeached by Parliament along with Laud and the ten other signatories of the Articles and was sent to prison for treason in the [[Tower of London]] for four months.\n\nIn 1643, Goodman's episcopal palace was pillaged by parliamentarian soldiers and over the course of a couple of years he was stripped of all his emoluments. He withdrew from public life to his small Welsh estate in [[Caernarfon|Carnarvon]], and it is likely that he converted to Catholicism at this time.\n\nIn about 1650, he came to London, and gave himself up to study and research; he was befriended by some Catholic [[Cavalier|royalist]]s and lived in close connection with them until his death in 1656. Father Davenport, O.S.F., former chaplain to [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta]], was his confessor and attended him in his last illness. He died, aged 62 or 63, at [[Westminster]].  By his will, in which he made a profession of his Catholic faith, he left most of his property to [[Ruthin]], his native town; his manuscripts and books, however, were given to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\n==Principal works==\n* ''The Fall of Man, or the Corruption of Nature proved by the light of his Natural Reason'' (1616)\n* ''The two mysteries of the Christian Religion, the Trinity and the lncarnation, explicated'' (1653)\n* ''Arguments and animadversions on Dr. George Hakewil's Apology''\n* ''The Creatures praysing God'' (1622)\n* ''The Court of King James the First by Sir A.W. reviewed''\n\nGoodman's 1620s prose text, \"See, see the Word is incarnate\", describing the life of Christ, was set to music by the English composer [[Orlando Gibbons]] as a [[verse anthem]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sterrett |first1=Joseph |title=Prayer and Performance in Early Modern English Literature: Gesture, Word and Devotion |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108429726 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1RNwDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA121&dq=Godfrey%20Goodman%20see%20the%20word%20is%20incarnate&pg=PA121#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=1 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester - Geoffrey Soden, SPCK 1953''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Catholic}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-rel|en}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Bishop of Gloucester]] | before=[[Miles Smith (bishop)|Miles Smith]] | after=vacancy to 1660<br>[[William Nicholson (bishop of Gloucester)|William Nicholson]] | years= 1625&ndash;1655}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Bishop of Hereford]]<br>declined election | before=[[William Juxon]] | after=[[Augustin Lindsell]] | years= 1634&ndash;1634}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Deans of Rochester}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goodman, Godfrey}}\n[[Category:Bishops of Gloucester]]\n[[Category:17th-century Anglican bishops]]\n[[Category:1580s births]]\n[[Category:1656 deaths]]\n[[Category:People of the Elizabethan era]]\n[[Category:People of the Stuart period]]\n[[Category:People from Ruthin]]\n[[Category:People educated at Ruthin School]]\n[[Category:People educated at Westminster School, London]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Canons of Windsor]]\n[[Category:Deans of Rochester]]\n[[Category:16th-century Welsh people]]\n[[Category:17th-century Welsh people]]\n[[Category:Household of Anne of Denmark]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British Anglican bishop}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n'''Godfrey Goodman''', also called Hugh; (28 February 1582 or 1583 \u2013 19 January 1656) was the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Bishop of Gloucester]], and a member of the [[Protestant Church]].
