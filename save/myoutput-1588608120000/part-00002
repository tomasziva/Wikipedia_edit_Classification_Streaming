Hyde|thumb|Pro-life Congressman Henry J. Hyde]]\nThe Hyde Amendment was introduced by pro-life Congressman [[Henry Hyde|Henry J. Hyde]] and first passed by Congress in 1977, four years after ''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe vs. Wade]]''. Implementation of the initial amendment was blocked for almost a year by an injunction in the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/448/297 ''McRae v. Matthews''] case. During this case, the Reproductive Freedom Project, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], and [[Planned Parenthood]] collectively represented a pregnant Medicaid recipient and health care providers who challenged the Hyde Amendment. The United States Supreme Court vacated the injunction in August 1977, leading abortions financed by federal Medicaid to drop from 300,000 per year to a few thousand.<ref name=\":3\" /> Other bans were modeled after the Hyde Amendment, extending to other annual spending bills in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This eventually led federal funds to be banned in federal worker health plans, women in federal prisons, women in the military, peace corps volunteers, and international family planning programs that use non-U.S. funds to perform or advocate for abortion.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nThe Hyde Amendment has been reenacted every year since 1976, but exceptions have varied.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nFor example, the 1978 Amendment presented new exceptions for rape survivors and incest cases.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, in 1980, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the original Hyde Amendment language with a 5\u20134 vote in ''[[Harris v. McRae]]''. The majority found that the Hyde Amendment did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or due process/equal protection provided by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33467.pdf|title=Abortion: Judicial History and Legislative Response|last=Shimabukuro|first=Jon O.|date=October 13, 2016|website=Congressional Research Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  This case decided the single exception for the Amendment would be in cases where the woman's life is endangered. This decision was upheld from fiscal years 1981\u20131993.<ref name=\":3\" /> While the Supreme Court came close to reintroducing exceptions for cases of rape or incest in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services|Webster v. Reproductive Health Services of Missouri]]'', President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] succeeded in vetoing the bill despite an attempted House override.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>  This decision left the Amendment with the sole exception of concern being endangered life of the mother. The language was not altered until the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] in 1993. At this time, the Hyde Amendment was once again expanded to include exceptions for rape and incest cases.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLater in ''Williams v. Zbaraz'' (1980), the United States Supreme Court upheld that states could constitutionally make their own versions of the Hyde Amendment,<ref name=\":3\" /> and states/the federal government have no statutory or constitutional obligation to fund elective abortions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCurrently, 17 states extend abortion coverage to women enrolled in Medicaid through their own budgets, and 6 states extend abortion coverage when a woman's health is at risk. The remainder of the country abides by the Hyde Amendment. [[South Dakota]] expands on the Hyde Amendment and restricts funding even in cases of rape or incest.<ref name=\"Hyde Amendment\"/> As of 1994, federal law mandates all states to pay for abortion cases involving rape or incest, proving South Dakota's actions to be problematic.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn January 24, 2017, the House voted to make the Hyde Amendment (H.R. 7) permanent.

Hyde|thumb|Pro-life Congressman Henry J. Hyde]]\nThe Hyde Amendment was introduced by pro-life Congressman [[Henry Hyde|Henry J. Hyde]] and first passed by Congress in 1977, four years after ''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe vs. Wade]]''. Implementation of the initial amendment was blocked for almost a year by an injunction in the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/448/297 ''McRae v. Matthews''] case. During this case, the Reproductive Freedom Project, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], and [[Planned Parenthood]] collectively represented a pregnant Medicaid recipient and health care providers who challenged the Hyde Amendment. The United States Supreme Court vacated the injunction in August 1977, leading abortions financed by federal Medicaid to drop from 300,000 per year to a few thousand.<ref name=\":3\" /> Other bans were modeled after the Hyde Amendment, extending to other annual spending bills in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This eventually led federal funds to be banned in federal worker health plans, women in federal prisons, women in the military, peace corps volunteers, and international family planning programs that use non-U.S. funds to perform or advocate for abortion.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nThe Hyde Amendment has been reenacted every year since 1976, but exceptions have varied.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nFor example, the 1978 Amendment presented new exceptions for rape survivors and incest cases.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, in 1980, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the original Hyde Amendment language with a 5\u20134 vote in ''[[Harris v. McRae]]''. The majority found that the Hyde Amendment did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or due process/equal protection provided by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33467.pdf|title=Abortion: Judicial History and Legislative Response|last=Shimabukuro|first=Jon O.|date=October 13, 2016|website=Congressional Research Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  This case decided the single exception for the Amendment would be in cases where the woman's life is endangered. This decision was upheld from fiscal years 1981\u20131993.<ref name=\":3\" /> While the Supreme Court came close to reintroducing exceptions for cases of rape or incest in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services|Webster v. Reproductive Health Services of Missouri]]'', President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] succeeded in vetoing the bill despite an attempted House override.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>  This decision left the Amendment with the sole exception of concern being endangered life of the mother. The language was not altered until the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] in 1993. At this time, the Hyde Amendment was once again expanded to include exceptions for rape and incest cases.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLater in ''Williams v. Zbaraz'' (1980), the United States Supreme Court upheld that states could constitutionally make their own versions of the Hyde Amendment,<ref name=\":3\" /> and states/the federal government have no statutory or constitutional obligation to fund elective abortions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCurrently, 17 states extend abortion coverage to women enrolled in Medicaid through their own budgets, and 6 states extend abortion coverage when a woman's health is at risk. The remainder of the country abides by the Hyde Amendment.
