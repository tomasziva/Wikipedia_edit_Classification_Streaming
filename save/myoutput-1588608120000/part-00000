The sophons have also blocked all further research into particle physics, thus stopping any further human scientific development of fundamental principles, leaving only recombination and elaboration of existing technologies. Trisolaris orbits three stars and due to the nature of the [[Three-body problem|three body problem]] will eventually fall into one of the stars; thus, Trisolaris seeks to colonize Earth for themselves. An invasion fleet has been launched which will arrive at Earth in 400 years.\n\n===Prologue===\nWhile visiting the grave of a colleague, [[Sociology|sociologist]] Luo Ji runs into Ye Wenjie, the ailing spiritual leader of the Earth Trisolaris Organization. Due to his [[astronomy]] background, she suggests to him a new field of Cosmic Sociology based on two axioms she had been thinking of: (1) survival is the primary need of civilization, and (2) civilization continuously grows and expands, yet the total matter in the universe remains constant. This meeting is tracked by the Trisolarans who deem the wildcard Luo Ji as a threat, for which they convey to ETO.\n\nMeanwhile Evans, in his last communication, discovers that despite their advanced technology, the Trisolarans are incapable of [[internal monologue]]. They communicate via transmission of their thoughts directly into the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], visible even at a distance. Thinking is synonymous with speaking to them. This revelation frightens the Trisolarans, who cut off all contact with Evans and abandon the ETO. \n\nA military operation by world governments, detailed in the [[The Three-Body Problem (novel)|first novel]], subsequently kills everyone on board Evans' warship and retrieves the information of his contacts with the Trisolarans, including their plans to invade Earth, as well as to track and remove Luo Ji, setting the foundation for the UN's Wallfacer project thereafter.\n\n===Part I: The Wallfacers===\nSince the human mind is the only place the Trisolarans cannot see, the [[United Nations]] selects four men to be \"Wallfacers\", the keepers of plans known only to themselves, who are granted full access to the resources of the UN. In response, the Trisolarans revive the remnants of the ETO, tasking them with determining the plans of the Wallfacers. These ETO agents subsequently become what are referred to as the \"Wallbreakers.\" Research and development of any means of escape from the solar system is banned due to supporting Defeatism, as well as against the values of humanity due to most of the initial plans solely benefiting the highest socioeconomic strata of humanity.\n\nLuo Ji initially survives being narrowly crushed by a car accident that instead kills an uninterested lover. He is brought to the UN meeting by security forces where he attempts to refuse his Wallfacer status. He is injured shortly afterward by another assassin with a gun, and discovers that his refusal of his Wallfacer status is taken to be part of his plan. Resigned to his fate, Luo Ji demands to live in an isolated mansion where he begins a hedonistic lifestyle and has the woman of his dreams brought to him, whom he eventually marries.\n\nWallfacer Frederick Tyler embarks on a campaign to create an army of [[Kamikaze|Kamikaze]] fighter pilots to staff a swarm of fighters carrying [[hydrogen bombs]] to attack the fleet. Finding no luck in the Japanese, who are disdainful of their history being put to use, nor in a guerilla force in [[Afghanistan]], who have no hatred for Trisolaris due to the guaranteed destruction of the [[United States]] in the war, he orders the implementation of drone control in the fighter craft as well as research into planetary bodies with significant bodies of water.\n\nWallfacer Manuel Rey Diaz, in the meantime, orders research and development into supermassive hydrogen bombs. Due to the scale of the bombs, their mechanics are comparable to the physics of stars, so he recruits astronomers to assist in their development and shortly after develops a severe case of [[heliophobia]].\n\nWallfacer Bill Hines, in the meantime, initiates research into the human brain, with the hope that if a way to boost human intelligence is discovered, humanity might be able to brute force its way past the scientific block placed by the Sophons. He thus orders research into [[Computer architecture|traditional]], [[Quantum computing|quantum]], [[Biomechanical computers|biomechanical]], and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] supercomputers in order to further his research before entering [[hibernation]].\n\nMeanwhile, Zhang Beihai, a political officer in the [[Chinese Navy]], is tasked with laying down the foundations of Humanity's space force. He is a steadfast Triumphalist, believing that humanity will defeat the Trisolaran fleet. After seeing off his dying father, he develops a long private plan for how humanity will defeat Trisolaris and puts it into action.\n\n===Part II: The Spell===\nFrederick Tyler's plan is revealed by his Wallbreaker. His plan was to utilize the [[Swarming (military)|swarm fleet]] to destroy the human fleet, then transport a significant amount of water to the Trisolaran fleet, which, believing in the sincerity of the swarm [[Treason|turncoats]], would allow the swarm to approach close enough upon which Tyler would take manual control of the swarm and crash their hydrogen bomb payloads directly into the Trisolaran fleet ships. His plan now revealed along with the information that the Trisolarans have ignored it, Tyler falls into despair, exacerbated by the rest of the world believing the plan's revelation to be part of a bigger secret plan. After a meeting with Luo Ji, he commits suicide to finally be free of his Wallfacer status.\n\nManuel Rey Diaz's Wallbreaker reveals himself and explains that his heliophobia is a ruse intended to distract from his true focus on the Sun. His plan was to slow down the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] with his hydrogen bombs, pushing it into the Sun and causing a chain reaction in which the sun's surface continuously expands to swallow up more planets in the solar system, thus denying Earth to the Trisolarans but obviously destroying all of humanity in the process. At a UN meeting to hold him accountable for crimes against humanity, he blackmails the Wallfacer committee by threatening to set off secreted nuclear bombs within the city with a biometric watch on his wrist, demanding a revocation of his Wallfacer status and free leave to his home country of [[Venezuela]]. Upon arrival in Venezuela, it is revealed that the bombs planted within the city did not actually exist, but despite his escape he is promptly stoned to death by his people for his plan to place them in harm's way.\n\nEventually, the UN kidnaps Luo Ji's wife and child, putting them in hibernation until the Trisolaran fleet arrives as a means of goading him to get to work. It is finally revealed to him that he is the only human Trisolaris wants dead, and their initial attempts to discreetly kill him imply that whatever fear they have of him is a weapon that can be shared with other humans. He begins his work as a Wallfacer, asking questions about how to transmit the information about the position of a certain star in the [[Milky Way]] to a potential third observer civilization. This causes the Trisolarans to become truly afraid of Luo Ji, and they redouble their efforts to kill him.\n\nResearch into more advanced supercomputers fails, with only a modest improvement in traditional architecture, but it is enough to allow Bill Hines to image the entire human brain and all its neurons. Through his work, he and his wife Keiko Yamasuki accidentally discover a method of implanting an unbreakable belief into a human. He thus changes his plan to implanting Triumphalism into humanity's armed forces, and enters hibernation along with his wife until the doomsday battle.\n\nZhang Beihai visits a rock collector to purchase [[Meteorite|meteorites]]. Certain propulsion researchers are advocating for [[Reaction engine|medium drives]] in the space force, which require ships to carry two-thirds of their weight in fuel. Believing that this will severely handicap the human fleet, he assassinates said researchers with bullets made from the meteorites during a space walk photoshoot on a space elevator. Zhang Beihai points out the possibility that Defeatism and Triumphalism might wax and wane in the population over the coming centuries, and a situation might occur where humanity's armed forces are depleted of any hope before the coming battle. His superiors, to counter this potential scenario, select several political officers including Zhang Beihai to enter hibernation in order to reinforce the future space force with Triumphalist soldiers. The ETO, having observed his actions, are worried about him. However, Trisolaris is unconcerned with Triumphalism and is much more worried about Defeatist humans.\n\nLuo Ji uses the solar amplification technique to send out three images that show the relative position of star 187J3X1 in the universe. He says that it is a \"spell against the planets of star 187J3X1\", which will take one hundred years to be verified, as the star system is roughly 50 light years from the Solar System. He predicts the effects of the spell will be catastrophic.\n\nThe Trisolarans' sympathizers on Earth nearly kill Luo Ji with a [[flu]]-like illness [[Ethnic bioweapon|targeted to his genome]] (like a biological [[Stuxnet]]), called the 'bed flu' (pun on [[Avian influenza|bird flu]]). Unable to be cured, Luo Ji is put into [[Cryopreservation|hibernation]] to await a future time when a cure can be found. In the meantime, astronomers detect the launching of probes from the Trisolaran fleet to reach Earth 50 years ahead of the main fleet, the haste to reach Earth coinciding with the exact moment that Luo Ji made his announcement to the UN to broadcast the spell against 187J3X1.\n\n===Part III: The Dark Forest===\nAlmost 200 years later, Luo Ji is awakened to discover a drastically changed world. He learns that in the decades following when he was put into hibernation, there was massive [[ecological collapse]] as a result of the total [[militarization]] of Earth, turning much of the surface into a [[Desertification|desert]] and reducing the human population to 3 billion people. In response, nation states excavated large caverns where hyper-technological [[arcology|arcological]] cities were established, and throughout the following century, human civilization not only recovered but was able to make sizeable technological leaps that allowed humankind to enter an era of optimism. Earth now has three large fleets of spaceships numbering in the thousands with bases across the Solar System, and they have become politically independent of Earth's governments to prevent mixing of the priorities of Earth's governments caring for their civilians and the Fleet governments combating Trisolaris. Each ship is a stellar class battleship capable of interstellar travel at 15% the speed of light and armed with laser weapons, [[Railgun|railguns]], and nuclear bombs. Citing the fleets' strength, humans collectively assume that they can win against the Trisolarans, with many even discussing the potential for future peace talks with the Trisolarans because of how little a chance they stand against humanity. Luo Ji and Bill Hines are taken to a meeting of Solar Fleet Joint Conference (a descendant of the United Nations, facilitating governance between fleet command and the Earth governments). Citing Frederick Tyler's suicide and the logistical impossibility of Manuel Rey Diaz's plan (not enough [[fissile material]] to achieve the results he envisioned), the Wallfacer Project is chalked up to early crisis [[hysteria]] and disbanded. There, Hines\u2019s plan is revealed by his own wife, secretly an ETO agent and his Wallbreaker. Hines was a Defeatist and an Escapist, and his mental seal, instead of implanting Triumphalist beliefs into human armed forces, instead implanted Defeatism. Several seals were made in secret by himself and given to implanted soldiers to spread and induct other soldiers into Defeatism. Hines had hoped that Defeatism operating in secret might open up the possibility for humanity to escape the Solar System and preserve the seed of humanity. Luo Ji, in the meantime, survives multiple assassination attempts from an ETO created computer virus and has to flee to a surface town with Da Shi, where there is less technology.\n\nWith the first Trisolaran probe fast approaching the Solar System, Zhang Beihai is reawakened and given the position of acting captain of the flagship ''Natural Selection'' due to the possibility of fleet members being imprinted by Hines's mental seal. To everyone's shock, he uses his newfound authority to desert the Solar System to escape the Trisolarans' incoming fleet, revealing himself to be a secret Defeatist (but not imprinted with a mental seal) and his mission the entire time being to preserve the seed of humanity. Four other stellar class warships begin pursuit of ''Natural Selection''.\n\nThe Earth Fleet meets the Trisolaran probe in a massive formation of nearly all of Earth's starships. The probe, which appears to be a solid \"droplet\" of a mirror-like substance based on the [[strong interaction]], arrives and activates during its examination to suddenly attack the human fleet. The strong interaction force makes the droplet the strongest object in the Solar System, its mechanics far exceeding any technology known to humanity and allowing it to perform impossible maneuvers such as turning sharply at a single point to make a perfect 120\u00b0 change of course at high speed. These properties allow it to quickly smash through roughly 100 ships per minute as a result of the human fleet grid formation putting ships in ordered rows. Ship weapons are useless against it, and ships that attempt to accelerate beyond human safety limits are still caught and destroyed by the droplet. Only two ships survive the battle due to their crew being prepared for maximum acceleration in case the probe attempted to flee the fleet. The droplet, unharmed after destroying 2000 of humanity's ships, continues its journey towards Earth.\n\nThe surviving ships decide to escape the Solar System and head for nearby stars in hopes of founding civilization once again. However, the humans aboard these ships quickly realize there are only enough supplies for a single ship, as at their current speed it will take thousands of years to reach their destination. The distances between ships hinder sufficient communication to allow for a calm discussion between ships. In both the pair of ships that escaped the droplet's attack as well as the group of five ships that make up Natural Selection and the four other warships in pursuit of it, one crew initiates a [[first strike]] against the others to kill all crew onboard before collecting supplies and continuing their journey.\n\nWith the news of the annihilation of Earth's space fleet, humanity enters a state of hysteria and hopelessness. Luo Ji believes himself to be the ultimate target of the droplet; thus, in the few hours before the droplet strikes, he desperately tries to get in contact with the highest ranking leaders on Earth to elaborate on his plan from two centuries ago, believing that there is still hope for victory with his help. However, as he is now stripped of his Wallfacer status, Luo Ji finds that he does not have to authority to speak with Earth's leaders, causing him to resort to simply driving as far away from populated areas as he can so that the droplet will cause minimal damage to others. The droplet arrives, but to Luo Ji's surprise it flies past Earth and instead parks itself in a [[Lagrange point]] between the Earth and the Sun, where it broadcasts a powerful signal across all electromagnetic frequencies to prevent Earth from using the Sun's amplification mechanism again. At the same time, Earth's scientists, going through old records in their mad craze to find any useful information, discover that star 187J3X1 was destroyed 100 years ago. The revelation that Luo Ji's spell actually worked is quickly spread throughout the entire world, and the UN restores Luo Ji's Wallfacer status in response as Luo Ji finds himself treated as a Messiah figure. The reason his spell caused the destruction of the star rest on implications he derived from Ye Wenjie's two [[Axiom|axioms]] of cosmic civilization: (1) Each civilization's goal is survival, and (2) resources are finite. Like hunters in a \"[[Fermi paradox#It_is_dangerous_to_communicate|dark forest]]\", a civilization can never be certain of an alien civilization's true intentions. The extreme distances between stars creates an insurmountable \"chain of suspicion\", where any two civilizations cannot communicate well enough to dissipate distrust, making conflict inevitable. Leaving a \"primitive\" civilization alone is not an option due to the possibility of exponential technological progress, since a civilization detected may easily surpass another's technological level within a short period of time and become a threat. By detecting a civilization, the possibility of being detected by that civilization is also confirmed. Therefore, it is in every civilization's best interest to [[Fermi_paradox#It_is_the_nature_of_intelligent_life_to_destroy_others|preemptively strike and destroy]] any developing civilization before it can become a threat, but without revealing their own location to the wider universe, thus explaining the [[Fermi paradox]]. Because of this, the conclusion can be drawn that the photos of star 187J3X1's position in the galaxy were received by a third intelligent civilization that then destroyed the star system.\n\nDue to the droplet's scrambling signal, Luo Ji declares to the UN's successor organization that he is powerless to take any meaningful action because his plan relies on being able to use the Sun to broadcast signals out into the Milky Way, which is met with opposition. Eventually, Luo Ji reluctantly agrees to work on a government-given project in exchange for being able to see his wife and child again, who are still in hibernation. The project, named the \"Snow Project\", consists of organizing hydrogen bombs in a ring around the inner planets that, when exploded, will create a screen around the Solar System that will be able to detect when the other Trisolaran probes pass through it. As this is merely a futile project meant to inform humanity when the Trisolaran probes enter the Solar System rather than a productive plan to spring humanity towards victory, Luo Ji is shunned by the public since it is clear his Wallfacer authority is simply being used to carry out a government project. In the following three years, Luo Ji dedicates himself to the project, but descends into [[alcoholism]] as he faces animosity from the rest of the world, and one day he even finds himself getting kicked out of his own residence by his town. A shell of his former self, Luo Ji travels to the grave of Ye Wenjie, the woman who sent humanity's first message to Trisolaris and who told Luo Ji about the axioms of cosmic sociology. There, he digs his own grave and places a pistol to his heart. He then unexpectedly calls out to Trisolaris to issue an ultimatum: he is wearing a biometric watch as a [[dead-man's switch]] similar to one used by Rey Diaz two centuries ago, and has positioned the bombs of the Snow Project such that when exploded, the screen of dust clouds from the explosion will cause the high-frequency bands from the Sun to flicker in a pattern that will broadcast a signal to the Milky Way containing the exact coordinates of Trisolaris and, by extension, Earth. Left with no choice, the Trisolarans surrender and alter the course of their fleet to bypass the Solar System, cease the blocking of the Sun as a transmission source, and agree to teach humanity how to manufacture [[gravitational wave]] transmitters.\n\n===Five Years Later===\nLuo Ji takes his family to visit the newest gravitational wave transmitter supported by [[anti-gravity]]. Humanity has already built two previous gravitational wave transmitters and all are being tasked with transmitting gravitational noise akin to that from natural space objects such as neutron stars and black holes. A sophon unfolds behind them, and the Trisolaran on the other end happens to be the exact operator who transmitted the warning to Earth that was received by Ye Wenjie in the first novel. The two discusses the concept of [[love]]: Luo Ji believed only humans were capable of it, but the Trisolaran operator explains that Trisolarans were capable of it but suppressed it due to it being unproductive in the development of their civilization. This, however, brings up the possibility that love may exist in other species in the universe, and thus it may be worth taking the risk to let them grow and develop. Luo Ji brings up his hope that eventually a bright sun will illuminate the entire dark forest.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Ye Wenjie (\u53f6\u6587\u6d01) \u2013 Astrophysicist who initiated initial contact between Earth and Trisolaris.

The sophons have also blocked all further research into particle physics, thus stopping any further human scientific development of fundamental principles, leaving only recombination and elaboration of existing technologies. Trisolaris orbits three stars and due to the nature of the [[Three-body problem|three body problem]] will eventually fall into one of the stars; thus, Trisolaris seeks to colonize Earth for themselves. An invasion fleet has been launched which will arrive at Earth in 400 years.\n\n===Prologue===\nWhile visiting the grave of a colleague, [[Sociology|sociologist]] Luo Ji runs into Ye Wenjie, the ailing spiritual leader of the Earth Trisolaris Organization. Due to his [[astronomy]] background, she suggests to him a new field of Cosmic Sociology based on two axioms she had been thinking of: (1) survival is the primary need of civilization, and (2) civilization continuously grows and expands, yet the total matter in the universe remains constant. This meeting is tracked by the Trisolarans who deem the wildcard Luo Ji as a threat, for which they convey to ETO.\n\nMeanwhile Evans, in his last communication, discovers that despite their advanced technology, the Trisolarans are incapable of [[internal monologue]]. They communicate via transmission of their thoughts directly into the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], visible even at a distance. Thinking is synonymous with speaking to them. This revelation frightens the Trisolarans, who cut off all contact with Evans and abandon the ETO. \n\nA military operation by world governments, detailed in the [[The Three-Body Problem (novel)|first novel]], subsequently kills everyone on board Evans' warship and retrieves the information of his contacts with the Trisolarans, including their plan to invade Earth, as well as their plans to track and remove Luo Ji, setting the foundation for the UN's Wallfacer project thereafter.\n\n===Part I: The Wallfacers===\nSince the human mind is the only place the Trisolarans cannot see, the [[United Nations]] selects four men to be \"Wallfacers\", the keepers of plans known only to themselves, who are granted full access to the resources of the UN. In response, the Trisolarans revive the remnants of the ETO, tasking them with determining the plans of the Wallfacers. These ETO agents subsequently become what are referred to as the \"Wallbreakers.\" Research and development of any means of escape from the solar system is banned due to supporting Defeatism, as well as against the values of humanity due to most of the initial plans solely benefiting the highest socioeconomic strata of humanity.\n\nLuo Ji initially survives being narrowly crushed by a car accident that instead kills an uninterested lover. He is brought to the UN meeting by security forces where he attempts to refuse his Wallfacer status. He is injured shortly afterward by another assassin with a gun, and discovers that his refusal of his Wallfacer status is taken to be part of his plan. Resigned to his fate, Luo Ji demands to live in an isolated mansion where he begins a hedonistic lifestyle and has the woman of his dreams brought to him, whom he eventually marries.\n\nWallfacer Frederick Tyler embarks on a campaign to create an army of [[Kamikaze|Kamikaze]] fighter pilots to staff a swarm of fighters carrying [[hydrogen bombs]] to attack the fleet. Finding no luck in the Japanese, who are disdainful of their history being put to use, nor in a guerilla force in [[Afghanistan]], who have no hatred for Trisolaris due to the guaranteed destruction of the [[United States]] in the war, he orders the implementation of drone control in the fighter craft as well as research into planetary bodies with significant bodies of water.\n\nWallfacer Manuel Rey Diaz, in the meantime, orders research and development into supermassive hydrogen bombs. Due to the scale of the bombs, their mechanics are comparable to the physics of stars, so he recruits astronomers to assist in their development and shortly after develops a severe case of [[heliophobia]].\n\nWallfacer Bill Hines, in the meantime, initiates research into the human brain, with the hope that if a way to boost human intelligence is discovered, humanity might be able to brute force its way past the scientific block placed by the Sophons. He thus orders research into [[Computer architecture|traditional]], [[Quantum computing|quantum]], [[Biomechanical computers|biomechanical]], and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] supercomputers in order to further his research before entering [[hibernation]].\n\nMeanwhile, Zhang Beihai, a political officer in the [[Chinese Navy]], is tasked with laying down the foundations of Humanity's space force. He is a steadfast Triumphalist, believing that humanity will defeat the Trisolaran fleet. After seeing off his dying father, he develops a long private plan for how humanity will defeat Trisolaris and puts it into action.\n\n===Part II: The Spell===\nFrederick Tyler's plan is revealed by his Wallbreaker. His plan was to utilize the [[Swarming (military)|swarm fleet]] to destroy the human fleet, then transport a significant amount of water to the Trisolaran fleet, which, believing in the sincerity of the swarm [[Treason|turncoats]], would allow the swarm to approach close enough upon which Tyler would take manual control of the swarm and crash their hydrogen bomb payloads directly into the Trisolaran fleet ships. His plan now revealed along with the information that the Trisolarans have ignored it, Tyler falls into despair, exacerbated by the rest of the world believing the plan's revelation to be part of a bigger secret plan. After a meeting with Luo Ji, he commits suicide to finally be free of his Wallfacer status.\n\nManuel Rey Diaz's Wallbreaker reveals himself and explains that his heliophobia is a ruse intended to distract from his true focus on the Sun. His plan was to slow down the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] with his hydrogen bombs, pushing it into the Sun and causing a chain reaction in which the sun's surface continuously expands to swallow up more planets in the solar system, thus denying Earth to the Trisolarans but obviously destroying all of humanity in the process. At a UN meeting to hold him accountable for crimes against humanity, he blackmails the Wallfacer committee by threatening to set off secreted nuclear bombs within the city with a biometric watch on his wrist, demanding a revocation of his Wallfacer status and free leave to his home country of [[Venezuela]]. Upon arrival in Venezuela, it is revealed that the bombs planted within the city did not actually exist, but despite his escape he is promptly stoned to death by his people for his plan to place them in harm's way.\n\nEventually, the UN kidnaps Luo Ji's wife and child, putting them in hibernation until the Trisolaran fleet arrives as a means of goading him to get to work. It is finally revealed to him that he is the only human Trisolaris wants dead, and their initial attempts to discreetly kill him imply that whatever fear they have of him is a weapon that can be shared with other humans. He begins his work as a Wallfacer, asking questions about how to transmit the information about the position of a certain star in the [[Milky Way]] to a potential third observer civilization. This causes the Trisolarans to become truly afraid of Luo Ji, and they redouble their efforts to kill him.\n\nResearch into more advanced supercomputers fails, with only a modest improvement in traditional architecture, but it is enough to allow Bill Hines to image the entire human brain and all its neurons. Through his work, he and his wife Keiko Yamasuki accidentally discover a method of implanting an unbreakable belief into a human. He thus changes his plan to implanting Triumphalism into humanity's armed forces, and enters hibernation along with his wife until the doomsday battle.\n\nZhang Beihai visits a rock collector to purchase [[Meteorite|meteorites]]. Certain propulsion researchers are advocating for [[Reaction engine|medium drives]] in the space force, which require ships to carry two-thirds of their weight in fuel. Believing that this will severely handicap the human fleet, he assassinates said researchers with bullets made from the meteorites during a space walk photoshoot on a space elevator. Zhang Beihai points out the possibility that Defeatism and Triumphalism might wax and wane in the population over the coming centuries, and a situation might occur where humanity's armed forces are depleted of any hope before the coming battle. His superiors, to counter this potential scenario, select several political officers including Zhang Beihai to enter hibernation in order to reinforce the future space force with Triumphalist soldiers. The ETO, having observed his actions, are worried about him. However, Trisolaris is unconcerned with Triumphalism and is much more worried about Defeatist humans.\n\nLuo Ji uses the solar amplification technique to send out three images that show the relative position of star 187J3X1 in the universe. He says that it is a \"spell against the planets of star 187J3X1\", which will take one hundred years to be verified, as the star system is roughly 50 light years from the Solar System. He predicts the effects of the spell will be catastrophic.\n\nThe Trisolarans' sympathizers on Earth nearly kill Luo Ji with a [[flu]]-like illness [[Ethnic bioweapon|targeted to his genome]] (like a biological [[Stuxnet]]), called the 'bed flu' (pun on [[Avian influenza|bird flu]]). Unable to be cured, Luo Ji is put into [[Cryopreservation|hibernation]] to await a future time when a cure can be found. In the meantime, astronomers detect the launching of probes from the Trisolaran fleet to reach Earth 50 years ahead of the main fleet, the haste to reach Earth coinciding with the exact moment that Luo Ji made his announcement to the UN to broadcast the spell against 187J3X1.\n\n===Part III: The Dark Forest===\nAlmost 200 years later, Luo Ji is awakened to discover a drastically changed world. He learns that in the decades following when he was put into hibernation, there was massive [[ecological collapse]] as a result of the total [[militarization]] of Earth, turning much of the surface into a [[Desertification|desert]] and reducing the human population to 3 billion people. In response, nation states excavated large caverns where hyper-technological [[arcology|arcological]] cities were established, and throughout the following century, human civilization not only recovered but was able to make sizeable technological leaps that allowed humankind to enter an era of optimism. Earth now has three large fleets of spaceships numbering in the thousands with bases across the Solar System, and they have become politically independent of Earth's governments to prevent mixing of the priorities of Earth's governments caring for their civilians and the Fleet governments combating Trisolaris. Each ship is a stellar class battleship capable of interstellar travel at 15% the speed of light and armed with laser weapons, [[Railgun|railguns]], and nuclear bombs. Citing the fleets' strength, humans collectively assume that they can win against the Trisolarans, with many even discussing the potential for future peace talks with the Trisolarans because of how little a chance they stand against humanity. Luo Ji and Bill Hines are taken to a meeting of Solar Fleet Joint Conference (a descendant of the United Nations, facilitating governance between fleet command and the Earth governments). Citing Frederick Tyler's suicide and the logistical impossibility of Manuel Rey Diaz's plan (not enough [[fissile material]] to achieve the results he envisioned), the Wallfacer Project is chalked up to early crisis [[hysteria]] and disbanded. There, Hines\u2019s plan is revealed by his own wife, secretly an ETO agent and his Wallbreaker. Hines was a Defeatist and an Escapist, and his mental seal, instead of implanting Triumphalist beliefs into human armed forces, instead implanted Defeatism. Several seals were made in secret by himself and given to implanted soldiers to spread and induct other soldiers into Defeatism. Hines had hoped that Defeatism operating in secret might open up the possibility for humanity to escape the Solar System and preserve the seed of humanity. Luo Ji, in the meantime, survives multiple assassination attempts from an ETO created computer virus and has to flee to a surface town with Da Shi, where there is less technology.\n\nWith the first Trisolaran probe fast approaching the Solar System, Zhang Beihai is reawakened and given the position of acting captain of the flagship ''Natural Selection'' due to the possibility of fleet members being imprinted by Hines's mental seal. To everyone's shock, he uses his newfound authority to desert the Solar System to escape the Trisolarans' incoming fleet, revealing himself to be a secret Defeatist (but not imprinted with a mental seal) and his mission the entire time being to preserve the seed of humanity. Four other stellar class warships begin pursuit of ''Natural Selection''.\n\nThe Earth Fleet meets the Trisolaran probe in a massive formation of nearly all of Earth's starships. The probe, which appears to be a solid \"droplet\" of a mirror-like substance based on the [[strong interaction]], arrives and activates during its examination to suddenly attack the human fleet. The strong interaction force makes the droplet the strongest object in the Solar System, its mechanics far exceeding any technology known to humanity and allowing it to perform impossible maneuvers such as turning sharply at a single point to make a perfect 120\u00b0 change of course at high speed. These properties allow it to quickly smash through roughly 100 ships per minute as a result of the human fleet grid formation putting ships in ordered rows. Ship weapons are useless against it, and ships that attempt to accelerate beyond human safety limits are still caught and destroyed by the droplet. Only two ships survive the battle due to their crew being prepared for maximum acceleration in case the probe attempted to flee the fleet. The droplet, unharmed after destroying 2000 of humanity's ships, continues its journey towards Earth.\n\nThe surviving ships decide to escape the Solar System and head for nearby stars in hopes of founding civilization once again. However, the humans aboard these ships quickly realize there are only enough supplies for a single ship, as at their current speed it will take thousands of years to reach their destination. The distances between ships hinder sufficient communication to allow for a calm discussion between ships. In both the pair of ships that escaped the droplet's attack as well as the group of five ships that make up Natural Selection and the four other warships in pursuit of it, one crew initiates a [[first strike]] against the others to kill all crew onboard before collecting supplies and continuing their journey.\n\nWith the news of the annihilation of Earth's space fleet, humanity enters a state of hysteria and hopelessness. Luo Ji believes himself to be the ultimate target of the droplet; thus, in the few hours before the droplet strikes, he desperately tries to get in contact with the highest ranking leaders on Earth to elaborate on his plan from two centuries ago, believing that there is still hope for victory with his help. However, as he is now stripped of his Wallfacer status, Luo Ji finds that he does not have to authority to speak with Earth's leaders, causing him to resort to simply driving as far away from populated areas as he can so that the droplet will cause minimal damage to others. The droplet arrives, but to Luo Ji's surprise it flies past Earth and instead parks itself in a [[Lagrange point]] between the Earth and the Sun, where it broadcasts a powerful signal across all electromagnetic frequencies to prevent Earth from using the Sun's amplification mechanism again. At the same time, Earth's scientists, going through old records in their mad craze to find any useful information, discover that star 187J3X1 was destroyed 100 years ago. The revelation that Luo Ji's spell actually worked is quickly spread throughout the entire world, and the UN restores Luo Ji's Wallfacer status in response as Luo Ji finds himself treated as a Messiah figure. The reason his spell caused the destruction of the star rest on implications he derived from Ye Wenjie's two [[Axiom|axioms]] of cosmic civilization: (1) Each civilization's goal is survival, and (2) resources are finite. Like hunters in a \"[[Fermi paradox#It_is_dangerous_to_communicate|dark forest]]\", a civilization can never be certain of an alien civilization's true intentions. The extreme distances between stars creates an insurmountable \"chain of suspicion\", where any two civilizations cannot communicate well enough to dissipate distrust, making conflict inevitable. Leaving a \"primitive\" civilization alone is not an option due to the possibility of exponential technological progress, since a civilization detected may easily surpass another's technological level within a short period of time and become a threat. By detecting a civilization, the possibility of being detected by that civilization is also confirmed. Therefore, it is in every civilization's best interest to [[Fermi_paradox#It_is_the_nature_of_intelligent_life_to_destroy_others|preemptively strike and destroy]] any developing civilization before it can become a threat, but without revealing their own location to the wider universe, thus explaining the [[Fermi paradox]]. Because of this, the conclusion can be drawn that the photos of star 187J3X1's position in the galaxy were received by a third intelligent civilization that then destroyed the star system.\n\nDue to the droplet's scrambling signal, Luo Ji declares to the UN's successor organization that he is powerless to take any meaningful action because his plan relies on being able to use the Sun to broadcast signals out into the Milky Way, which is met with opposition. Eventually, Luo Ji reluctantly agrees to work on a government-given project in exchange for being able to see his wife and child again, who are still in hibernation. The project, named the \"Snow Project\", consists of organizing hydrogen bombs in a ring around the inner planets that, when exploded, will create a screen around the Solar System that will be able to detect when the other Trisolaran probes pass through it. As this is merely a futile project meant to inform humanity when the Trisolaran probes enter the Solar System rather than a productive plan to spring humanity towards victory, Luo Ji is shunned by the public since it is clear his Wallfacer authority is simply being used to carry out a government project. In the following three years, Luo Ji dedicates himself to the project, but descends into [[alcoholism]] as he faces animosity from the rest of the world, and one day he even finds himself getting kicked out of his own residence by his town. A shell of his former self, Luo Ji travels to the grave of Ye Wenjie, the woman who sent humanity's first message to Trisolaris and who told Luo Ji about the axioms of cosmic sociology. There, he digs his own grave and places a pistol to his heart. He then unexpectedly calls out to Trisolaris to issue an ultimatum: he is wearing a biometric watch as a [[dead-man's switch]] similar to one used by Rey Diaz two centuries ago, and has positioned the bombs of the Snow Project such that when exploded, the screen of dust clouds from the explosion will cause the high-frequency bands from the Sun to flicker in a pattern that will broadcast a signal to the Milky Way containing the exact coordinates of Trisolaris and, by extension, Earth. Left with no choice, the Trisolarans surrender and alter the course of their fleet to bypass the Solar System, cease the blocking of the Sun as a transmission source, and agree to teach humanity how to manufacture [[gravitational wave]] transmitters.\n\n===Five Years Later===\nLuo Ji takes his family to visit the newest gravitational wave transmitter supported by [[anti-gravity]]. Humanity has already built two previous gravitational wave transmitters and all are being tasked with transmitting gravitational noise akin to that from natural space objects such as neutron stars and black holes. A sophon unfolds behind them, and the Trisolaran on the other end happens to be the exact operator who transmitted the warning to Earth that was received by Ye Wenjie in the first novel. The two discusses the concept of [[love]]: Luo Ji believed only humans were capable of it, but the Trisolaran operator explains that Trisolarans were capable of it but suppressed it due to it being unproductive in the development of their civilization. This, however, brings up the possibility that love may exist in other species in the universe, and thus it may be worth taking the risk to let them grow and develop. Luo Ji brings up his hope that eventually a bright sun will illuminate the entire dark forest.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Ye Wenjie (\u53f6\u6587\u6d01) \u2013 Astrophysicist who initiated initial contact between Earth and Trisolaris.
