Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [[grain elevator]]. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [[artesian well]]s. Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.\n\n===Front Range===\n\n[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]\n\nRoughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The \"Front Range\" includes Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Loveland, Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in Western Colorado (which is not considered the \"Front Range\") are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]].\n\n===Continental Divide===\n\n[[File:Continental-Divide Monarch-Pass 2012-10-28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at [[Monarch Pass]]]]\n\nThe [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].\n\nWithin the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.\n\n===Southern region===\n\n\nIn southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.\n[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]\n\n[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America, at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]]]]\n\n===Peaks===\n\n{{main|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}\n\nTo the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]\n\nThe Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this tree line only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year-round.\n\nMuch of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.\n[[File:BlackCanyon.JPG|thumb|[[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]] near [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]]]]\n[[File:East rim arch.jpg|thumb|left|Rim Arch in the [[Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness]] in western Colorado]]\n[[File:Redcanyon.JPG|thumb|left|Sandstone cliffs along the Colorado River north of [[Wolcott, Colorado|Wolcott]]]]\n[[File:Lake CO.JPG|thumb|[[Hanging Lake]] near [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]]]]\n\n===Colorado Western Slope===\n\n[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The city of Grand Junction, in the heart of The Grand Valley]]\n\nThe Western Slope area of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the state to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west of the mountains. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.\n\nFrom west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger|pid=5689|name=Pikes Peak, Colorado|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref> The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which not only is a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado. Desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].\n\nThe Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Gunnison River]], [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]], and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located. Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah.\n[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.]]\n[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]]. [[Ute Mountain]] is in the distance.]]\n\n[[Grand Junction, Colorado]] is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway in Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.\n\nThe Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].\n\nHigher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western Colorado University]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.\n\nThe [[Four Corners Monument]] in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]]; the only such place in the United States.\n{{See also|Colorado cities and towns|List of counties in Colorado|Colorado municipalities|Colorado rivers|Four Corners Monument}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\n\n[[File:Colorado K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Colorado]]\n\nThe [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.\n\nAs a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.\n\n===Eastern Plains===\n\nThe climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|abbr=off|mm|sp=us}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [[rain shadow|precipitation shadow]] as a result of being on the [[Leeward|lee]] side of the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"usgsFRUC1978\">{{cite report |last=Hansen |first=Wallace R. |last2=Chronic |first2=John |last3=Matelock |first3=John |date=1979|orig-year=first published 1978|title=Climatography of the Front Range Urban Corridor and vicinity, Colorado |work=Geological Survey Professional Paper 1019|publisher=USG Printing Office|place=Washington, DC |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn summer, this area can have many days above 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) and often 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"Climate of Colorado\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |title=Climate of Colorado |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22124 to \u221223&nbsp;\u00b0C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[Chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher in the winter.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\" /> The average July temperature is 55&nbsp;\u00b0F (13&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 48&nbsp;\u00b0F (9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n===Front range foothills===\n\nJust west of the plains and into the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [[alpine climate]] at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (''Cfb/Cwb''), humid subtropical (''Cfa''), humid continental (''Dfa/Dfb''), Mediterranean (''Csa/Csb'') and subarctic (''Dfc'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |title=Relocating to Greenhorn Valley |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525090433/http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Extreme weather===\n\n[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains]]\n\nExtreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state.

The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River]], the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.\n\nWater flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.\n\n===Records===\n\nThe highest official ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was {{convert|115|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}} on July 20, 2019, at [[John Martin Reservoir|John Martin Dam]].

The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the valleys and mesas of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>\"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]\", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].\n[[File:La conquista del Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] discovering Colorado in 1540, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]. [[Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas]] can be seen overlooking the [[Grand Canyon]].]]\n\nThe Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to U.S. involvement in the region. The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa F\u00e9 de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.\n\nThe U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Missouri|state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835\u201336 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.\n[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Mexican Cession]], with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the [[Republic of Texas]]) after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]\n\nMost American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].\n[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]\n\nIn 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.\n\nThe gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.\n\n===Territory act===\n\n{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Colorado Territory}}\n[[File:1860 colorado territory map.png|thumb|left|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]]]]\n\nThirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.<ref name=Colorado_River>Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentatively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.</ref> In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Multiple Property Documentation Form |title=National-Register-of-Historic |url=https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> In 1859, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa F\u00e9, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt.

While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.\n\nIn 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Blood & treasure : Confederate Empire in the Southwest|last=Frazier |first=Donald Shaw |date=1995|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|isbn=0585303304|edition=1st|location=College Station|oclc=45732362}}</ref> The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.\n\nIn 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].\n[[File:Mount of the Holy Cross.jpeg|thumb|[[Mount of the Holy Cross]], photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1874]]\n\nIn the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to Weir, now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Georgetown loop 1899.jpg|thumb|The [[Georgetown Loop]] of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]] as photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1899]]\n\nThe [[Forty-third United States Congress|United States Congress]] passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the [[Territory of Colorado]] to become a state.<ref name=ColoradoEnablingAct>{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/PROCEEDINGS%20OF%20THE%20CONSTITUTIONAL%20CONVENTION_0.pdf|title=An Act to Enable the People of Colorado to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the Admission of the Said State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States |format=PDF |author=Forty-third United States Congress |author-link=Forty-third United States Congress |date=March 3, 1875|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref> On August 1, 1876 (four weeks after the [[Centennial of the United States]]), U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum|popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD) operates the popular [[RTD Bus & Rail]] transit system in the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]]. {{as of|2013|January|}} the RTD rail system had 170 light-rail vehicles, serving {{convert|47|mi|km}} of track.\n[[File:California Zephyr--Eastbound meets Westbound in Glenwood Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|The westbound and eastbound ''[[California Zephyr]]s'' meet in the [[Glenwood Canyon]].]] \n\n[[Amtrak]] operates two passenger rail lines in Colorado, the [[California Zephyr]] and [[Southwest Chief]]. Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the \"Rio Grande\" acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.\n\nColorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606044205/https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |archivedate=June 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\nIn August 2014, Colorado began to issue driver licenses to [[Alien (law)|aliens]] [[Illegal immigration to the United States|not lawfully in the United States]] who lived in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nicholson |first=Kieran |date=August 1, 2014 |title=Immigrants here illegally begin receiving Colorado driver licenses |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26257608/immigrants-here-illegally-begin-receiving-colorado-driver-licenses |newspaper=Denver Post |access-date=August 1, 2014}}</ref> In September 2014, [[KCNC]] reported that 524 non-citizens were issued Colorado driver licenses that are normally issued to U.S. citizens living in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --> |title=524 Non-Citizens Received Regular Colorado Driver's Licenses, DMV Says |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/09/12/524-non-citizens-received-regular-colorado-drivers-licenses-dmv-says/ |newspaper=KCNC |location=Denver |date=September 12, 2014 |access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n\n{{Main|Government of Colorado}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n! colspan = 6 | State Executive Officers\n|-\n!| Office\n!

These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.\n\nSome of these districts have authority to levy sales tax and well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.\n\nSome of the more notable Colorado districts are:\n* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties\n* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties\n** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).\n** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.\n** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three \"tiers\" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.\n*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.\n*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.\n*** Tier III has more than 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.\n** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.\n* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]\n* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties\n* The Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District, approved by voters to pay for and help build the [[Colorado Rockies]]' stadium [[Coors Field]]\n* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County\n\n==Politics==\n\n{{Main|Politics of Colorado}}\n{{See also|Political party strength in Colorado|United States presidential elections in Colorado}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | Colorado registered voters {{as of|2016|April|1|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VoterRegNumbers/2016/March/VotersByPartyStatus.pdf|title=Total Registered Voters By Party Affiliation and Status As of Fri Apr 01 2016 03:07:45 GMT-0600 (MDT)|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, voting for the Democratic candidate only in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nColorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.\n\nColorado is represented by two [[United States Senate|United States Senators]]:\n* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 2]], [[Cory Gardner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015\u2013\n* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 3]], [[Michael Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009\u2013\nColorado is represented by seven [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]], [[Diana DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 1997\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]], [[Joe Neguse]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019-\n* [[Colorado's 3rd congressional district]], [[Scott Tipton]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2011\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 4th congressional district]], [[Ken Buck]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 5th congressional district]], [[Doug Lamborn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2007\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]], [[Jason Crow]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 7th congressional district]], [[Ed Perlmutter]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2007\u2013\n\n===Significant bills passed in Colorado===\n\nOn the November 8, 1932 ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified.\n\nIn 2012, voters amended the state constitution protecting [[Colorado Amendment 64|\"personal use\" of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a manner similar to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.<ref name=Healy/>\n\nOn May 29, 2019, Governor [[Jared Polis]] signed

Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [[grain elevator]]. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [[artesian well]]s. Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.\n\n===Front Range===\n\n[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]\n\nRoughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The \"Front Range\" includes Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Loveland, Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in Western Colorado (which is not considered the \"Front Range\") are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]].\n\n===Continental Divide===\n\n[[File:Continental-Divide Monarch-Pass 2012-10-28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at [[Monarch Pass]]]]\n\nThe [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].\n\nWithin the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.\n\n===Southern region===\n\n\nIn southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.\n[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]\n\n[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America, at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]]]]\n\n===Peaks===\n\n{{main|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}\n\nTo the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]\n\nThe Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this tree line only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year-round.\n\nMuch of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.\n[[File:BlackCanyon.JPG|thumb|[[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]] near [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]]]]\n[[File:East rim arch.jpg|thumb|left|Rim Arch in the [[Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness]] in western Colorado]]\n[[File:Redcanyon.JPG|thumb|left|Sandstone cliffs along the Colorado River north of [[Wolcott, Colorado|Wolcott]]]]\n[[File:Lake CO.JPG|thumb|[[Hanging Lake]] near [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]]]]\n\n===Colorado Western Slope===\n\n[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The city of Grand Junction, in the heart of The Grand Valley]]\n\nThe Western Slope area of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the state to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west of the mountains. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.\n\nFrom west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger|pid=5689|name=Pikes Peak, Colorado|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref> The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which not only is a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado. Desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].\n\nThe Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Gunnison River]], [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]], and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located. Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah.\n[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.]]\n[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]]. [[Ute Mountain]] is in the distance.]]\n\n[[Grand Junction, Colorado]] is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway in Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.\n\nThe Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].\n\nHigher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western Colorado University]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.\n\nThe [[Four Corners Monument]] in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]]; the only such place in the United States.\n{{See also|Colorado cities and towns|List of counties in Colorado|Colorado municipalities|Colorado rivers|Four Corners Monument}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\n\n[[File:Colorado K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Colorado]]\n\nThe [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.\n\nAs a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.\n\n===Eastern Plains===\n\nThe climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|abbr=off|mm|sp=us}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [[rain shadow|precipitation shadow]] as a result of being on the [[Leeward|lee]] side of the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"usgsFRUC1978\">{{cite report |last=Hansen |first=Wallace R. |last2=Chronic |first2=John |last3=Matelock |first3=John |date=1979|orig-year=first published 1978|title=Climatography of the Front Range Urban Corridor and vicinity, Colorado |work=Geological Survey Professional Paper 1019|publisher=USG Printing Office|place=Washington, DC |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn summer, this area can have many days above 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) and often 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"Climate of Colorado\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |title=Climate of Colorado |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22124 to \u221223&nbsp;\u00b0C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[Chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher in the winter.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\" /> The average July temperature is 55&nbsp;\u00b0F (13&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 48&nbsp;\u00b0F (9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n===Front range foothills===\n\nJust west of the plains and into the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [[alpine climate]] at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (''Cfb/Cwb''), humid subtropical (''Cfa''), humid continental (''Dfa/Dfb''), Mediterranean (''Csa/Csb'') and subarctic (''Dfc'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |title=Relocating to Greenhorn Valley |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525090433/http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Extreme weather===\n\n[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains]]\n\nExtreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern Plains, especially the northeast part of the state.

The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the valleys and mesas of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>\"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]\", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].\n[[File:La conquista del Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] discovering Colorado in 1540, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]. [[Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas]] can be seen overlooking the [[Grand Canyon]].]]\n\nThe Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to U.S. involvement in the region. The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa F\u00e9 de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.\n\nThe U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Missouri|state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835\u201336 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.\n[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Mexican Cession]], with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the [[Republic of Texas]]) after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]\n\nMost American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].\n[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]\n\nIn 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.\n\nThe gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.\n\n===Territory act===\n\n{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Colorado Territory}}\n[[File:1860 colorado territory map.png|thumb|left|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]]]]\n\nThirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments.

The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentatively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.</ref> In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Multiple Property Documentation Form |title=National-Register-of-Historic |url=https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> In 1859, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa F\u00e9, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt.

While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.\n\nIn 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Blood & treasure : Confederate Empire in the Southwest|last=Frazier |first=Donald Shaw |date=1995|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|isbn=0585303304|edition=1st|location=College Station|oclc=45732362}}</ref> The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.\n\nIn 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].\n[[File:Mount of the Holy Cross.jpeg|thumb|[[Mount of the Holy Cross]], photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1874]]\n\nIn the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to Weir, now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado.

Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum|popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.\n\nColorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606044205/https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |archivedate=June 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\nIn August 2014, Colorado began to issue driver licenses to [[Alien (law)|aliens]] [[Illegal immigration to the United States|not lawfully in the United States]] who lived in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nicholson |first=Kieran |date=August 1, 2014 |title=Immigrants here illegally begin receiving Colorado driver licenses |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26257608/immigrants-here-illegally-begin-receiving-colorado-driver-licenses |newspaper=Denver Post |access-date=August 1, 2014}}</ref> In September 2014, [[KCNC]] reported that 524 non-citizens were issued Colorado driver licenses that are normally issued to U.S. citizens living in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --> |title=524 Non-Citizens Received Regular Colorado Driver's Licenses, DMV Says |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/09/12/524-non-citizens-received-regular-colorado-drivers-licenses-dmv-says/ |newspaper=KCNC |location=Denver |date=September 12, 2014 |access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n\n{{Main|Government of Colorado}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n! colspan = 6 | State Executive Officers\n|-\n!| Office\n!

This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.\n\nSome of the more notable Colorado districts are:\n* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties\n* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties\n** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).\n** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.\n** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three \"tiers\" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.\n*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.\n*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.\n*** Tier III has more than 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.\n** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes.

Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, voting for the Democratic candidate only in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nColorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.\n\nColorado is represented by two [[United States Senate|United States Senators]]:\n* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 2]], [[Cory Gardner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015\u2013\n* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 3]], [[Michael Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009\u2013\nColorado is represented by seven [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]], [[Diana DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 1997\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]], [[Joe Neguse]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019-\n* [[Colorado's 3rd congressional district]], [[Scott Tipton]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2011\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 4th congressional district]], [[Ken Buck]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 5th congressional district]], [[Doug Lamborn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2007\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]], [[Jason Crow]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 7th congressional district]], [[Ed Perlmutter]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2007\u2013\n\n===Significant bills passed in Colorado===\n\nOn the November 8, 1932 ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified.\n\nIn 2012, voters amended the state constitution protecting [[Colorado Amendment 64|\"personal use\" of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a manner similar to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].
