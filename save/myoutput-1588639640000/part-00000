As a particularly dominant species, no efforts are directed toward conserving ''V. mandarinia'' or its habitats, as they are common in areas of low human disturbance. Unlike other species of ''Vespa'', ''V. mandarinia'' almost exclusively inhabits [[subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] nests. In a study of 31 nests, 25 were found around rotten pine roots. Additionally, rodents, snakes, or other [[burrowing animals]] previously made some of the tunnels. The depth of these nests was between 6 and 60&nbsp;cm. The entrance at the ground surface varies in length from 2 to 60&nbsp;cm either horizontally, inclined, or vertically. The queens that found the nest prefer narrow cavities.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\">{{cite journal|last=Matsuura|first=Makoto|last2=Sakagami|first2=Sh\u00f4ichi F.|date=October 1973|title=A Bionomic Sketch of the Giant Hornet, ''Vespa mandarinia'', a Serious Pest for Japanese Apiculture|url=https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/27557/1/19(1)_P125-162.pdf|url-status=live|journal=Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University|series=Series 6, Zoology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=125\u2013162|issn=0368-2188|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818210542/https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/27557/1/19(1)_P125-162.pdf|archive-date=18 August 2017|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nNests of ''Vespa'' typically lack a developed envelope. During the initial stages of development, the envelope is in an inverted-bowl shape. As the nest develops, one to three rough sheets of combs are created. Often, single [[wikt:primordial|primordial]] combs are created simultaneously and then fused into a single comb.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\nA system of one main pillar and secondary pillars connects the combs. Nests usually have four to seven combs. The top comb is abandoned after summer and left to rot. The largest comb is at the middle to bottom portion of the nest. The largest combs created by ''Vespa'' measured 49.5&nbsp;cm by 45.5&nbsp;cm with 1,192 cells (no obstacles, circular) and 61.0&nbsp;cm by 48.0&nbsp;cm (elliptical; wrapped around root system).<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n== Colony cycle ==\nThe nesting cycle of ''V. mandarinia'' is fairly consistent with that of other [[Eusociality|eusocial insects]]. Six phases occur in each cycle.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Prenesting period ===\nInseminated and uninseminated queens enter hibernation following a cycle. They first appear in early to mid-April and begin feeding on the sap of ''[[Quercus]]'' trees. Although this timing is consistent among hornets, ''V. mandarinia'' dominates the order, receiving preference for premium sap sources. Among the ''V. mandarinia'' queens is a [[dominance hierarchy]]. Top-ranked queens begin feeding, while the other queens form a circle around her. Once the top queen finishes, the second-highest ranking queen feeds. This process repeats until the last queen feeds at a poor hour.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Solitary, cooperative and polyethic periods ===\nInseminated queens start to search for nesting sites in late April. The uninseminated queens do not search for nests since their ovaries never fully develop. They continue to feed, but then disappear in early July.\n\nAn inseminated queen begins to create relatively small cells in which she raises around 40 small workers. Workers do not begin to work outside of the hive until July. Queens participate in activities outside the hive until mid-July when they stay inside the nest and allow workers to do extranidal activities. Early August marks a fully developed nest, containing three combs holding 500 cells and 100 workers. After mid-September, no more eggs are laid and the focus shifts to caring for larvae. The queens die in late October.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Dissolution and hibernating period ===\nMales and new queens take on their responsibilities in mid-September and mid-October, respectively. During this time, their body color becomes intense and the weight of the queen increases about 20%. Once the males and queen leave the nest, they do not return. In ''V. mandarinia'', males wait outside the nest entrance until the queen emerges. Once the queen emerges, they intercept her midair, bring her to the ground, and [[copulation (zoology)|copulate]] from 8 to 45 seconds. After this episode, the males return to the entrance for a second chance, while the queen leaves. Many queens attempt to fight off the males and leave unfertilized. After this episode, queens are found in moist, subterranean habitats.\n\nWhen sexed individuals emerge, workers shift their focus from protein and animal foods to carbohydrates. The last sexed individuals to emerge die of starvation.<ref name=\" Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n[[File:Vespa mandarinia japonica IMG 0214.JPG|thumb|An Asian giant hornet]]\n== Sting ==\nThe stinger of the Asian giant hornet is about {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} long,<ref name=\"ngeo\" /> and injects an especially potent [[venom]] that contains, like many bee and wasp venoms, a [[cytolysis|cytolytic]] [[peptide]] (specifically, a [[mastoparan]]) that can damage tissue by stimulating [[phospholipase]] action,<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" /> the stinger of the Asian giant hornet is about {{convert|4.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer than a traditional honeybee.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doumani|first=Beshara|issue=1987-05|title=We are Here to Stay|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3011869|journal=MERIP Middle East Report|issue=146|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3011869|issn=0888-0328}}</ref> In addition to its own phospholipase.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\nMasato Ono, an [[entomology|entomologist]] at [[Tamagawa University]] near Tokyo, described the sensation as feeling \"like a hot nail being driven into my leg\".<ref name=\"ngeo\" />\n\nThe venom contains a [[neurotoxin]] called mandaratoxin,<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" /> a single-chain [[polypeptide]] with a molecular weight around 20 [[kilodalton|kD]].<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" /> While a single wasp cannot inject a lethal dose, it can be lethal even to people who are not [[allergy|allergic]] if the dose is sufficient (i.e., if multiple stings are received).

People who weren't stung? Or is this comparing fatalities to non-fatalities? And two sentences later it says not everyone displayed necrosis, contradicting this. }} The two likely reasons for skin hemorrhaging and necrosis are an inability to effectively neutralize the venom, or unusually potent venom toxicity for that set of stings. In either case, these stings lead to multiple organ injury. While not everyone displayed lesions or necrosis, a strong correlation existed between the number of stings and the severity of injury. Those who died, on average, were stung 59 times (with a [[standard deviation]] of 12), while those who survived suffered 28 stings (with a standard deviation of 4).<ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Yanagawa\n| first      = Youichi\n| last2      = Morita\n| first2     = Kentaro\n| date       = 10 October 1980\n| title      = Cutaneous hemorrhage or necrosis findings after ''Vespa mandarinia'' (wasp) stings may predict the occurrence of multiple organ injury: A case report and review of literature\n| journal    = Clinical Toxicology\n| publisher  = Informa Healthcare USA\n| doi=10.1080/15563650701664871\n| pmid      = 17952752\n| volume=45\n| issue      = 7\n| pages=803\u2013807\n}}</ref>\n\n== Parasites ==\n''Xenos moutoni'' is a common parasite among ''Vespa'' species.

The width of the stylopid's head and the host's head are positively correlated. The major consequence of being parasitized is the inability to reproduce for the following year. Stylopized queens follow the same fate as uninseminated queens. They do not search for an area to create a new colony and feed on sap until early July, when they disappear. In other species of ''Vespa'', males also have a chance of being stylopized. The consequences between the two sexes are similar, as neither sex is able to reproduce.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last         = Makino\n | first        = Shun'ichi\n | last2        = Yamashita\n | first2       = Yoshiharu\n | date         = 25 December 1998\n | title        = Levels of Parasitism by ''Xenos moutoni'' du Buysson (Strepsiptera, Stylopidae) and their Seasonal Changes in Hornets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, ''Vespa'') Caught with Bait Traps\n | url          = http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_10656155_po_ART0003849437.pdf?contentNo=1\n | journal      = Entomological Science\n | volume       = 1\n | issue        = 4\n | pages        = 537\u2013543\n | issn         = 1479-8298\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20190320030813/http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_10656155_po_ART0003849437.pdf?contentNo=1\n | archive-date = 20 March 2019\n | url-status     = live\n | accessdate   = 25 September 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n== Communication and perception ==\n''V. mandarinia'' uses both visual and chemical cues as a means of navigating itself and others to the desired location. Scent marking was discussed as a way for hornets to direct other members of the colony to a food source. Even with antennae damage, ''V. mandarinia'' was able to navigate itself. It was unable to find its destination only when vision impairment was induced. This implies that while [[Cell signaling|chemical signaling]] is important, visual cues play an equally important role in guiding individuals. Other behaviors include the formation of a \u201croyal court\u201d consisting of workers that lick and bite the queen, thereby ingesting her [[pheromones]].\n\nThese pheromones could directly communicate between the queen and her court or indirectly between her court and other workers due to the ingested pheromones. This is merely speculation, as no direct evidence has been collected to suggest the latter. ''Vespa mandarinia'' communicates acoustically, as well. When larvae are hungry, they scrape their mandibles against the walls of the cell. Furthermore, adult hornets click their [[mandibles]] as a warning to other creatures that encroach upon their territory.<ref name=\"Barth\" /><ref name=\"UWL\">{{cite web|url=http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2014/damro_jaco/adaptation.htm|title=''Vespa mandarinia''|website=UWL|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110203800/http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2014/damro_jaco/adaptation.htm|archive-date=10 January 2019|url-status=live|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Scent marking ==\n''Vespa mandarinia'' is the only species of social wasp known to apply a scent to direct its colony to a food source. The wasp secretes the chemical from the sixth sternal gland, also known as van der Vecht's gland. This behavior is observed during autumnal raids after the hornets begin hunting in groups instead of individually. The ability to apply scents may have arisen because the wasp relies heavily on honeybee colonies as its main food source. A single wasp is unable to take on an entire colony of bees because species such as ''[[Apis cerana]]'' have a well-organized defense mechanism. Honeybees swarm one wasp and flutter their wings to heat up the wasp and raise carbon dioxide to a lethal level.

The first set parameter observed interaction-mediated departures, which are defined as scenarios wherein one species leaves its position due to the arrival of a more dominant individual. The proportion of interaction-mediated departures was the lowest for ''V. mandarinia''. Another measured parameter was attempted patch entry. Over the observed time, conspecifics (interactions with the same species) resulted in refused entry far more than heterospecifics (interactions with different species). Lastly, fights between these hornets, ''[[Pseudotorynorrhina japonica]]'', ''[[Neope goschkevitschii]]'', and ''Lethe sicelis'' were observed, and once more ''V. mandarinia'' was the most dominant species. In 57 separate fights, one loss was observed to ''Neope goschkevitschii'', giving ''V. mandarinia'' a win rate of 98.3%.

The latter are favored targets in late summer and fall. Large insects like mantises are key protein sources to feed queens and drone larvae.\n\nThis hornet often attacks both colonies of other ''Vespa'' species (''[[Vespa simillima]]'' being the usual prey species) and [[honey bee]] hives to obtain the adults, pupae and [[larva]]e as food for their own larvae; sometimes they also cannibalize each other's colonies. A single scout, sometimes two or three, cautiously approaches the hive, producing pheromones to lead its nest-mates to the hive. The hornets can devastate a colony of honey bees, especially if it is the introduced [[western honey bee]]; a single hornet can kill as many as 40 bees per minute due to its large mandibles, which can quickly strike and decapitate prey. The honey bees' stings are ineffective because the hornets are five times their size and heavily armored. Only a few hornets (under 50) can exterminate a colony of tens of thousands of bees in a few hours.

European honey bees have no innate defense against the hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies.<ref name=Ross-9 /> Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the uncoordinated defenses of a honey bee colony, the Japanese honey bee (''[[Apis cerana japonica]]'') has an effective strategy. When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honey bee hive, she emits specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the Japanese honey bees detect these pheromones, a hundred or so gather near the entrance of the nest and set up a trap, keeping the entrance open. This permits the hornet to enter the hive. As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles in much the same way as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. In addition, the exertions of the honeybees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the ball.

Though these methods decrease damage done by ''V. mandarinia'', controlling them entirely is difficult.\n\n=== Beating ===\nHornets are crushed with wooden sticks with flat heads. Hornets do not counterattack when they are in the bee-hunting phase or the hive-attack phase (\"slaughter\"), but they aggressively guard a beehive once they kill the defenders and occupy it. The biggest expenditure in this method is time, as the process is inefficient.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Nest removal ===\nApplying poisons or fires at night is an effective way of exterminating a colony. The most difficult part about this tactic is finding the subterranean nests. The most common method of discovering nests is giving a piece of frog or fish meat attached to a cotton ball to a wasp and following it back to its nest. With ''V. mandarinia'', this is particularly difficult considering its common home flight radius of 1\u20132&nbsp;km. ''V. mandarinia'' travels up to 8&nbsp;km away from the nest.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Bait traps ===\nBait traps are placed in apiaries. The system consists of multiple compartments that direct the hornet into a one-sided hole which is difficult to return through once it is in the ''cul-de-sac'' compartment, an area located at the top of the box which bees can escape from through a mesh opening, but wasps cannot due to their large size. Baits used to attract the hornets include a diluted millet jelly solution, crude sugar solution with a mixture of intoxicants, vinegar, or fruit essence.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Mass poisoning ===\nHornets at the apiary are captured and fed a sugar solution or bee that has been poisoned with [[malathion]]. The toxin is expected to spread through [[trophallaxis]]. This method is good in principle, but has not been tested extensively.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Trapping at hive entrances ===\nThe trap is attached to the front of beehives. The effectiveness of the trap is determined by its ability to capture hornets while allowing bees to escape easily. The hornet enters the trap and catches a bee. When it tries to fly back through the entrance of the hive, it hits the front of the trap. The hornet flies upwards to escape and enters the capture chamber, where the hornets are left to die. Some hornets find a way to escape the trap through the front, so these traps can be very inefficient. <ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Protective screens ===\nAs explained in the trapping section, if met by resistance, hornets lose the urge to attack and instead retreat. Different measures of resistance include weeds, wire, or fishing nets or limiting the passage size so only bees can make it through. Experienced hornets catch on and eventually stay on these traps, awaiting the arrival of bees. The best method of controlling hornets is to combine these protective screens with traps.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n== Use as a nutritional supplement ==\n''Vespa'' amino acid mixture is a nutritional supplement consisting of larval saliva sold with the intent of improving endurance during exercise. Several companies in Asia and Europe have begun to manufacture [[dietary supplement]]s and [[energy drink]]s which contain synthetic versions of secretions of the larvae of ''V. mandarinia'', which the adult hornets usually consume. The manufacturers of these products make claims that consuming the larval hornet secretions (marketed as \"hornet juice\") will enhance human endurance because of the effect it has on adult hornets' performance. During laboratory testing on mice, increased [[lipolysis]] (metabolism of fat) was observed in rat [[adipocytes]] (fat cells) alongside improved swimming endurance, decreased [[lactic acid|lactate]], and increased [[glucose]] concentration in the bloodstream. While testing on mice has produced optimistic outcomes, trial tests on humans were inconclusive. Ten trained cyclists were given either an 80 ml serving of the mixture or a sports-drink placebo. Variables tested included the time to complete the 20&nbsp;km race, peak power, average power, maximum heart rate, and average [[heart rate]]. Participants who consumed it had significantly lower maximum heart rates, but no other statistically significant changes were seen.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Smith 1852\">{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=F. |year=1852 |title=VIII.

The entrance at the ground surface varies in length from 2 to 60&nbsp;cm either horizontally, inclined, or vertically. The queens that found the nest prefer narrow cavities.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\">{{cite journal|last=Matsuura|first=Makoto|last2=Sakagami|first2=Sh\u00f4ichi F.|date=October 1973|title=A Bionomic Sketch of the Giant Hornet, ''Vespa mandarinia'', a Serious Pest for Japanese Apiculture|url=https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/27557/1/19(1)_P125-162.pdf|url-status=live|journal=Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University|series=Series 6, Zoology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=125\u2013162|issn=0368-2188|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818210542/https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/27557/1/19(1)_P125-162.pdf|archive-date=18 August 2017|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nNests of ''Vespa'' typically lack a developed envelope. During the initial stages of development, the envelope is in an inverted-bowl shape. As the nest develops, one to three rough sheets of combs are created. Often, single [[wikt:primordial|primordial]] combs are created simultaneously and then fused into a single comb.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\nA system of one main pillar and secondary pillars connects the combs. Nests usually have four to seven combs. The top comb is abandoned after summer and left to rot. The largest comb is at the middle to bottom portion of the nest. The largest combs created by ''Vespa'' measured 49.5&nbsp;cm by 45.5&nbsp;cm with 1,192 cells (no obstacles, circular) and 61.0&nbsp;cm by 48.0&nbsp;cm (elliptical; wrapped around root system).<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n== Colony cycle ==\nThe nesting cycle of ''V. mandarinia'' is fairly consistent with that of other [[Eusociality|eusocial insects]]. Six phases occur in each cycle.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Prenesting period ===\nInseminated and uninseminated queens enter hibernation following a cycle. They first appear in early to mid-April and begin feeding on the sap of ''[[Quercus]]'' trees. Although this timing is consistent among hornets, ''V. mandarinia'' dominates the order, receiving preference for premium sap sources. Among the ''V. mandarinia'' queens is a [[dominance hierarchy]]. Top-ranked queens begin feeding, while the other queens form a circle around her. Once the top queen finishes, the second-highest ranking queen feeds. This process repeats until the last queen feeds at a poor hour.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Solitary, cooperative and polyethic periods ===\nInseminated queens start to search for nesting sites in late April. The uninseminated queens do not search for nests since their ovaries never fully develop. They continue to feed, but then disappear in early July.\n\nAn inseminated queen begins to create relatively small cells in which she raises around 40 small workers. Workers do not begin to work outside of the hive until July. Queens participate in activities outside the hive until mid-July when they stay inside the nest and allow workers to do extranidal activities. Early August marks a fully developed nest, containing three combs holding 500 cells and 100 workers. After mid-September, no more eggs are laid and the focus shifts to caring for larvae. The queens die in late October.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Dissolution and hibernating period ===\nMales and new queens take on their responsibilities in mid-September and mid-October, respectively. During this time, their body color becomes intense and the weight of the queen increases about 20%. Once the males and queen leave the nest, they do not return. In ''V. mandarinia'', males wait outside the nest entrance until the queen emerges. Once the queen emerges, they intercept her midair, bring her to the ground, and [[copulation (zoology)|copulate]] from 8 to 45 seconds. After this episode, the males return to the entrance for a second chance, while the queen leaves. Many queens attempt to fight off the males and leave unfertilized. After this episode, queens are found in moist, subterranean habitats.\n\nWhen sexed individuals emerge, workers shift their focus from protein and animal foods to carbohydrates. The last sexed individuals to emerge die of starvation.<ref name=\" Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n[[File:Vespa mandarinia japonica IMG 0214.JPG|thumb|An Asian giant hornet]]\n== Sting ==\nThe stinger of the Asian giant hornet is about {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} long,<ref name=\"ngeo\" /> and injects an especially potent [[venom]] that contains, like many bee and wasp venoms, a [[cytolysis|cytolytic]] [[peptide]] (specifically, a [[mastoparan]]) that can damage tissue by stimulating [[phospholipase]] action,<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" /> the stinger of the Asian giant hornet is about {{convert|4.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer than a traditional honeybee.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doumani|first=Beshara|issue=1987-05|title=We are Here to Stay|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3011869|journal=MERIP Middle East Report|issue=146|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3011869|issn=0888-0328}}</ref> In addition to its own phospholipase.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\nMasato Ono, an [[entomology|entomologist]] at [[Tamagawa University]] near Tokyo, described the sensation as feeling \"like a hot nail being driven into my leg\".<ref name=\"ngeo\" />\n\nThe venom contains a [[neurotoxin]] called mandaratoxin,<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" /> a single-chain [[polypeptide]] with a molecular weight around 20 [[kilodalton|kD]].<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" /> While a single wasp cannot inject a lethal dose, it can be lethal even to people who are not [[allergy|allergic]] if the dose is sufficient (i.e., if multiple stings are received).

And two sentences later it says not everyone displayed necrosis, contradicting this. }} The two likely reasons for skin hemorrhaging and necrosis are an inability to effectively neutralize the venom, or unusually potent venom toxicity for that set of stings. In either case, these stings lead to multiple organ injury. While not everyone displayed lesions or necrosis, a strong correlation existed between the number of stings and the severity of injury. Those who died, on average, were stung 59 times (with a [[standard deviation]] of 12), while those who survived suffered 28 stings (with a standard deviation of 4).<ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Yanagawa\n| first      = Youichi\n| last2      = Morita\n| first2     = Kentaro\n| date       = 10 October 1980\n| title      = Cutaneous hemorrhage or necrosis findings after ''Vespa mandarinia'' (wasp) stings may predict the occurrence of multiple organ injury: A case report and review of literature\n| journal    = Clinical Toxicology\n| publisher  = Informa Healthcare USA\n| doi=10.1080/15563650701664871\n| pmid      = 17952752\n| volume=45\n| issue      = 7\n| pages=803\u2013807\n}}</ref>\n\n== Parasites ==\n''Xenos moutoni'' is a common parasite among ''Vespa'' species. In a study of parasites among species of ''Vespa'', 4.3% of ''V. mandarinia'' females were parasitized. Males were not stylopized (parasitized by [[Stylopidae]], such as ''Xenos moutoni'') at all. The width of the stylopid's head and the host's head are positively correlated. The major consequence of being parasitized is the inability to reproduce for the following year. Stylopized queens follow the same fate as uninseminated queens. They do not search for an area to create a new colony and feed on sap until early July, when they disappear. In other species of ''Vespa'', males also have a chance of being stylopized. The consequences between the two sexes are similar, as neither sex is able to reproduce.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last         = Makino\n | first        = Shun'ichi\n | last2        = Yamashita\n | first2       = Yoshiharu\n | date         = 25 December 1998\n | title        = Levels of Parasitism by ''Xenos moutoni'' du Buysson (Strepsiptera, Stylopidae) and their Seasonal Changes in Hornets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, ''Vespa'') Caught with Bait Traps\n | url          = http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_10656155_po_ART0003849437.pdf?contentNo=1\n | journal      = Entomological Science\n | volume       = 1\n | issue        = 4\n | pages        = 537\u2013543\n | issn         = 1479-8298\n | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20190320030813/http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_10656155_po_ART0003849437.pdf?contentNo=1\n | archive-date = 20 March 2019\n | url-status     = live\n | accessdate   = 25 September 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n== Communication and perception ==\n''V. mandarinia'' uses both visual and chemical cues as a means of navigating itself and others to the desired location. Scent marking was discussed as a way for hornets to direct other members of the colony to a food source. Even with antennae damage, ''V. mandarinia'' was able to navigate itself. It was unable to find its destination only when vision impairment was induced. This implies that while [[Cell signaling|chemical signaling]] is important, visual cues play an equally important role in guiding individuals. Other behaviors include the formation of a \u201croyal court\u201d consisting of workers that lick and bite the queen, thereby ingesting her [[pheromones]].\n\nThese pheromones could directly communicate between the queen and her court or indirectly between her court and other workers due to the ingested pheromones. This is merely speculation, as no direct evidence has been collected to suggest the latter. ''Vespa mandarinia'' communicates acoustically, as well. When larvae are hungry, they scrape their mandibles against the walls of the cell. Furthermore, adult hornets click their [[mandibles]] as a warning to other creatures that encroach upon their territory.<ref name=\"Barth\" /><ref name=\"UWL\">{{cite web|url=http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2014/damro_jaco/adaptation.htm|title=''Vespa mandarinia''|website=UWL|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110203800/http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2014/damro_jaco/adaptation.htm|archive-date=10 January 2019|url-status=live|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Scent marking ==\n''Vespa mandarinia'' is the only species of social wasp known to apply a scent to direct its colony to a food source. The wasp secretes the chemical from the sixth sternal gland, also known as van der Vecht's gland. This behavior is observed during autumnal raids after the hornets begin hunting in groups instead of individually. The ability to apply scents may have arisen because the wasp relies heavily on honeybee colonies as its main food source. A single wasp is unable to take on an entire colony of bees because species such as ''[[Apis cerana]]'' have a well-organized defense mechanism. Honeybees swarm one wasp and flutter their wings to heat up the wasp and raise carbon dioxide to a lethal level. So, organized attacks are much more effective and easily devastate a colony of tens of thousands of honeybees.<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Benjamin J.|last2=Nordheim|first2=Erik V.|last3=Schueller|first3=Teresa I.|last4=Jeanne|first4=Robert L.|date=28 February 2011|title=Recruitment in swarm-founding wasps: ''Polybia occidentalis'' does not actively scent-mark carbohydrate food sources|journal=[[Psyche (entomology journal)|Psyche]]|volume=2011|page=378576|doi=10.1155/2011/378576|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Interspecies dominance ==\nIn an experiment observing four different species of ''Vespa'', including ''V. ducalis'', ''V. crabro'', ''V. analis'', and ''V. mandarinia'', ''V. mandarinia'' was the dominant species.

The first set parameter observed interaction-mediated departures, which are defined as scenarios wherein one species leaves its position due to the arrival of a more dominant individual. The proportion of interaction-mediated departures was the lowest for ''V. mandarinia''. Another measured parameter was attempted patch entry. Over the observed time, conspecifics (interactions with the same species) resulted in refused entry far more than heterospecifics (interactions with different species). Lastly, fights between these hornets, ''[[Pseudotorynorrhina japonica]]'', ''[[Neope goschkevitschii]]'', and ''Lethe sicelis'' were observed, and once more ''V. mandarinia'' was the most dominant species.

The latter are favored targets in late summer and fall. Large insects like mantises are key protein sources to feed queens and drone larvae.\n\nThis hornet often attacks both colonies of other ''Vespa'' species (''[[Vespa simillima]]'' being the usual prey species) and [[honey bee]] hives to obtain the adults, pupae and [[larva]]e as food for their own larvae; sometimes they also cannibalize each other's colonies. A single scout, sometimes two or three, cautiously approaches the hive, producing pheromones to lead its nest-mates to the hive. The hornets can devastate a colony of honey bees, especially if it is the introduced [[western honey bee]]; a single hornet can kill as many as 40 bees per minute due to its large mandibles, which can quickly strike and decapitate prey. The honey bees' stings are ineffective because the hornets are five times their size and heavily armored. Only a few hornets (under 50) can exterminate a colony of tens of thousands of bees in a few hours.

When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honey bee hive, she emits specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the Japanese honey bees detect these pheromones, a hundred or so gather near the entrance of the nest and set up a trap, keeping the entrance open. This permits the hornet to enter the hive. As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles in much the same way as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. In addition, the exertions of the honeybees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the ball.

Though these methods decrease damage done by ''V. mandarinia'', controlling them entirely is difficult.\n\n=== Beating ===\nHornets are crushed with wooden sticks with flat heads. Hornets do not counterattack when they are in the bee-hunting phase or the hive-attack phase (\"slaughter\"), but they aggressively guard a beehive once they kill the defenders and occupy it. The biggest expenditure in this method is time, as the process is inefficient.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Nest removal ===\nApplying poisons or fires at night is an effective way of exterminating a colony. The most difficult part about this tactic is finding the subterranean nests. The most common method of discovering nests is giving a piece of frog or fish meat attached to a cotton ball to a wasp and following it back to its nest. With ''V. mandarinia'', this is particularly difficult considering its common home flight radius of 1\u20132&nbsp;km. ''V. mandarinia'' travels up to 8&nbsp;km away from the nest.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Bait traps ===\nBait traps are placed in apiaries. The system consists of multiple compartments that direct the hornet into a one-sided hole which is difficult to return through once it is in the ''cul-de-sac'' compartment, an area located at the top of the box which bees can escape from through a mesh opening, but wasps cannot due to their large size. Baits used to attract the hornets include a diluted millet jelly solution, crude sugar solution with a mixture of intoxicants, vinegar, or fruit essence.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Mass poisoning ===\nHornets at the apiary are captured and fed a sugar solution or bee that has been poisoned with [[malathion]]. The toxin is expected to spread through [[trophallaxis]]. This method is good in principle, but has not been tested extensively.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Trapping at hive entrances ===\nThe trap is attached to the front of beehives. The effectiveness of the trap is determined by its ability to capture hornets while allowing bees to escape easily. The hornet enters the trap and catches a bee. When it tries to fly back through the entrance of the hive, it hits the front of the trap. The hornet flies upwards to escape and enters the capture chamber, where the hornets are left to die. Some hornets find a way to escape the trap through the front, so these traps can be very inefficient. <ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n=== Protective screens ===\nAs explained in the trapping section, if met by resistance, hornets lose the urge to attack and instead retreat. Different measures of resistance include weeds, wire, or fishing nets or limiting the passage size so only bees can make it through. Experienced hornets catch on and eventually stay on these traps, awaiting the arrival of bees. The best method of controlling hornets is to combine these protective screens with traps.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n== Use as a nutritional supplement ==\n''Vespa'' amino acid mixture is a nutritional supplement consisting of larval saliva sold with the intent of improving endurance during exercise. Several companies in Asia and Europe have begun to manufacture [[dietary supplement]]s and [[energy drink]]s which contain synthetic versions of secretions of the larvae of ''V. mandarinia'', which the adult hornets usually consume. The manufacturers of these products make claims that consuming the larval hornet secretions (marketed as \"hornet juice\") will enhance human endurance because of the effect it has on adult hornets' performance. During laboratory testing on mice, increased [[lipolysis]] (metabolism of fat) was observed in rat [[adipocytes]] (fat cells) alongside improved swimming endurance, decreased [[lactic acid|lactate]], and increased [[glucose]] concentration in the bloodstream. While testing on mice has produced optimistic outcomes, trial tests on humans were inconclusive. Ten trained cyclists were given either an 80 ml serving of the mixture or a sports-drink placebo. Variables tested included the time to complete the 20&nbsp;km race, peak power, average power, maximum heart rate, and average [[heart rate]]. Participants who consumed it had significantly lower maximum heart rates, but no other statistically significant changes were seen.<ref name=\"Matsuura Sakagami 1973\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Smith 1852\">{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=F. |year=1852 |title=VIII.
