The first College President was Hae-Uoung Shin. As an academic institution of nationalistic origin, it was regarded as a symbol of national pride during  the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]] (1910\u20131945).\n\nBosung College had to endure many hardships before Korea University of today came into being. Shortly after Bosung College was established, the \"Korea-Japan Protocol\" was signed, and Lee Yong-Ik, founder of Bosung College, went into [[exile]] to lead the resistance movement against Japan. His exile created financial hardship for the institution. Fortunately, however, the first [[financial crisis]] was overcome when Sohn Byong-Hee, a leader of [[Cheondoism|Chundokyo]], a nationalist, religious and [[political movement]] at the time, took over the management of the institution.\n\nBy 1929 the [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] once again faced a serious [[financial crisis]] as a result of the worldwide [[recession]]. Kim Sung-Soo came to the rescue when he became the president of the College in 1932. At that time, Kim was managing  Choong-Ang High School and the [[Dong-A Ilbo]], a daily newspaper.\n\n===Relocation===\nIn June 1932, Kim Sung-Soo took office as President of Bosung College, and in 1934 the main building was completed on a 63,000-pyeong area of land located in [[Anam-dong]]. Construction of the library started in 1935 to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Bosung College, and was completed two years later. In July of the following year, a large [[Playing field|athletic field]], was added to the campus. Kim Sung-Soo, as President, made every effort to develop Bosung College into the first genuine Korean university. Unfortunately, his hopes did not come to fruition due to restrictions placed during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]]. In April 1944, the Japanese colonial government forced Bosung College to change its name and placed it under the supervision of the Japanese authorities.\n\n===Modern era===\nFollowing Independence in 1945, the status of Bosung College was elevated to that of a [[university]] comprising three colleges, Political Science and Law, Economics and Commerce, and Liberal Arts. Hyun Sang-Yun, the first president, initiated an expansion of the campus by purchasing forest and land. In June 1949, Korea University awarded its first [[bachelor's degree]]s and in September of the same year, the graduate school was established. Yu Chin-O, the fourth president, continued to expand Korea University with the establishment of the Division of [[Science]] within the College of [[Liberal Arts]], as well as a fourth college, the College of [[Agriculture]].\n\nIn June 1961 the present Liberal Arts building (Seokwan) was completed. Various facilities were also completed such as the [[museum]], the agriculture [[laboratory]], the [[greenhouse]], and other buildings for student services. In the same year, an experimental farm of about 1,680,000 pyeong was added to the facilities. In addition, the [[Science]] and [[Engineering]] Departments were equipped with laboratories and instruments. In December 1963, the [[Business school|Graduate School of Business Administration]], the first of its kind in Korea, was established. In October 1965, Yu Chin-O retired after fifteen years of service as the fourth president of Korea University and was succeeded by Professor Lee Chong-Woo as the fifth president. After 1966, Korea University continued to expand with a gradual increase in the number of departments within the College of Science and Engineering and in the College of Agriculture. The Graduate School of Education was also founded. More facilities, including the new annex buildings, the General Education Building (Kyoyangkwan), and the [[Mass Communication]] Building (Hongbokwan), were added.\n\nIn October 1970, Dr. Kim Sang-Hyup, professor of [[political science]], was appointed as the sixth president, succeeding Lee Chong-Woo who retired in September of that year. In December 1971, a major reorganization of Korea University took place. In accordance with the long-term development plan, all Woosuk University colleges, including Medicine, Liberal Arts and Sciences, Law and Economics, Junior College of Allied Health Sciences, as well as Woosuk [[Teaching hospital|University Hospital]], were completely integrated into Korea University. In June 1972, the Business Administration Building (Kyoyangkwan) was completed to accommodate the College of Commerce and the Graduate School of Business Administration. In December of the same year, the College of [[Education]] was established.\n\nIn April 1975, President Kim Sang-Hyup was succeeded by Cha Rak-Hoon who became the seventh president. In December 1976, the College of Commerce was renamed the College of Business Administration. The Graduate School of Food and Agriculture was established in January of the following year. In December 1977, the College of Science and Engineering were separated into the College of Science and the College of Engineering. In addition, the new Central Library, the largest of its kind in [[South Korea]] at that time, was opened in March 1978. In July 1983, [[Medical School]] and [[hospital]] were expanded and reorganized into the Korea University [[Academic health science centre|Medical Center]], which then included four new hospitals: Haewha, Guro, Yeoju and Ansan. In September 1983, the Science Library opened as the center for science and technology research and was at that time the largest and most modern building on the campus.\n\nIn June 2001, Korea University concluded a joint academic program with the [[University of British Columbia]] in Canada. The Korea University Lyceum was completed and [[SK Telecom]] made a significant contribution in the same month. In July, the Division of International Studies and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication were founded. In October, Korea University obtained ISO9001 authentication in all educational and administrative areas.\n\n===100th anniversary===\nIn 2005, Korea University celebrated its Centennial Anniversary of Foundation Day, May 5.\n\nIn March the College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology and the College of Life and Environmental Sciences were integrated into the [[Korea University College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology|College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology]]. At the same time, the [[Junior College]] of Health Sciences was abolished and merged into the new highly developed College of Health Sciences.\n\nCurrently, Korea University is composed of sixteen colleges and divisions, as well as eighteen graduate schools and eleven auxiliary facilities, including [[Library|libraries]], a [[museum]], and a press office for public relations.\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Colleges and schools===\nKorea University's 59 academic departments and programs are organized into 17 colleges and schools:\n{{columns|width=auto\n| col1 =\n* [[Korea University Law School|Law School]]\n* [[Korea University Business School|Business School]]\n* [[Korea University College of Liberal Arts|College of Liberal Arts]]\n* [[Korea University College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology|College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology]]\n* [[Korea University College of Political Science and Economics|College of Political Science and Economics]]\n* [[Korea University College of Science|College of Science]]\n* [[Korea University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]\n* [[Korea University College of Medicine|College of Medicine]]\n| col2 =\n* [[Korea University College of Education|College of Education]]\n* [[Korea University College of Nursing|College of Nursing]]\n* [[Korea University College of Informatics|College of Informatics]]\n* [[Korea University College of Health Science|College of Health Science]]\n* [[Korea University School of Art and Design|School of Art and Design]]\n* [[Korea University Division of International Studies|Division of International Studies]]\n* [[Korea University School of Media and Communication|School of Media and Communication]]\n* [[Korea University School of Instrumentation|Mechatronics]]\n* [[Korea University School of Interdisciplinary Studies|School of Interdisciplinary Studies]]\n}}\n\n===Departments and Programs===\n{{columns|width=auto\n| col1 =\n* [[Law]]\n* [[Business Administration]]\n* Korean Language and Literature\n* [[Philosophy]]\n* [[History of Korea|Korean History]]\n* [[History]]\n* [[Psychology]]\n* [[Sociology]]\n* [[Classical Chinese]]\n* English Language and Literature\n* German Language and Literature\n* French Language and Literature\n* Chinese Language and Literature\n* Russian Language and Literature<ref>https://kuruss.korea.ac.kr/kuruss/index.do</ref>\n* Japanese Language and Literature\n* Spanish Language and Literature\n* [[Linguistics]]\n* [[Life Sciences]]\n* [[Biotechnology]]\n* Food Bioscience and Technology\n| col2 =\n* Environmental Science and Ecological Engineering\n* Food and Resource Economics\n* Political Science and International Relations\n* [[Economics]]\n* [[Statistics]]\n* [[Public Administration]]\n* [[Mathematics]]\n* [[Physics]]\n* [[Chemistry]]\n* Earth and Environmental Science\n* [[Materials Science and Engineering]]\n* Chemical Engineering and Biological engineering\n* Civil, Environmental and Architectural engineering\n* [[Architecture]]\n* [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* Industrial Management Engineering\n* [[Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[Medical Science]]\n* [[Education]]\n* [[Physical Education]]\n| col3 =\n* Home Economics Education\n* [[Mathematics Education]]\n* Korean Language Education\n* English Language Education\n* Geography Education\n* History Education\n* [[Nursing]]\n* [[Biomedical Engineering]]\n* Biosystem and Biomedical Science\n* Health and Environmental Science\n*Health Policy and Management\n* [[Computer Science and Engineering]]\n* Cyber Defense\n* [[Art and Design]]\n* [[International Studies]]\n* Media and Communication\n* Interdisciplinary Studies\n}}\n\n===Interdisciplinary Programs===\n{{columns|width=auto\n| col1 =\n* Science and Technology Studies\n* Liberal Arts and Law\n* EML (Emerging Market & Latin America) Program\n* Language, Brain & Computer\n* Humanities and Creative Industry\n* Global Leader for East Asian Century\n* Ecologic landscape\n* Climate Change Program\n* Medical Science and Engineering\n* Financial Engineering\n* Law and Public Administration\n* PEL(Politics, Economics and Law)\n* Cryptology\n| col2 =\n* Fashion Design and Merchandising\n* Multicultural Korean Education\n* Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n* Software Technology & Entrepreneurship Program (STEP)\n* Food Industrial Management\n* Public Governance and Leadership\n* Medical Convergence Engineering\n* Convergence Security\n* Information Security\n* Social Welfare\n* DMC (Digital Media Culture)\n* Financial Derivatives Engineering\n* GKS (Global Korea Scholarship) Major Convergence\n}}\n\n===Admissions Selectivity===\nAdmission to the undergraduate program is very competitive and the admission decisions are based on the applicants' high school transcripts and scores on the South Korean [[College Scholastic Ability Test]].

The first College President was Hae-Uoung Shin. As an academic institution of nationalistic origin, it was regarded as a symbol of national pride during  the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]] (1910\u20131945).\n\nBosung College had to endure many hardships before Korea University of today came into being. Shortly after Bosung College was established, the \"Korea-Japan Protocol\" was signed, and Lee Yong-Ik, founder of Bosung College, went into [[exile]] to lead the resistance movement against Japan. His exile created financial hardship for the institution. Fortunately, however, the first [[financial crisis]] was overcome when Sohn Byong-Hee, a leader of [[Cheondoism|Chundokyo]], a nationalist, religious and [[political movement]] at the time, took over the management of the institution.\n\nBy 1929 the [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] once again faced a serious [[financial crisis]] as a result of the worldwide [[recession]]. Kim Sung-Soo came to the rescue when he became the president of the College in 1932. At that time, Kim was managing  Choong-Ang High School and the [[Dong-A Ilbo]], a daily newspaper.\n\n===Relocation===\nIn June 1932, Kim Sung-Soo took office as President of Bosung College, and in 1934 the main building was completed on a 63,000-pyeong area of land located in [[Anam-dong]]. Construction of the library started in 1935 to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Bosung College, and was completed two years later. In July of the following year, a large [[Playing field|athletic field]], was added to the campus. Kim Sung-Soo, as President, made every effort to develop Bosung College into the first genuine Korean university. Unfortunately, his hopes did not come to fruition due to restrictions placed during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]]. In April 1944, the Japanese colonial government forced Bosung College to change its name and placed it under the supervision of the Japanese authorities.\n\n===Modern era===\nFollowing Independence in 1945, the status of Bosung College was elevated to that of a [[university]] comprising three colleges, Political Science and Law, Economics and Commerce, and Liberal Arts. Hyun Sang-Yun, the first president, initiated an expansion of the campus by purchasing forest and land. In June 1949, Korea University awarded its first [[bachelor's degree]]s and in September of the same year, the graduate school was established. Yu Chin-O, the fourth president, continued to expand Korea University with the establishment of the Division of [[Science]] within the College of [[Liberal Arts]], as well as a fourth college, the College of [[Agriculture]].\n\nIn June 1961 the present Liberal Arts building (Seokwan) was completed. Various facilities were also completed such as the [[museum]], the agriculture [[laboratory]], the [[greenhouse]], and other buildings for student services. In the same year, an experimental farm of about 1,680,000 pyeong was added to the facilities. In addition, the [[Science]] and [[Engineering]] Departments were equipped with laboratories and instruments. In December 1963, the [[Business school|Graduate School of Business Administration]], the first of its kind in Korea, was established. In October 1965, Yu Chin-O retired after fifteen years of service as the fourth president of Korea University and was succeeded by Professor Lee Chong-Woo as the fifth president. After 1966, Korea University continued to expand with a gradual increase in the number of departments within the College of Science and Engineering and in the College of Agriculture. The Graduate School of Education was also founded. More facilities, including the new annex buildings, the General Education Building (Kyoyangkwan), and the [[Mass Communication]] Building (Hongbokwan), were added.\n\nIn October 1970, Dr. Kim Sang-Hyup, professor of [[political science]], was appointed as the sixth president, succeeding Lee Chong-Woo who retired in September of that year. In December 1971, a major reorganization of Korea University took place.

In December 1977, the College of Science and Engineering were separated into the College of Science and the College of Engineering. In addition, the new Central Library, the largest of its kind in [[South Korea]] at that time, was opened in March 1978. In July 1983, [[Medical School]] and [[hospital]] were expanded and reorganized into the Korea University [[Academic health science centre|Medical Center]], which then included four new hospitals: Haewha, Guro, Yeoju and Ansan. In September 1983, the Science Library opened as the center for science and technology research and was at that time the largest and most modern building on the campus.\n\nIn June 2001, Korea University concluded a joint academic program with the [[University of British Columbia]] in Canada.
