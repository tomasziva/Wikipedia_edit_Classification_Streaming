Based on the [[Daihatsu Boon]] (also branded as [[Daihatsu Sirion]], Toyota Passo and [[Subaru Justy]]), the Myvi is the result of Perodua's collaboration with both [[Toyota]] and [[Daihatsu]]. However, the third generation Myvi was entirely designed and made in-house in Malaysia, not being based on the third generation Boon.

Both engines are locally built at Perodua's [[Serendah]] plant.<ref name=\"Malaysia engine production 2011-2014 marklines.com\"/>\n\nIn addition to raw performance, features previously uncommon on Perodua cars were inherited from the Sirion to the Myvi. Among them are four-hole injectors, foamed [[polyurethane|urethane]] injected to the [[A-pillar]], [[Pillar (car)|centre pillar]] and [[B-pillar]] for noise insulation, [[Immobiliser|immobiliser systems]] and [[Automobile safety#Pedestrian safety|pedestrian injury reduction body construction]].

Its 1.3 Premium trim additionally features new UV protection glass, a seat height adjuster, as well as a new audio system with [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] and [[Bluetooth]] capabilities.<ref name=\"myvifacelift\"/>\n\nA \"Special Edition\" of the new Perodua Myvi SE was also launched on October 10, 2008 with a new bumpers, clear taillights, smoked headlights, an amber instrument panel, leather seats, and a 2-DIN [[Compact Disc player]] with MP3, WMA, USB and Bluetooth support instead of an integrated unit. It is only available with a 1.3L engine with a manual or automatic transmission.<ref name=\"myvisefacelift\"/>\n\nAn \"Exclusive Edition\" of the Perodua Myvi was also launched on October 2009. It is very similar to the SE variant but with side skirt only, the front and rear bumpers remain the same design as the standard Myvis. Only three colours are available \u2013 Ebony Black, Ivory White and Medallion Grey. It\u2019s priced at RM51,000 for solid colours and RM51,500 for metallic colours.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://paultan.org/2009/10/24/perodua-myvi-exclusive-edition-limited-to-5000-cars/|title=Perodua Myvi Exclusive Edition limited to 5,000 cars|date=2009-10-24|work=Paul Tan's Automotive News|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nA \"Limited Edition\" of the Perodua Myvi was also launched on July 2010.

''[[The Edge (Malaysia)|The Edge Daily]]'', a local financial news media reported that Myvi sales have far surpassed its initial expectations and has been selling extremely well since its rollout in April.\n\nProton's Savvy, available to the market a few months after the launch of the Myvi, had not affected Myvi sales. Observing the strong demand for the Myvi, it boosted sales of vehicles in the country and Perodua's market share in 2006.\n\n===Reviews===\n[[Richard Hammond]], a presenter on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/motoring/hammond/tm_method=full%26objectid=17707140%26siteid=89520-name_page.html |title=Richard Hammond Test Drive Myvi |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=2006-09-08 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> gave a positive review of the Perodua Myvi, saying:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"No jokes, this is a good-looking car. But if it looks familiar, that's because this is a [[Daihatsu Sirion]] in all but name. You see it costs billions to develop a new car \u2013 you design them on computers then build lots of them to crash into walls. So Perodua let someone else do it and spent their money sticking a new badge on it.\n\nBut they kept a bit back to spend on styling. Which is why, even though it shares bits and pieces with the Sirion, the Myvi is better looking...\n\n...So under seven grand for a good-looking car, built in a factory shared with Toyota, which handles as well as a Yaris, does nearly 50mpg with a three-year warranty \u2013 yes please.''\"\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Jeremy Clarkson]]'s review was less positive, claiming the brakes, the ride, the seats and the interior were \"rubbish\". He also humorously suggested that \"this is a car you drive with a long face\".\n\nA 2009 study by [[J.D. Power|J.D. Power & Associates]] saw the Myvi ranked highest for its initial quality in terms of new-vehicle ownership in the compact car segment.<ref>[http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/business-news/151851-myvi-tops-initial-quality-for-new-compact-car-survey.html Myvi tops 'initial quality for new compact car' survey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024042234/http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/business-news/151851-myvi-tops-initial-quality-for-new-compact-car-survey.html |date=October 24, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsbusiness.php?id=448455 |title=Myvi Tops Initial Quality For New Compact Car |publisher=Bernama.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>\n\nA popular trend have been surrounding most Myvi owners society is that because of the car's impressive performance and due to the light weight, Perodua Myvi has always been regard as \"Malaysian supercar\", it is unknown when this nickname trend started.

Despite the fact that the 1.3-litre is a carry-over from the previous generation Myvi, Perodua reported an increase of 10 hp for the new model. The increase was attributed to the new electric power steering (EPS) system. Additionally, the 1.5-litre 3SZ-VE engine, which also powers the [[Perodua Alza]], is imported from the [[Daihatsu]] engine plant in [[Karawang]], Indonesia.<ref name=\"Indonesia engine production 2011-2014 marklines.com\"/>\n\nDual SRS Airbags are standard across the range, the first of the national badged cars in [[Malaysia]].

Both are available in a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual gearbox.

Also the [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] is not available, in contrast with the original model.\n\nProjector headlamp, Electronic Power Steering and dual airbags are standard across the range. The standard trim gets steel rims with caps, and other variants get alloy rims and [[Foglamps]]. The automatic transmission lever is now relocated to the dashboard area like the [[Perodua Alza]].

Available with either manual or automatic transmission, the Sirion that was sold in Indonesia was mainly based on the 1.5 SE trim sold in Malaysia but instead of having a 1.5-litre engine, the Indonesia market Sirion used a 1.3-litre engine. Other notable difference from the Malaysian 1.5 SE trim included the instrument cluster from the Malaysian market 1.3 Premium X and a headunit system that was not used in any Myvi's bound for the Malaysian market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://autonetmagz.com/kado-valentine-dari-daihatsu-sirion-facelift-2015-resmi-meluncur-hari-ini/25855/|title=Kado Valentine dari Daihatsu, Sirion Facelift 2015 Resmi Meluncur Hari Ini|last=Satrio|first=Hillarius|date=2015-02-14|website=AutonetMagz :: Review Mobil dan Motor Baru Indonesia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> \n\nThe third generation Perodua Myvi was also rebadged as the Daihatsu Sirion for the Indonesian market.

The Myvi was the best-selling car in Malaysia for 8 consecutive years, between 2006 and 2013.<ref>[http://www.motortrader.com.my/NUS/articles/article_2326/page_m.asp Press Release by Motor Trader Malaysia, Source from Malaysian Automotive Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305223723/http://www.motortrader.com.my/NUS/articles/article_2326/page_m.asp |date=2010-03-05 }}</ref><ref name=\"myvi2010sales\">{{cite web|last=Tan |first=Paul |url=http://paultan.org/2011/01/12/perodua-achieves-record-sales-in-2010-5-year-old-myvi-is-still-malaysias-best-selling-car-alza-leads-the-mpv-charts/ |title= Perodua achieves record sales in 2010: 5-year old Myvi is still Malaysia\u2019s best selling car |publisher=Paultan.org }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sales_of_Perodua_passenger_vehicles_in_Malaysia,_1994_-_2013_(b).png |title=Sales of Perodua passenger vehicles in Malaysia, 1994 \u2013 2013 |publisher= |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> As of February 2019, the Myvi reached nearly 1.1 million units sold since the launched of its first generation in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2019/02/12/perodua-delivers-100000-units-of-perodua-myvi-since-nov-2017/ |title=Perodua delivers 100,000 units of Perodua Myvi since Nov 2017 |publisher=The Borneo Post |date=12 February 2019 |accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|M300}} First generation (M300; 2005\u20132011) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (M300)\n| image = Faceliftd Myvi (cropped).jpg\n| aka = {{unbulleted list\n  | Daihatsu Boon/Sirion (Japan/international)\n  | Daihatsu Sirion (Indonesia, April 2007 \u2013 July 2011)\n  }}\n| production = May 2005 \u2013 June 2011\n| related = [[Perodua Alza]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | 1.0 L ''[[Daihatsu E-series engine#EJ|EJ-VE]]'' [[Inline-three engine|I3]] ([[Petrol engine|petrol]])\n  | 1.3 L ''[[Toyota SZ engine#2SZ-FE|K3-VE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (petrol)\n  }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n  | 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2440|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|3630|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1665|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1550|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|980|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| sp = uk\n}}\n\n===Equipment levels===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = Perodua MyVi (front), Kuala Lumpur.jpg\n| caption1 = 2005\u20132008 Myvi\n| image2 = Perodua MyVi (first generation, SE) (front), Serdang.jpg\n| caption2 = 2007\u20132008 Myvi SE\n| image3 = 2011 Perodua Myvi 1.3 Standard in Cyberjaya, Malaysia (01).jpg\n| caption3 = 2008\u20132011 Myvi Standard\n| image4 = 2010 Perodua Myvi SE in Cyberjaya, Malaysia (03).jpg\n| caption4 = 2008\u20132011 Myvi SE\n| image5 = 2010 Perodua Myvi LE in Cyberjaya, Malaysia (01).jpg\n| caption5 = 2010\u20132011 Myvi LE\n}}\n\nThe Myvi was made available in five [[Trim level (automobile)|trim levels]]: 1.0SR (five-speed manual), 1.3SX (five-speed manual), 1.3EZ (four-speed auto), 1.3SXi (five-speed manual) and 1.3EZi \"Premium\" (four-speed auto).

Both engines are locally built at Perodua's [[Serendah]] plant.<ref name=\"Malaysia engine production 2011-2014 marklines.com\"/>\n\nIn addition to raw performance, features previously uncommon on Perodua cars were inherited from the Sirion to the Myvi. Among them are four-hole injectors, foamed [[polyurethane|urethane]] injected to the [[A-pillar]], [[Pillar (car)|centre pillar]] and [[B-pillar]] for noise insulation, [[Immobiliser|immobiliser systems]] and [[Automobile safety#Pedestrian safety|pedestrian injury reduction body construction]].

Its 1.3 Premium trim additionally features new UV protection glass, a seat height adjuster, as well as a new audio system with [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] and [[Bluetooth]] capabilities.<ref name=\"myvifacelift\"/>\n\nA \"Special Edition\" of the new Perodua Myvi SE was also launched on October 10, 2008 with a new bumpers, clear taillights, smoked headlights, an amber instrument panel, leather seats, and a 2-DIN [[Compact Disc player]] with MP3, WMA, USB and Bluetooth support instead of an integrated unit. It is only available with a 1.3L engine with a manual or automatic transmission.<ref name=\"myvisefacelift\"/>\n\nAn \"Exclusive Edition\" of the Perodua Myvi was also launched on October 2009. It is very similar to the SE variant but with side skirt only, the front and rear bumpers remain the same design as the standard Myvis. Only three colours are available \u2013 Ebony Black, Ivory White and Medallion Grey. It\u2019s priced at RM51,000 for solid colours and RM51,500 for metallic colours.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://paultan.org/2009/10/24/perodua-myvi-exclusive-edition-limited-to-5000-cars/|title=Perodua Myvi Exclusive Edition limited to 5,000 cars|date=2009-10-24|work=Paul Tan's Automotive News|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nA \"Limited Edition\" of the Perodua Myvi was also launched on July 2010.

''[[The Edge (Malaysia)|The Edge Daily]]'', a local financial news media reported that Myvi sales have far surpassed its initial expectations and has been selling extremely well since its rollout in April.\n\nProton's Savvy, available to the market a few months after the launch of the Myvi, had not affected Myvi sales. Observing the strong demand for the Myvi, it boosted sales of vehicles in the country and Perodua's market share in 2006.\n\n===Reviews===\n[[Richard Hammond]], a presenter on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/motoring/hammond/tm_method=full%26objectid=17707140%26siteid=89520-name_page.html |title=Richard Hammond Test Drive Myvi |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=2006-09-08 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> gave a positive review of the Perodua Myvi, saying:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"No jokes, this is a good-looking car. But if it looks familiar, that's because this is a [[Daihatsu Sirion]] in all but name. You see it costs billions to develop a new car \u2013 you design them on computers then build lots of them to crash into walls. So Perodua let someone else do it and spent their money sticking a new badge on it.\n\nBut they kept a bit back to spend on styling. Which is why, even though it shares bits and pieces with the Sirion, the Myvi is better looking...\n\n...So under seven grand for a good-looking car, built in a factory shared with Toyota, which handles as well as a Yaris, does nearly 50mpg with a three-year warranty \u2013 yes please.''\"\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Jeremy Clarkson]]'s review was less positive, claiming the brakes, the ride, the seats and the interior were \"rubbish\". He also humorously suggested that \"this is a car you drive with a long face\".\n\nA 2009 study by [[J.D. Power|J.D. Power & Associates]] saw the Myvi ranked highest for its initial quality in terms of new-vehicle ownership in the compact car segment.<ref>[http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/business-news/151851-myvi-tops-initial-quality-for-new-compact-car-survey.html Myvi tops 'initial quality for new compact car' survey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024042234/http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/business-news/151851-myvi-tops-initial-quality-for-new-compact-car-survey.html |date=October 24, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsbusiness.php?id=448455 |title=Myvi Tops Initial Quality For New Compact Car |publisher=Bernama.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref>\n\nA popular trend have been surrounding most Myvi owners society is that because of the car's impressive performance and due to the light weight, Perodua Myvi has always been regard as \"Malaysian supercar\", it is unknown when this nickname trend started.

Despite the fact that the 1.3-litre is a carry-over from the previous generation Myvi, Perodua reported an increase of 10 hp for the new model. The increase was attributed to the new electric power steering (EPS) system. Additionally, the 1.5-litre 3SZ-VE engine, which also powers the [[Perodua Alza]], is imported from the [[Daihatsu]] engine plant in [[Karawang]], Indonesia.<ref name=\"Indonesia engine production 2011-2014 marklines.com\"/>\n\nDual SRS Airbags are standard across the range, the first of the national badged cars in [[Malaysia]].

Both are available in a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual gearbox.

Also the [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] is not available, in contrast with the original model.\n\nProjector headlamp, Electronic Power Steering and dual airbags are standard across the range. The standard trim gets steel rims with caps, and other variants get alloy rims and [[Foglamps]]. The automatic transmission lever is now relocated to the dashboard area like the [[Perodua Alza]]. An integrated 2-DIN 6-inch touchscreen DVD Navigation system with Maps powered by [[Telekom Malaysia]] is available in the 1.3L Elegance and all 1.5L variants.

It was launched on 23 July 2011 at the 2011 [[Indonesia International Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Daihatsu Sirion 2nd gen news\"/> Like the previous generation Sirion, the new Sirion is also imported as a CBU model from Perodua's factory in [[Rawang, Selangor|Rawang]], Malaysia. The second generation Sirion sold in Indonesia is based on the Perodua Myvi in its mid-range Premium trim level.<ref name=\"Daihatsu Sirion 2nd gen news\"/> Apart from the different badges, steering wheel and the lack of airbags and [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], the second generation Sirion is largely identical to the Myvi Premium. At launch, the new Daihatsu Sirion 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic costed between 139,500,000 and 150,500,000 rupiah (RM48,715 and RM52,556) respectively.<ref name=\"Daihatsu Sirion 2nd gen news\"/>\n\nIn February 2015, the second generation Myvi facelift was launched in Indonesia. Available with either manual or automatic transmission, the Sirion that was sold in Indonesia was mainly based on the 1.5 SE trim sold in Malaysia but instead of having a 1.5-litre engine, the Indonesia market Sirion used a 1.3-litre engine. Other notable difference from the Malaysian 1.5 SE trim included the instrument cluster from the Malaysian market 1.3 Premium X and a headunit system that was not used in any Myvi's bound for the Malaysian market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://autonetmagz.com/kado-valentine-dari-daihatsu-sirion-facelift-2015-resmi-meluncur-hari-ini/25855/|title=Kado Valentine dari Daihatsu, Sirion Facelift 2015 Resmi Meluncur Hari Ini|last=Satrio|first=Hillarius|date=2015-02-14|website=AutonetMagz :: Review Mobil dan Motor Baru Indonesia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> \n\nThe third generation Perodua Myvi was also rebadged as the Daihatsu Sirion for the Indonesian market.
