A sequel to 2013's ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', it is the seventh installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise and stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Jason Statham]]. ''Furious 7'' follows [[Dominic Toretto]] (Diesel), [[Brian O'Conner]] (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the [[United States]] to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in ''Fast & Furious 6'', until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother Owen Shaw, puts the team in danger once again.\n\nWith the previous three installments set between ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006), ''Furious 7'' is the first installment in the franchise to take place after ''Tokyo Drift''. The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a [[single-vehicle crash]] on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast and Furious star Paul Walker killed in car crash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash|work=Guardian|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites and his brothers, Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]], were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news|title=Paul Walker's Surprising Replacement in Fast & Furious 7|url=http://time.com/64024/paul-walker-replacement-fast-furious-7/|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=[[Time.com]]|publisher=Nolan Feeney|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> These script rewrites completed the story arc for Walker's character, which was subsequently retired.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of [[Justin Lin]], who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and blockbuster success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|tenth highest-grossing opening of all time]]. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing [[2015 in film|film of 2015]]<ref>{{cite web|title = 5 Success Lessons Learned From 'Fast and Furious' Franchise|url = http://www.empirehive.com/success-lessons-learned-from-fast-and-furious/|website = EmpireHive|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}</ref> and the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth highest-grossing film of all time]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'', was released on April 14, 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature-length films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAfter defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and securing amnesty for their past crimes,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]''.}} [[Dominic Toretto|Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto]], [[Brian O'Conner]], and the rest of their team have returned to the United States to live normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' FBI office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

Both would be written by [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] and directed by [[Justin Lin]], who had been the franchise's writer and director, respectively, since ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"SequelLaTimes\"/> On December 20, 2011, following the release of ''[[Fast Five]]'', [[Vin Diesel]] stated that ''Fast Six'' would be split into two parts, with writing for the two films occurring simultaneously. On the decision, Diesel said:<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/>\n\n<blockquote>We have to pay off this story, we have to service all of these character relationships, and when we started mapping all that out it just went beyond 110 pages&nbsp; ... &nbsp;The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!'<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, in an interview on February 15, 2012, [[Dwayne Johnson]] stated that the two intended sequels would no longer be filmed simultaneously because of weather issues in filming locations, and that production on ''Fast Seven'' would only begin after the completion of ''Fast Six''.<ref name=\"SequelFeb1512\"/>\n\nIn April 2013, during post-production of the retitled ''Fast & Furious 6'', Lin announced that he would not return to direct a seventh film, as the studio wanted to produce the film on an accelerated schedule for release in summer 2014. This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.

The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a [[single-vehicle crash]] on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast and Furious star Paul Walker killed in car crash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash|work=Guardian|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites and his brothers, Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]], were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news|title=Paul Walker's Surprising Replacement in Fast & Furious 7|url=http://time.com/64024/paul-walker-replacement-fast-furious-7/|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=[[Time.com]]|publisher=Nolan Feeney|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> These script rewrites completed the story arc for Walker's character, which was subsequently retired.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of [[Justin Lin]], who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and blockbuster success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|tenth highest-grossing opening of all time]].

Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' FBI office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.
