Physical therapist practice today is based on a well-developed body of scientific and clinical knowledge. Physical therapists also apply knowledge from the basic, behavior and social sciences. Physical Therapists are autonomous professionals, able to act as first contact practitioners accepting referrals as well as referring patients to other health care professionals.\n\nThe graduate professional education environment is inherently conducive to physical therapist education for many reasons, including the community of scholars, the balance of academic and community life, and the sharing of ideas within a dynamic collegial environment. The moulding of physical therapists must be conducted in an environment that fosters the intellectual challenge and spirit of inquiry characteristic of the community of scholars and in an environment that supports excellence in professional practice. The institutional environment ensures the opportunity for physical therapy to thrive as both an academic and a professional discipline. In the optimum environment, physical therapy upholds and draws upon a tradition of scientific inquiry while contributing to the profession\u2019s body of knowledge.\n\nThe faculty demonstrates a pattern of activity that reflects a commitment to excel in meeting the expectations of the institution, the students, and the profession. The academic environment provides students with opportunities to learn from and be influenced by knowledge outside of, as well as within, physical therapy. In this environment, students become aware of multiple styles of thinking, diverse social concepts, values, and ethical behavior that will help prepare them for identifying, redefining, and fulfilling their responsibilities to society and the profession. Of major importance is emphasis on critical thinking, ethical practice, and provision of culturally competent service to meet the changing needs of society.\n\nUnder Graduate\n\nB. P.

Physical therapist practice today is based on a well-developed body of scientific and clinical knowledge. Physical therapists also apply knowledge from the basic, behavior and social sciences. Physical Therapists are autonomous professionals, able to act as first contact practitioners accepting referrals as well as referring patients to other health care professionals.\n\nThe graduate professional education environment is inherently conducive to physical therapist education for many reasons, including the community of scholars, the balance of academic and community life, and the sharing of ideas within a dynamic collegial environment. The moulding of physical therapists must be conducted in an environment that fosters the intellectual challenge and spirit of inquiry characteristic of the community of scholars and in an environment that supports excellence in professional practice. The institutional environment ensures the opportunity for physical therapy to thrive as both an academic and a professional discipline. In the optimum environment, physical therapy upholds and draws upon a tradition of scientific inquiry while contributing to the profession\u2019s body of knowledge.\n\nThe faculty demonstrates a pattern of activity that reflects a commitment to excel in meeting the expectations of the institution, the students, and the profession. The academic environment provides students with opportunities to learn from and be influenced by knowledge outside of, as well as within, physical therapy. In this environment, students become aware of multiple styles of thinking, diverse social concepts, values, and ethical behavior that will help prepare them for identifying, redefining, and fulfilling their responsibilities to society and the profession. Of major importance is emphasis on critical thinking, ethical practice, and provision of culturally competent service to meet the changing needs of society.\n\nUnder Graduate\n\nB. P.
