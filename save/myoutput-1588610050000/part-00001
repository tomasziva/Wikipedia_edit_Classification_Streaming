The dale is cut into the plateau of Gratton Moor and Smerrill Moor and lies to the north of the hamlet of [[Pikehall]], which is the venue of the annual [[Y Not Festival]].

[[Natural England]] manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the [[White Peak]] ([[Lathkill Dale]], [[Cressbrook Dale]], [[Hay Dale]], Long Dale and [[Monk's Dale]]). The reserve contains [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[elm]] woodland and shrubs including hawthorn and [[Sambucus nigra|elder]]. Abundant flowers include [[Viola lutea|mountain pansy]]. On the spoil heaps of the old lead miines there are rare flowers such as spring sandwort (''Minuartia verna'') and alpine pennycress (''Thlaspi alpestre''). Native grasses include [[Helictotrichon pratense|meadow oat]] and [[Carex panicea|carnation sedge]] interspersed with heather, [[bilberry]] and [[Ulex gallii|dwarf gorse]].
