Building on Royce's reputation established with his cranes they quickly developed a reputation for superior engineering by manufacturing the \"best car in the world\". The [[First World War]] brought them into manufacturing aero-engines. Joint development of [[jet engine]]s began in 1940 and they entered production.\n\nRolls-Royce has built an enduring reputation for development and manufacture of engines for defence and civil aircraft.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Rolls-Royce became hopelessly crippled by the mismanaged development of its advanced [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211]] jet engine and the consequent cost over-runs, though it ultimately proved a great success. In 1971, the owners were obliged to liquidate their business. The useful portions were bought by a new government-owned company named '''Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited''' which continued the core business but sold the holdings in [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) almost immediately and transferred ownership of the profitable but now financially insignificant car division to [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce Motors Holdings Limited]]. This it sold to Vickers in 1980. Rolls-Royce obtained consent to drop 1971 from its name in 1977.\n\nThe Rolls-Royce business remained nationalised until 1987 when, after renaming the owner Rolls-Royce plc, the government sold it to the public. Rolls-Royce plc still owns and operates Rolls-Royce's principal business though since 2003 it is technically a subsidiary of listed [[holding company]] [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce Holdings plc]].\n\nA marketing survey in 1987 showed that only [[Coca-Cola]] was a more widely known [[brand]] than Rolls-Royce.<ref>\"Rolls-Royce shares will fly\".

He made his first car, a two-cylinder Royce 10, in his [[Manchester]] factory in 1904. Henry Royce was introduced to [[Charles Rolls]] at the [[Midland Hotel, Manchester]] on 4 May of that year. Rolls was proprietor of an early motor car dealership, C.S. Rolls & Co. in [[Fulham]].<ref name=TT58775>Rolls-Royce Motors Holdings Limited.

The first Rolls-Royce car, the [[Rolls-Royce 10 hp]], was unveiled at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Salon]] in December 1904.\n\nRolls-Royce Limited was formed on 15 March 1906, by which time it was apparent that new premises were required for production of cars. After considering sites in Manchester, [[Coventry]], [[Bradford]] and [[Leicester]], it was an offer from [[Derby]]'s council of cheap electricity that resulted in the decision to acquire a {{convert|12.7|acre|m2}} site on the southern edge of that city. The new factory was largely designed by Royce, and production began in early 1908, with a formal opening on 9 July 1908 by [[John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu|Sir John Montagu]]. The investment in the new company required further capital to be raised, and on 6 December 1906 \u00a3100,000 of new shares were [[Initial public offering|offered to the public]].

Rolls-Royce stopped production of the new [[Bentley 8 Litre]], which was threatening sales of their current Phantom, disposed of remaining Bentley assets and made use of just the Bentley name and its repute. After some years of development Rolls-Royce produced a new quite different ultra-civilised medium-size range of Bentleys, advertising them as \"the silent sports car\". They were very much in the Rolls-Royce mould. From soon after World War II, until 2002, standard Bentley and Rolls-Royce cars were usually nearly identical \u2013 Bentleys were [[Rebadging|badge engineered]]; only the radiator grille and minor details differed.\n\nIn 1933, the colour of the Rolls-Royce radiator monogram was changed from red to black because the red sometimes clashed with the coachwork colour selected by clients, and not as a mark of respect for the death of Royce as is commonly stated.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Crewe===\nThe British government built a [[British shadow factories|shadow factory]] in [[Crewe]] in 1938 for Rolls-Royce where they could build their [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] and [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon]] aero engines.

Previously they had built only the chassis, leaving the bodies to specialist coach-builders. In 1939, Rolls-Royce brought one of the specialist coachbuilders completely in-house by buying the remaining capital of [[Park Ward|Park Ward Limited]] which, since 1936, in conjunction with Rolls-Royce had been building short production runs of all-metal saloon bodies on Bentley chassis.\n\nIn 1959, Rolls-Royce bought coachbuilder [[H.

When [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914, Rolls-Royce (and many others) were taken by surprise. As a manufacturer of luxury cars, Rolls-Royce was immediately vulnerable, and Claude Johnson thought the bank would withdraw its overdraft facility on which Rolls-Royce depended at that time. Nevertheless, believing that war was likely to be short-lived the directors initially decided not to seek government work making aero engines. However, this position was quickly reversed and Rolls-Royce was persuaded by the [[War Office]] to manufacture fifty air-cooled [[V8 engine]]s under licence from [[Renault]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/> Meanwhile, the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Royal Aircraft Factory]] asked Rolls-Royce to design a new {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} engine. Despite initial reluctance, they agreed, and during 1915, developed Rolls-Royce's first aero engine, the twelve-cylinder [[Rolls-Royce Eagle|Eagle]]. This was quickly followed by the smaller six-cylinder [[Rolls-Royce Hawk|Hawk]], the {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Falcon|Falcon]] and, just before the end of the war, the larger {{convert|675|hp|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Condor|Condor]].\n\nThroughout World War I, Rolls-Royce struggled to build aero engines in the quantities required by the [[War Office]]. However, with the exception of [[Straker-Squire|Brazil Straker]] in Bristol Rolls-Royce resisted pressure to license production to other manufacturers, fearing that the engines' much admired quality and reliability would risk being compromised. Instead the Derby factory was extended to enable Rolls-Royce to increase its own production rates.<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/>  By the late 1920s, aero engines made up most of Rolls-Royce's business.\n\nHenry Royce's last design was the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] aero engine, which was first flown in prototype form in 1935, although he had died in 1933. This was developed from the [[Rolls-Royce R|R]] engine, which had powered a record-breaking [[Supermarine]] [[Supermarine S.6B|S.6B seaplane]] to almost {{convert|400|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the 1931 [[Schneider Trophy]]. The Merlin was a powerful supercharged V12 engine and was fitted into many [[World War II]] aircraft: the British [[Hawker Hurricane]], [[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[de Havilland Mosquito]] (twin-engine), [[Avro Lancaster]] (four-engine) (a development of the Avro Manchester with its unreliable [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] engines), [[Vickers Wellington]] (twin-engine); it also transformed the American [[North American P-51 Mustang]] into a competitor for the best fighter of its time, its engine a Merlin engine built by [[Packard]] under licence. Over 160,000 Merlin engines were produced, including over 30,000 by the [[Ford Motor Company]] at Trafford Park, Manchester. During the war most Rolls-Royce flight testing of engines was carried out from [[Hucknall Aerodrome]]. The Merlin crossed over into military land-vehicle use as the [[Rolls Royce Meteor|Meteor]] powering the [[Centurion tank]] among others. Many Meteor engines used engine blocks and parts that failed requirements for high performance engines, but were suitable for use in the derated {{convert|480|kW|abbr=on}} Meteor.\n\nIn December 1942 over a \u201cfive-shilling meal\u201d at the [http://www.swanandroyal.co.uk/wp/ Swan and Royal] in [[Clitheroe]], [[Stanley Hooker]] and [[Ernest Hives, 1st Baron Hives|Ernest Hives]] of Rolls-Royce agreed with [[Spencer Wilks]] of the Rover Car Company that Rolls-Royce would take over top secret work on the development of the jet engine. <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Historic Pub is up for sale|last=|first=|date=1 February 2020|work=Lancashire Evening Post|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>An exchange of assets followed with [[Rover Company|Rover]] and in the post-[[World War II]] period Rolls-Royce made significant advances in [[gas turbine]] engine design and manufacture. The ''[[Rolls-Royce Dart|Dart]]'' and ''[[Rolls-Royce Tyne|Tyne]]'' [[turboprop]] engines were particularly important, enabling airlines to cut times for shorter journeys whilst jet [[airliner]]s were introduced on longer services. The Dart engine was used in [[Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy]], [[Avro 748]], [[Fokker F27 Friendship]], [[Handley Page Herald]] and [[Vickers Viscount]] aircraft, whilst the more powerful Tyne powered the [[Breguet Atlantique]], [[Transall C-160]], [[Short Belfast]], and [[Vickers Vanguard]], and the [[SR.N4]] [[hovercraft]]. Many of these turboprops are still in service.\n\nAmongst the [[jet engine]]s of this period was the [[Rolls-Royce Spey|RB163 Spey]], which powers the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]], [[BAC One-Eleven]], [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] and [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]].\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s there was a significant rationalisation of all aspects of British aerospace and this included aero-engine manufacturers. In 1966 Rolls-Royce acquired [[Bristol Siddeley]] (which had resulted from the merger of [[Armstrong Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Aero Engines]] in 1959) and incorporated it as the Bristol Siddeley division. Bristol Siddeley, with its principal factory at [[Filton]], near [[Bristol]], had a strong base in military engines, including the [[Rolls Royce Olympus|Olympus]], [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper|Viper]], [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]] (vectored thrust) and [[Bristol Orpheus|Orpheus]]. They were also manufacturing the [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593|Olympus 593 Mk610]] to be used in [[Concorde]] in collaboration with SNECMA. They also had a turbofan project with SNECMA.\n\n[[Leavesden Aerodrome]], Watford was originally owned by the [[Ministry of Defence (1947\u20131964)|Ministry of Defence]] and used during World War II for the manufacture of Mosquito and Halifax aircraft. For a number of years, Rolls-Royce used the site for the manufacture of helicopter engines until the site closed in June 1993. The former Rolls-Royce factory at Watford is now known as the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]] and has produced world-famous films, including the [[James Bond]], ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series.\n\n==RB211\u2014the 1971 receivership and nationalisation==\n[[File:Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engine (5343788626).jpg|thumb|RB211 Derby museum display.<br>Forty years after nationalisation its versions still powered around half of the long-haul airliners in service]]\n\nThe amalgamations and disappearances of the 1950s and 1960s left a small number of major airframe manufacturers based in only a few countries. The competition for the very large contracts to supply their engines grew intense. Expensive research and development became vital. Real profits came from the maintenance contracts which might peak a whole human generation later. By the 1980s it was said that each generation of aero engines cost around 10 times that of its parent.<ref>Rolls-Royce for the unsentimental.

Building on Royce's reputation established with his cranes they quickly developed a reputation for superior engineering by manufacturing the \"best car in the world\". The [[First World War]] brought them into manufacturing aero-engines. Joint development of [[jet engine]]s began in 1940 and they entered production.\n\nRolls-Royce has built an enduring reputation for development and manufacture of engines for defence and civil aircraft.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Rolls-Royce became hopelessly crippled by the mismanaged development of its advanced [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211]] jet engine and the consequent cost over-runs, though it ultimately proved a great success. In 1971, the owners were obliged to liquidate their business. The useful portions were bought by a new government-owned company named '''Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited''' which continued the core business but sold the holdings in [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC) almost immediately and transferred ownership of the profitable but now financially insignificant car division to [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce Motors Holdings Limited]]. This it sold to Vickers in 1980. Rolls-Royce obtained consent to drop 1971 from its name in 1977.\n\nThe Rolls-Royce business remained nationalised until 1987 when, after renaming the owner Rolls-Royce plc, the government sold it to the public. Rolls-Royce plc still owns and operates Rolls-Royce's principal business though since 2003 it is technically a subsidiary of listed [[holding company]] [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce Holdings plc]].\n\nA marketing survey in 1987 showed that only [[Coca-Cola]] was a more widely known [[brand]] than Rolls-Royce.<ref>\"Rolls-Royce shares will fly\". ''The Times'', Wednesday, April 29, 1987; p. 25; Issue 62755</ref>\n\n==Motor cars==\n[[Henry Royce]] started an electrical and mechanical business in 1884. He made his first car, a two-cylinder Royce 10, in his [[Manchester]] factory in 1904. Henry Royce was introduced to [[Charles Rolls]] at the [[Midland Hotel, Manchester]] on 4 May of that year. Rolls was proprietor of an early motor car dealership, C.S. Rolls & Co. in [[Fulham]].<ref name=TT58775>Rolls-Royce Motors Holdings Limited.

The first Rolls-Royce car, the [[Rolls-Royce 10 hp]], was unveiled at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Salon]] in December 1904.\n\nRolls-Royce Limited was formed on 15 March 1906, by which time it was apparent that new premises were required for production of cars. After considering sites in Manchester, [[Coventry]], [[Bradford]] and [[Leicester]], it was an offer from [[Derby]]'s council of cheap electricity that resulted in the decision to acquire a {{convert|12.7|acre|m2}} site on the southern edge of that city. The new factory was largely designed by Royce, and production began in early 1908, with a formal opening on 9 July 1908 by [[John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu|Sir John Montagu]]. The investment in the new company required further capital to be raised, and on 6 December 1906 \u00a3100,000 of new shares were [[Initial public offering|offered to the public]].

Rolls-Royce stopped production of the new [[Bentley 8 Litre]], which was threatening sales of their current Phantom, disposed of remaining Bentley assets and made use of just the Bentley name and its repute. After some years of development Rolls-Royce produced a new quite different ultra-civilised medium-size range of Bentleys, advertising them as \"the silent sports car\". They were very much in the Rolls-Royce mould. From soon after World War II, until 2002, standard Bentley and Rolls-Royce cars were usually nearly identical \u2013 Bentleys were [[Rebadging|badge engineered]]; only the radiator grille and minor details differed.\n\nIn 1933, the colour of the Rolls-Royce radiator monogram was changed from red to black because the red sometimes clashed with the coachwork colour selected by clients, and not as a mark of respect for the death of Royce as is commonly stated.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Crewe===\nThe British government built a [[British shadow factories|shadow factory]] in [[Crewe]] in 1938 for Rolls-Royce where they could build their [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] and [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon]] aero engines. Car production was moved there in 1946 for space to construct bodies and to leave space for aero engines at Derby. The site was bought from the government in 1973.<ref name=TT58775/> It is now [[Bentley Crewe]].\n\n===Second World War===\n\nIn 1940, a contract was signed with the [[Packard| Packard Motor Car Company]] in Detroit, Michigan, for the production of Merlin aero-engines for [[World War II]] in the USA.\n\nProduction focused on aero engines but a variant of the Merlin engine, known as the [[Rolls-Royce Meteor|Meteor]], was developed for the [[Cromwell tank]].

Previously they had built only the chassis, leaving the bodies to specialist coach-builders. In 1939, Rolls-Royce brought one of the specialist coachbuilders completely in-house by buying the remaining capital of [[Park Ward|Park Ward Limited]] which, since 1936, in conjunction with Rolls-Royce had been building short production runs of all-metal saloon bodies on Bentley chassis.\n\nIn 1959, Rolls-Royce bought coachbuilder [[H.

When [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914, Rolls-Royce (and many others) were taken by surprise. As a manufacturer of luxury cars, Rolls-Royce was immediately vulnerable, and Claude Johnson thought the bank would withdraw its overdraft facility on which Rolls-Royce depended at that time. Nevertheless, believing that war was likely to be short-lived the directors initially decided not to seek government work making aero engines. However, this position was quickly reversed and Rolls-Royce was persuaded by the [[War Office]] to manufacture fifty air-cooled [[V8 engine]]s under licence from [[Renault]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/> Meanwhile, the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Royal Aircraft Factory]] asked Rolls-Royce to design a new {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} engine. Despite initial reluctance, they agreed, and during 1915, developed Rolls-Royce's first aero engine, the twelve-cylinder [[Rolls-Royce Eagle|Eagle]]. This was quickly followed by the smaller six-cylinder [[Rolls-Royce Hawk|Hawk]], the {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Falcon|Falcon]] and, just before the end of the war, the larger {{convert|675|hp|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Condor|Condor]].\n\nThroughout World War I, Rolls-Royce struggled to build aero engines in the quantities required by the [[War Office]]. However, with the exception of [[Straker-Squire|Brazil Straker]] in Bristol Rolls-Royce resisted pressure to license production to other manufacturers, fearing that the engines' much admired quality and reliability would risk being compromised. Instead the Derby factory was extended to enable Rolls-Royce to increase its own production rates.<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/>  By the late 1920s, aero engines made up most of Rolls-Royce's business.\n\nHenry Royce's last design was the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] aero engine, which was first flown in prototype form in 1935, although he had died in 1933. This was developed from the [[Rolls-Royce R|R]] engine, which had powered a record-breaking [[Supermarine]] [[Supermarine S.6B|S.6B seaplane]] to almost {{convert|400|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the 1931 [[Schneider Trophy]]. The Merlin was a powerful supercharged V12 engine and was fitted into many [[World War II]] aircraft: the British [[Hawker Hurricane]], [[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[de Havilland Mosquito]] (twin-engine), [[Avro Lancaster]] (four-engine) (a development of the Avro Manchester with its unreliable [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] engines), [[Vickers Wellington]] (twin-engine); it also transformed the American [[North American P-51 Mustang]] into a competitor for the best fighter of its time, its engine a Merlin engine built by [[Packard]] under licence. Over 160,000 Merlin engines were produced, including over 30,000 by the [[Ford Motor Company]] at Trafford Park, Manchester. During the war most Rolls-Royce flight testing of engines was carried out from [[Hucknall Aerodrome]]. The Merlin crossed over into military land-vehicle use as the [[Rolls Royce Meteor|Meteor]] powering the [[Centurion tank]] among others. Many Meteor engines used engine blocks and parts that failed requirements for high performance engines, but were suitable for use in the derated {{convert|480|kW|abbr=on}} Meteor.\n\nIn December 1942 over a \u201cfive-shilling meal\u201d at the [http://www.swanandroyal.co.uk/wp/ Swan and Royal] in [[Clitheroe]], [[Stanley Hooker]] and [[Ernest Hives, 1st Baron Hives|Ernest Hives]] of Rolls-Royce agreed with [[Spencer Wilks]] of the Rover Car Company that Rolls-Royce would take over top secret work on the development of the jet engine. <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Historic Pub is up for sale|last=|first=|date=1 February 2020|work=Lancashire Evening Post|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>An exchange of assets followed with [[Rover Company|Rover]] and in the post-[[World War II]] period Rolls-Royce made significant advances in [[gas turbine]] engine design and manufacture. The ''[[Rolls-Royce Dart|Dart]]'' and ''[[Rolls-Royce Tyne|Tyne]]'' [[turboprop]] engines were particularly important, enabling airlines to cut times for shorter journeys whilst jet [[airliner]]s were introduced on longer services. The Dart engine was used in [[Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy]], [[Avro 748]], [[Fokker F27 Friendship]], [[Handley Page Herald]] and [[Vickers Viscount]] aircraft, whilst the more powerful Tyne powered the [[Breguet Atlantique]], [[Transall C-160]], [[Short Belfast]], and [[Vickers Vanguard]], and the [[SR.N4]] [[hovercraft]]. Many of these turboprops are still in service.\n\nAmongst the [[jet engine]]s of this period was the [[Rolls-Royce Spey|RB163 Spey]], which powers the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]], [[BAC One-Eleven]], [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] and [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]].\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s there was a significant rationalisation of all aspects of British aerospace and this included aero-engine manufacturers. In 1966 Rolls-Royce acquired [[Bristol Siddeley]] (which had resulted from the merger of [[Armstrong Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Aero Engines]] in 1959) and incorporated it as the Bristol Siddeley division. Bristol Siddeley, with its principal factory at [[Filton]], near [[Bristol]], had a strong base in military engines, including the [[Rolls Royce Olympus|Olympus]], [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper|Viper]], [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]] (vectored thrust) and [[Bristol Orpheus|Orpheus]]. They were also manufacturing the [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593|Olympus 593 Mk610]] to be used in [[Concorde]] in collaboration with SNECMA. They also had a turbofan project with SNECMA.\n\n[[Leavesden Aerodrome]], Watford was originally owned by the [[Ministry of Defence (1947\u20131964)|Ministry of Defence]] and used during World War II for the manufacture of Mosquito and Halifax aircraft. For a number of years, Rolls-Royce used the site for the manufacture of helicopter engines until the site closed in June 1993. The former Rolls-Royce factory at Watford is now known as the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]] and has produced world-famous films, including the [[James Bond]], ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series.\n\n==RB211\u2014the 1971 receivership and nationalisation==\n[[File:Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engine (5343788626).jpg|thumb|RB211 Derby museum display.<br>Forty years after nationalisation its versions still powered around half of the long-haul airliners in service]]\n\nThe amalgamations and disappearances of the 1950s and 1960s left a small number of major airframe manufacturers based in only a few countries. The competition for the very large contracts to supply their engines grew intense. Expensive research and development became vital. Real profits came from the maintenance contracts which might peak a whole human generation later. By the 1980s it was said that each generation of aero engines cost around 10 times that of its parent.<ref>Rolls-Royce for the unsentimental.

In the preceding five years about 70 percent of production went outside the United Kingdom.<ref name =DT41009/>\n\n===Competition===\nRolls-Royce's competitors were [[GE]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]] (UTC). Aero engines were then only a part of GE and UTC activities as major industrial groups. \n:Others included [[SNECMA]], [[Turbomeca]], [[MTU Aero Engines|MTU]], [[Fiat Aviazione]] in Europe and USA's [[Avco]], [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] and General Motors' [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]].  Despite the field being exceptionally competitive, a number of the smaller manufacturers were already in collaboration with GE or with other smaller manufacturers, as was Rolls-Royce as well.<ref name =DT41009/>\n\n===Divisions and products===\nAt that time Rolls-Royce was organised into five business groups:\n:1. ICEG Civil Aero \u2014 demand governed by airline activity and profitability\n:*major engines in 1987: \n::RB211-524, 535 series;\n::IAE V2500 for Airbus A320, a consortium of Rolls-Royce 30%, Pratt & Whitney 30%, [[Japanese Aero Engine Corporation|JAEC]] 23%, MTU 11% and Fiat 6%\n::Tay, a development of the Spey superfan\n:*engines out of production but generating a significant demand for spares\n::Avon (1951), Conway (1960), Dart (1953), Olympus 593 (1976), RB211-22B (1972), Spey (1964), Tyne (1960)\n:2. MEG Military Aero \u2014 demand had been stable recently and so of major importance to Rolls-Royce\n:*major engines in 1987: \n::RB199\n::Pegasus (with vectored thrust for VTOL combat aircraft)\n::Adour\n::Spey\n::Viper\n:*helicopter engines\n::Gnome\n::Gem\n::RTM322\n::EJ200\n:*missile engines\n::Odin\n\n:3.
