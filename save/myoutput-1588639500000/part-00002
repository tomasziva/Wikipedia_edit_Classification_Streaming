Throughout the world, most top female athletes are not paid, and work full-time or part-time jobs in addition to their training, practice and competition schedules. '''Women's professional sports''' organizations defy this trend.  Such organizations are relatively new, and are most common in very economically developed countries, where investors are available to buy teams, and businesses can afford to sponsor them in exchange for publicity and promotion of their products. Very few governments support [[professional sports]], male or female.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Participation of women in the Olympics}}\n[[File:Halina Konopacka 1928.jpg|thumb|150px|Poland's [[Halina Konopacka]] participating in women's [[discus throw]] event at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], in which she went on to win the gold medal.]]\n\nFrom the 1800s there has been outlook of women being seen as delicate or weaker, whose purpose, drive, and energizes should solely be directed towards bearing and raising of children. Medical rationalities of the time presented concerns on the effects of what may happen to a female's reproductive system and functionality if women were to participate in sports. \u201cViolent movements of the body can cause a shift in the position and a loosening of the uterus as well as prolapse and bleeding, with resulting sterility, thus defeating a woman\u2019s true purpose in life, i.e. the bringing forth of strong children.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pfister|first=Gertrud|date=1990|title=The Medical Discourse on Female Physical Culture in Germany in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=17|issue=2|pages=183\u2013198|issn=0094-1700|jstor=43611566}}</ref> The theory of frailty communicates women to naturally be weaker and frail in comparison to men.

Though who are \u201cunattractive girls are comparatively good sports. Pretty girls are not.

In 1902 the United States Lawn Tennis Association changed woman's five sets matches that the male athletes play presently to best of three sets format. Dictated by the unsettlement of the rigorous work that women could not keep up with in accordance to the men's games.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, a few women gained enough recognition for their athletic talent and social acceptance as role models to earn a living playing sports. Most of these were in the [[United States]]. Among them was [[Joan Weston]], a [[roller derby]] star who was once the highest paid female in sports, but she was the exception rather than the rule.\n\nThings began to change in 1973 when [[Billie Jean King]] won \"the [[The Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]]\" and cracked the [[glass ceiling]] on pay for female athletes. Other players, like [[Martina Navratilova]], broke through that ceiling, decreasing the gap between women and men athlete's pay on a regular basis rather than occasionally.\n\nEven now, in the 21st century, most professional women athletes around the world receive very little notoriety or pay compared to men.  ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' acknowledged the importance of King's achievement in 1990 by naming her one of the \"100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century.\"\n\n===Associations===\n'''United Women's Sports''' LLC ('''UWS''') is a [[professional sports]] company founded in 2016 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], United States. Operating women's professional sports leagues as a financially sustainable sports entertainment product, UWS works toward raising awareness of women in sport. Part of its mission also includes providing opportunities for women to work in sports, including disciplines such as Marketing, On-Air, Production, Operations and Finance.\n\nFounded by [[Digit Murphy]], she serves as Chief Executive Officer, while Aronda Kirby, a former General Manager with the [[Boston Blades]], holds the title of Chief Operations Officer, their first venture involved lacrosse, with the launch of [[UWLX]] taking place in the summer of 2016. In the aftermath of the inaugural season, the Long Island Sound emerged as league champions.\n\nIn addition to the [[UWLX]], Murphy and Kirby are both co-founders of the Play It Forward Sports Foundation, with the goal of advancing gender equity in sports at all levels of play. With the objective of providing more opportunities for women in sport as professional athletes, coaches and managers, the model for Play It Forward Sports also allows female athletes a chance to participate in the community by educating, training and mentoring young female athletes, providing them with earning potential.\n\nAthlete ambassadors for Play It Forward include [[Molly Schaus]], along with tennis players Neha Uberoi and Shikha Uberoi. In addition, Schaus is part of the Foundation's Board, which includes Valarie Gelb, Debbie Mckay and John Mayers.\n\n==United States==\n\nThough women have been pro athletes in the United States, since the early 1900s, paid teams, leagues and athletes are still uncommon and, as of 2013, paid far less than their male counterparts. For instance, the  [[WNBA|Women's National Basketball Association]] had its first season in 1997, 51 years after inception of the men's [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. The WNBA (under the NBA Board of Governors) pays the top women players 60 times less than the top men. In 2005, the WNBA team salary cap was $0.673 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://womensbasketballonline.com/wnba/rosters/salary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801060900/http://womensbasketballonline.com/wnba/rosters/salary.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 }}</ref> The  [[NBA]] cap was over 60 times higher, at $43.87 million.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nba.com/blazers/news/Salary_Cap_101-147720-41.html |title = Portland Trail Blazers News Headlines}}</ref> The [[Women's United Soccer Association]] became the first American women's pro league in 2001, but lasted only briefly because of financial sponsorship.

Absence of a [[Women's professional football (soccer)]] league in the United States made it difficult for the Soccer women's national football team to find new players until [[Women's Professional Soccer]] was founded. A 2004 effort to revive the WUSA <ref>http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=328319&root=wusa&cc=5739</ref> was launched. On September 4, 2007, a new North American women's professional football league, tentatively named Women's Soccer LLC, was announced,<ref>http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=PRNI2&STORY=/www/story/09-04-2007/0004655869&EDATE=</ref> and ultimately launched in 2009 as [[Women's Professional Soccer]]. That league folded after its 2012 season, with the current [[National Women's Soccer League]] established later that year and beginning play in 2013.\n\nAs of 2019, the only sports that men but not women play professionally in the United States are football and baseball.\n\n===Association football===\nThe [[Women's Professional Soccer]] league, formed in September 2007, began its league play in March 2009.<ref>[http://www.womensprosoccer.com/about/about-wps Women's Professional Football About Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220050113/http://www.womensprosoccer.com/about/about-wps |date=2010-02-20 }}, womensprosoccer.com/about/about-wps .</ref> In its final season in 2011, there were six teams in the eastern United States. The WPS canceled the 2012 season when the number of teams dropped to five after [[Dan Borislow]]'s team in South Florida magicJack was terminated by the league. The WPS hoped to continue the season in 2013 with at least six teams and eight in the 2014 season, but ultimately folded in May 2012 because of legal and financial troubles.\n\nIn November 2012, the US, Mexican and Canadian soccer federations announced the establishment of the [[National Women's Soccer League]] which began play in 2013. The US and Canadian federations remain involved with the NWSL; the Mexican federation withdrew after establishing [[Liga MX Femenil]] in 2016.\n\nThe National Women's Soccer team saw the loss of the [[Boston Breakers]] in January 2018.

It was such a success that the number of people who attended women's baseball games reached almost 1 million in 1948. Yet, when the war ended and Major League Baseball players came back home, female baseball players were obliged to fill the role of housewife at home. AAGPBL lost its audience, struggled with finances, and ceased to exist in 1954.\n\nForty years later, in 1994, a businessman in [[Atlanta]] struck a $3 million sponsorship deal with [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] and formed a women's professional baseball team called the [[Colorado Silver Bullets]]. About 20 members were selected from 1,300 baseball players nationwide for this team. The Bullets played games with men's semiprofessional teams and regional teams. After the birth of the [[Ladies League Baseball]] in 1997, it included four teams. The Bullets fought with them.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe Ladies League Baseball changed its name into the Ladies Pro Baseball and added two teams into the league in 1998. However, after the first month, the league was suspended due to the financial difficulties of its sponsors. The Bullets folded in 1998 after Coors terminated its contract.\n\n===Basketball===\nThere are many countries where women's professional basketball league exists besides the United States, such as Italy, Germany, Spain, and Brazil. Many Americans players went overseas and some [[WNBA]]  players play basketball in foreign countries during [[WNBA]]'s off-season.\n\nThe [[Women's Professional Basketball League]] (WBL) was a professional women's basketball league in the United States. The league played three seasons from the fall of 1978 to the spring of 1981. The league is generally considered to be the first American professional women's basketball league to be founded. The next league was the [[Women's American Basketball Association]] and the [[Women's Basketball Association]] (WBA) <ref>.

The league played two full season (1996\u201397 and 1997\u201398) and started a third (1998\u201399) before it folded on December 22, 1998.\n\n===Golf===\n[[File:2009 LPGA Championship - Vicky Hurst (1).jpg|thumb|120px|left|USA's [[Vicky Hurst]] playing golf at [[LPGA]], 2009.]]\n\nThe [[LPGA]] (Ladies Professional Golf Association) was founded in 1950 and is the longest running women's professional sports association.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?pid=59 |title = 404 &#124; LPGA &#124; Ladies Professional Golf Association}}</ref>\n\n===Horse racing===\nIn 1906 Lula Olive Gill became the first female jockey to win a horse race in California; later that same year, Ada Evans Dean rode her own horse to victory after her jockey had become ill.

A journalist, from ''Femina,'' went to cover the match and not long after the magazine was in a general meeting with those women establishing an association for women's football. A year later, ''Femina,'' stopped providing financial support to the association. The women created the own union, ''Dansk Kvindelig Fodbold Union'' (the Danish Women's Football Union, or DKFU).

The major women's clubs competing are affiliates of male club counterparts, usually bearing the same names with the acronyms LFC or WFC, but they do not share the same large stadiums, instead renting smaller stadiums from lower-level clubs (no women's club actually owns their stadium). The competition is semi-professional, meaning that the players are paid above the old maximum for professionals but rely on part-time jobs or schooling outside the game. Full professionalism has been tried, mostly on the part of individual teams ([[Fulham L.F.C.]] was the first side to go full pro, but was downgraded later by the owners), but it will take years to develop a fully professionalised women's league in England. Backing by a male club does not necessarily equal success, and the level of success achieved by male clubs may be reversed in female counterparts (compare these local derbies: [[Second City derby|Aston Villa vs. Birmingham City]]; [[Bristol derby|Bristol City vs. Bristol Rovers]]; [[Merseyside derby|Liverpool vs. Everton]]; and [[Tyne-Wear derby|Sunderland vs. Newcastle United]]).\n\nSimilar semi-professionalism examples exist in women's [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]].

South America is mostly overseen by the South American Football Association, or [[CONMEBOL]], while Mexico, Central America, and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean are overseen by [[CONCACAF]]. Both organizations have categories for male and female players. CONMEBOL also organizes the [[Copa Libertadores Femenina]] competition for club teams, while CONCACAF currently has no women's club competition.

Throughout the world, most top female athletes are not paid, and work full-time or part-time jobs in addition to their training, practice and competition schedules. '''Women's professional sports''' organizations defy this trend.  Such organizations are relatively new, and are most common in very economically developed countries, where investors are available to buy teams, and businesses can afford to sponsor them in exchange for publicity and promotion of their products. Very few governments support [[professional sports]], male or female.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Participation of women in the Olympics}}\n[[File:Halina Konopacka 1928.jpg|thumb|150px|Poland's [[Halina Konopacka]] participating in women's [[discus throw]] event at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], in which she went on to win the gold medal.]]\n\nFrom the 1800s there has been outlook of women being seen as delicate or weaker, whose purpose, drive, and energizes should solely be directed towards bearing and raising of children. Medical rationalities of the time presented concerns on the effects of what may happen to a female's reproductive system and functionality if women were to participate in sports. \u201cViolent movements of the body can cause a shift in the position and a loosening of the uterus as well as prolapse and bleeding, with resulting sterility, thus defeating a woman\u2019s true purpose in life, i.e. the bringing forth of strong children.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pfister|first=Gertrud|date=1990|title=The Medical Discourse on Female Physical Culture in Germany in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=17|issue=2|pages=183\u2013198|issn=0094-1700|jstor=43611566}}</ref> The theory of frailty communicates women to naturally be weaker and frail in comparison to men.

Dictated by the unsettlement of the rigorous work that women could not keep up with in accordance to the men's games.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, a few women gained enough recognition for their athletic talent and social acceptance as role models to earn a living playing sports. Most of these were in the [[United States]]. Among them was [[Joan Weston]], a [[roller derby]] star who was once the highest paid female in sports, but she was the exception rather than the rule.\n\nThings began to change in 1973 when [[Billie Jean King]] won \"the [[The Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]]\" and cracked the [[glass ceiling]] on pay for female athletes. Other players, like [[Martina Navratilova]], broke through that ceiling, decreasing the gap between women and men athlete's pay on a regular basis rather than occasionally.\n\nEven now, in the 21st century, most professional women athletes around the world receive very little notoriety or pay compared to men.  ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' acknowledged the importance of King's achievement in 1990 by naming her one of the \"100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century.\"\n\n===Associations===\n'''United Women's Sports''' LLC ('''UWS''') is a [[professional sports]] company founded in 2016 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], United States. Operating women's professional sports leagues as a financially sustainable sports entertainment product, UWS works toward raising awareness of women in sport. Part of its mission also includes providing opportunities for women to work in sports, including disciplines such as Marketing, On-Air, Production, Operations and Finance.\n\nFounded by [[Digit Murphy]], she serves as Chief Executive Officer, while Aronda Kirby, a former General Manager with the [[Boston Blades]], holds the title of Chief Operations Officer, their first venture involved lacrosse, with the launch of [[UWLX]] taking place in the summer of 2016. In the aftermath of the inaugural season, the Long Island Sound emerged as league champions.\n\nIn addition to the [[UWLX]], Murphy and Kirby are both co-founders of the Play It Forward Sports Foundation, with the goal of advancing gender equity in sports at all levels of play. With the objective of providing more opportunities for women in sport as professional athletes, coaches and managers, the model for Play It Forward Sports also allows female athletes a chance to participate in the community by educating, training and mentoring young female athletes, providing them with earning potential.\n\nAthlete ambassadors for Play It Forward include [[Molly Schaus]], along with tennis players Neha Uberoi and Shikha Uberoi. In addition, Schaus is part of the Foundation's Board, which includes Valarie Gelb, Debbie Mckay and John Mayers.\n\n==United States==\n\nThough women have been pro athletes in the United States, since the early 1900s, paid teams, leagues and athletes are still uncommon and, as of 2013, paid far less than their male counterparts. For instance, the  [[WNBA|Women's National Basketball Association]] had its first season in 1997, 51 years after inception of the men's [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. The WNBA (under the NBA Board of Governors) pays the top women players 60 times less than the top men.

Absence of a [[Women's professional football (soccer)]] league in the United States made it difficult for the Soccer women's national football team to find new players until [[Women's Professional Soccer]] was founded. A 2004 effort to revive the WUSA <ref>http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=328319&root=wusa&cc=5739</ref> was launched. On September 4, 2007, a new North American women's professional football league, tentatively named Women's Soccer LLC, was announced,<ref>http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=PRNI2&STORY=/www/story/09-04-2007/0004655869&EDATE=</ref> and ultimately launched in 2009 as [[Women's Professional Soccer]]. That league folded after its 2012 season, with the current [[National Women's Soccer League]] established later that year and beginning play in 2013.\n\nAs of 2019, the only sports that men but not women play professionally in the United States are football and baseball.\n\n===Association football===\nThe [[Women's Professional Soccer]] league, formed in September 2007, began its league play in March 2009.<ref>[http://www.womensprosoccer.com/about/about-wps Women's Professional Football About Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220050113/http://www.womensprosoccer.com/about/about-wps |date=2010-02-20 }}, womensprosoccer.com/about/about-wps .</ref> In its final season in 2011, there were six teams in the eastern United States. The WPS canceled the 2012 season when the number of teams dropped to five after [[Dan Borislow]]'s team in South Florida magicJack was terminated by the league. The WPS hoped to continue the season in 2013 with at least six teams and eight in the 2014 season, but ultimately folded in May 2012 because of legal and financial troubles.\n\nIn November 2012, the US, Mexican and Canadian soccer federations announced the establishment of the [[National Women's Soccer League]] which began play in 2013. The US and Canadian federations remain involved with the NWSL; the Mexican federation withdrew after establishing [[Liga MX Femenil]] in 2016.\n\nThe National Women's Soccer team saw the loss of the [[Boston Breakers]] in January 2018.

It was such a success that the number of people who attended women's baseball games reached almost 1 million in 1948. Yet, when the war ended and Major League Baseball players came back home, female baseball players were obliged to fill the role of housewife at home. AAGPBL lost its audience, struggled with finances, and ceased to exist in 1954.\n\nForty years later, in 1994, a businessman in [[Atlanta]] struck a $3 million sponsorship deal with [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] and formed a women's professional baseball team called the [[Colorado Silver Bullets]]. About 20 members were selected from 1,300 baseball players nationwide for this team. The Bullets played games with men's semiprofessional teams and regional teams. After the birth of the [[Ladies League Baseball]] in 1997, it included four teams. The Bullets fought with them.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe Ladies League Baseball changed its name into the Ladies Pro Baseball and added two teams into the league in 1998.

The Bullets folded in 1998 after Coors terminated its contract.\n\n===Basketball===\nThere are many countries where women's professional basketball league exists besides the United States, such as Italy, Germany, Spain, and Brazil. Many Americans players went overseas and some [[WNBA]]  players play basketball in foreign countries during [[WNBA]]'s off-season.\n\nThe [[Women's Professional Basketball League]] (WBL) was a professional women's basketball league in the United States. The league played three seasons from the fall of 1978 to the spring of 1981. The league is generally considered to be the first American professional women's basketball league to be founded. The next league was the [[Women's American Basketball Association]] and the [[Women's Basketball Association]] (WBA) <ref>.

In the 1900s, more teams started to emerge for women. A majority of the groups were lawn bowls and golf clubs, but in 1930s, athletic clubs were created such as track and field.

Also, in the span of those 10 years society worked hard to make sure women's football was taken more seriously and that more matches were planned between women's teams.

A journalist, from ''Femina,'' went to cover the match and not long after the magazine was in a general meeting with those women establishing an association for women's football. A year later, ''Femina,'' stopped providing financial support to the association. The women created the own union, ''Dansk Kvindelig Fodbold Union'' (the Danish Women's Football Union, or DKFU).

The major women's clubs competing are affiliates of male club counterparts, usually bearing the same names with the acronyms LFC or WFC, but they do not share the same large stadiums, instead renting smaller stadiums from lower-level clubs (no women's club actually owns their stadium). The competition is semi-professional, meaning that the players are paid above the old maximum for professionals but rely on part-time jobs or schooling outside the game. Full professionalism has been tried, mostly on the part of individual teams ([[Fulham L.F.C.]] was the first side to go full pro, but was downgraded later by the owners), but it will take years to develop a fully professionalised women's league in England. Backing by a male club does not necessarily equal success, and the level of success achieved by male clubs may be reversed in female counterparts (compare these local derbies: [[Second City derby|Aston Villa vs. Birmingham City]]; [[Bristol derby|Bristol City vs. Bristol Rovers]]; [[Merseyside derby|Liverpool vs. Everton]]; and [[Tyne-Wear derby|Sunderland vs. Newcastle United]]).\n\nSimilar semi-professionalism examples exist in women's [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]].

Men hold more coaching positions than women, regardless of the gender of the sport, although the gender of the team's head coach has been shown not to impact team or individual player performance.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|date=April 2018|title=Are Men Better Leaders?

For example, in Norway women made up 14% of elite level coaching positions in 2018.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThese representation gaps reflect traditional societal gender stereotypes. One explanation for this is the stereotypical association of sports with masculinity: in coaching, traditionally expected masculine attributes such as dominance, aggressiveness, and independence are considered to be more desirable in head coaches when compared with traditionally expected feminine attributes such as affection, sympathy, and timidness.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Fasting|first=Kari|date=2017|title=Norwegian Elite-Level Coaches: Who Are They?|url=https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2470131/FastingSSSF2017.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Scandinavian Sports Studies|volume=8|pages=29\u201347|via=}}</ref> As of 2018 outside of basketball, fewer than 5 percent of men's teams are coached by women, and they are primarily at smaller universities.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Gender wage gap ===\n[[File:Maria Sharapova at 2009 Roland Garros, Paris, France.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Maria Sharapova]] in action at [[French Open]], 2009.

The coaching wage gap exists when comparing female sports programs with male programs. Coaches for women's programs are paid less than coaches for men's programs. This has frequently been rationalized by the fact that women's programs are not as financially successful, do not generate similar media coverage and do not draw similar crowds as their male counterparts.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2010 NCAA Division I basketball, the median salary for the head coach position in women's programs was $171,600 and the median salary for the head coach position for men was $329,000.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 2018, the median salary for women's programs was increased to $690,000 and for men's programs to $2.7 million.<ref name=\":4\" /> The gap between men's and women's NCAA Division 1 programs was particularly significant among the highest paid coaches. As of 2018, [[Mike Krzyzewski]] at [[Duke University]] is the highest earning coach for men's basketball. He earned $9.0 million and had won 5 National Championships at that point.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/sports/ncaabasketball/pay-for-womens-basketball-coaches-lags-far-behind-mens-coaches.html|title=Pay for Women's Basketball Coaches Lags Far Behind Men's Coaches|last=Gentry|first=James K.|date=2012-04-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-03|last2=Alexander|first2=Raquel Meyer|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Pat Summitt]] at the [[University of Tennessee]] was the highest earning coach for the women's sport at $2.2 million with 8 National Championships.<ref name=\":5\" /> This overall pay disparity among male and female athletic programs exists across every sport and varies based on revenue and media coverage.\n\n=== Coverage ===\nWomen's sports are, on average, underrepresented in comparison to male sports.
