The game was directed by [[Hideki Kamiya]] and produced by [[Atsushi Inaba]]; the pair also worked together on the ''[[Viewtiful Joe (series)|Viewtiful Joe]]'' series and ''[[\u014ckami]]''. It was released in August 2013 in all major regions except North America, where it released the following month. ''The Wonderful 101'' received generally positive reviews, but failed to meet sales expectations.\n\nIn February 2020, PlatinumGames announced a remastered version for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]], financed through [[crowdfunding]], with a planned release in May 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:The Wonderful 101 Unite Morph battle screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of an earlier version of the game depicting a \"Unite Morph\" ability used to battle an opponent. The heroes have combined to form \"Unite Hand\", which is shown punching a large enemy called the Diedough-Goo.]]\n\nIn ''The Wonderful 101'', players control a horde of superheroes from an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] viewpoint and can turn them into various objects called \"Unite Morphs.\" As levels progress, players must explore each stage to find helpless citizens and recruit them to join their army of heroes. The more heroes gathered, the greater the special morph powers can be. At the cost of depleting their battery meter, players can use \"Unite Morph\" forms to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, or traverse the environment. The meter can be recharged by performing normal attacks or by picking up batteries dropped by a defeated enemy. Enemies will also drop \"O parts\" (the in-game currency used to buy upgrades), new \"Unite Morph\" abilities and items. To transform the horde of heroes, the appropriate symbol is drawn on the [[Wii U GamePad]]'s touchscreen or right [[analog stick]], such as an \u201cL\u201d for a gun or a squiggly line for a whip. In specified areas, the GamePad (by default) is used to change the view to a traditional, third-person angle and better explore tighter environments, such as those found indoors and inside caves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e3.nintendo.com/games/#/wiiu/projectp-100 |title=Nintendo All-Access @ E3 2012 - Games |website=E3.nintendo.com |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920061728/http://e3.nintendo.com/games/#/wiiu/projectp-100 |archivedate=September 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"nintendolife2\">{{cite web |last=Meyer |first=Lee |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/06/hands_on_the_wonderful_101/ |title=Hands On: The Wonderful 101 |work=Nintendo Life |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920093231/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/06/hands_on_the_wonderful_101 |archive-date=September 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U/The-Wonderful-101-641216.html |title=The Wonderful 101 |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe single-player campaign is broken into levels. Each level ends with a grade depending on a number of factors, such as how long it takes the player to complete the level and how much damage was taken by the player. In addition to a single-player mode, the game has a cooperative mode that supports up to five players, with one person utilizing the [[Wii U GamePad]] and the four others each using their own [[Wii U Pro Controller]]s.<ref name=\"nintendolife2\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e3.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-wonderful-101/ |title=The Wonderful 101 : Nintendo @ E3 2013 |website=E3.nintendo.com |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614185211/http://e3.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-wonderful-101/ |archivedate=June 14, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe game takes place during a third war between Earth and an alien terrorist organization called the Geathjerk Federation that has invaded the planet. The only hope for humanity is the Wonderful Ones, a group of superheroes working for the CENTINELS Planetary Secret Service, an organization created by the United Nations.\n\n===Characters===\nThe main protagonists are Will Wedgewood (Wonder-Red), a Blossom City elementary school teacher and the leader of the Wonderful Ones, whose father Arthur is killed by Laambo; Eliot Hooker (Wonder-Blue), a police detective whose older brother is killed by Vijounne; guns expert Jean-Sebastain Renault (Wonder-Green); fashion modeler Mariana Kretzulesco (Wonder-Pink); Russian soldier Ivan Istochinkov (Wonder-Yellow); ninja-in-training Momoe Byakkoin (Wonder-White); and video game player Krishna Ramanujan (Wonder-Black).\n\nThe supporting characters are P-Star, a robot who assists the heroes; Laurence Nelson (Wonder-Captain), the commander of the CENTINELS who was previously known as Wonder-Red; Virgin Victory operator Alice MacGregor; and science chief James Shirogane. Luka Alan Smithee is a Blossom City Elementary School student whose scientist mother, Margarita, died working for the CENTINELS and gave her life so that the artificial intelligence, Mother Platinum, could sustain the Earth's defensive shield. Luka joins the group and becomes Wonder-Goggles at the end of the game. The last member of the Galactic Police Federation is Immorta; her brother, Prince Vorkken, lived at the Roaming Comet Rhullo, but was brainwashed by Gimme, an alien who plants a virus in the form of a bio-weapon insect named Vaaiki on Vorkken's body. Vorkken becomes the space pirate leader of the Guyzoch and sides with Chewgi. The main villain is Jergingha, the supreme overlord of the Geathjerk Federation, who is attempting to use Chi-Q to take back the galaxy from humanity.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story opens with a school bus full of children being attacked by alien invaders known as the Geathjerk. The teacher, Mr. Wedgewood, transforms into the superhero Wonder-Red and teams up with the other superheroes to destroy the aliens with Unite Morph powers. One student, however, Luka, appears disillusioned and expresses his hate for both the heroes and the aliens.\n\nThe heroes then meet on their flagship to plan their defences. The Earth is protected from invasion by a shield, powered by five Super Reactors. The heroes must travel around the world to protect these reactors and destroy the aliens who slip through the shield. As they travel, they meet up with Professor Shirogane, who explains that once the reactors are safe, they will use an orbiting cannon, the Shirogane Comet, to destroy the remainder of the aliens. Along the way, Wonder-Red struggles to lead his team, particularly Wonder-Blue, whose brother was killed by one of the alien leaders, Vijounne. Blue's desire for revenge causes several problems until Red convinces him to cooperate with the team. Also, Luka stows away on the ship and the heroes are forced to bring him along to keep him safe.\n\nThe heroes also repeatedly fight the space pirate Prince Vorkken and his first mate Chewgi. Vorkken is searching for the strongest fighters in the galaxy so that he can have the strength to get revenge on the Geathjerk. Vorkken fights with Unite Morph attacks similar to those of the heroes and serves as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Wonder-Red in their encounters. With the help of Vorkken's sister, Immorta, the heroes defeat him, and Wonder-Red convinces Vorkken that his desire for revenge has turned him evil.\n\nAt the climax of the story, Luka betrays the heroes and joins the aliens, revealing that his pendant is the key that controls the Super Reactors. Luka explains that his mother died working on the shield that protects the Earth and he wants the aliens to destroy the Earth to get revenge for the loss of his mother. Wonder-Red however, announces that Luka's mother is still alive: she turned herself into Mother Platinum, the computer system that controls Earth's defences. Luka abandons his desire for revenge and Mother Platinum gathers pieces of the destroyed city to create a giant robot named \"Platinum Robo\". Using the robot, the heroes fight their way to the Shirogane Comet and fire its cannon, destroying the invading fleet. Jergingha, leader of the aliens, does not give up and returns in a gigantic fortress with an even bigger fleet. Platinum Robo flies to attack the fortress, while Chewgi and Vorkken arrive to help break through its defences. Upon being confronted, Jerrgingha reveals the Geathjerk are actually from 1,500 years in the future where Earth becomes an evil empire called the Greater Galactic Coelition, which has destroyed the homeworlds of the Geathjerk leaders. Geathjerk has come back in time to destroy Earth to prevent the Coelition from ever existing. Jergingha's fortress turns into a giant robot, even bigger than Platinum Robo, but the Wonderful Ones, Immorta, and Vorkken all combine their power and destroy it, saving the world. The Guyzoch leave with Vorkken to help rebuild the worlds they attacked. The Wonderful Ones vow to make sure Earth never becomes an Evil Empire like Jergingah seemingly predicted. Luka joins the Wonderful 100 to help make up for his mistakes. As a result, the team is renamed to the \"Wonderful 101\".\n\nThe epilogue shows Luka (now \"Wonder-Goggles\") and the other heroes saving a school bus from the aliens, paralleling the game's opening.  The story ends with the heroes continuing their fight against the remaining Geathjerk.\n\n==Development==\nThe development of what would become ''The Wonderful 101'' began during the lifetime of the [[Wii]]. The original idea came from PlatinumGames' president, Tatsuya Minami, who wanted to bring a group of popular or iconic video game characters together in one game. Because different gamers would prefer certain characters over others, the idea of being forced to play as a certain character at various points in the game was quickly scrapped. Instead, all of the characters would be on-screen at once so the player could choose between them at any time. PlatinumGames initially thought of using Nintendo first-party characters, who would work together to get past obstacles, but when the idea was presented to Nintendo, they questioned how the mechanic would fill an entire game. Director [[Hideki Kamiya]] also doubted that the \"conflicting elements\" of the different Nintendo characters could be successfully \"put into a consistent formula\" like in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. Further brainstorming was put on hold while he worked on another game, but when progress on that game was halted a year later, work on ''The Wonderful 101'' resumed. Kamiya decided to use the Japanese ''henshin'' / transforming theme, with a group of five original heroes who could unite and transform into various weapons. Soon the group expanded to one hundred heroes and the Japanese superhero style changed to \"an American comic book vibe\".\n\nThe game's design document was released by Platinum after stretch goals in the Kickstarter campaign for the remaster were met.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wonderful Wednesday #1: The Pitch Document |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/platinumgames/the-wonderful-101-remastered/posts/2747969 |website=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |language=en |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Alistair |title=Hideki Kamiya Reveals The Wonderful 101 Design Document |url=https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-reveals-the-wonderful-101-design-document/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the developers had been thinking of making the game for the Wii, when PlatinumGames and Nintendo finalized their partnership, it became Wii U-exclusive. The developers wanted to use the console's unique features effectively, so they came up with drawing on the GamePad as a way to activate the \"Unite Morphs\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/wonderful-101-and-a-world-without-genres |title=Wonderful 101 and a World Without Genres |author=Parish, Jeremy |date=September 9, 2013 |website=US Gamer |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909185557/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/wonderful-101-and-a-world-without-genres |archive-date=September 9, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/wiiu/the_wonderful_101/features/article/hideki_kamiya_interview_wonderful_101_the_bayonetta_2_controversy_his_twitter_account_and_more.html |title=Hideki Kamiya Interview: Wonderful 101, the Bayonetta 2 Controversy, His Twitter Account and More... |date=August 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060526/https://www.videogamer.com/wiiu/the_wonderful_101/features/article/hideki_kamiya_interview_wonderful_101_the_bayonetta_2_controversy_his_twitter_account_and_more.html |website=VideoGamer.com |publisher=Pro-G Media |accessdate=September 12, 2013  |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2020}}\nThe music in this game is an orchestrated score, written by Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Akira Takizawa, Hitomi Kurokawa, [[Norihiko Hibino]], Masato Kouda, and Rei Kondoh.

On July 3, 2013, Nintendo introduced their \"Wonderful Wednesday\" social networking campaign to promote ''The Wonderful 101'', where on each Wednesday leading up to the game's launch, they release a new character portrait. Two days later, however, Kamiya posted on [[Twitter]] that he was worried about the lack of marketing for ''The Wonderful 101''. He was referring to the lack of information in magazines or websites, and claimed that the game took almost 1.5 times the resources and manpower as Platinum's biggest game, ''[[Bayonetta]]''.

Nintendo only wanted to publish a new game if it was going to be exclusive to Nintendo Switch, while Platinum wanted the remaster to be on more platforms. Nintendo allowed them to do it, though they wouldn't publish the remaster. This gave Platinum the opportunity to try self-publishing. With the game nearly in a complete state for these new ports, they opted to use Kickstarter not only to judge how popular the game was, and thus mitigate the Kickstarter's stretch goals based on this, but also that there was still a necessary business element to self-publishing that the Kickstarter funds would help cover and deal with risks involved with publishing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Andy |title=Interview: Platinum explains why it\u2019s crowdfunding The Wonderful 101 Remastered |url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |website=[[Video Games Chronicle]] |accessdate=February 3, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203210210/https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |archivedate=February 3, 2020 |date=February 3, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Studio executive director Atsushi Inaba affirmed the Kickstarter was not about money for development but as a means to bring the community together and to make sure what additional content they could bring to the base game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Haydn |title=PlatinumGames: The Wonderful 101 Kickstarter wasn't about the money |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-03-02-platinum-games-the-wonderful-101-kickstarter-wasnt-about-the-money |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |language=en |date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> Among other cosmetic updates, Platinum had devised a way to take the two-screen approach that had been used on the Wii U version (including the picture-in-picture) into a version that will work on the single-screen platforms.

The game was directed by [[Hideki Kamiya]] and produced by [[Atsushi Inaba]]; the pair also worked together on the ''[[Viewtiful Joe (series)|Viewtiful Joe]]'' series and ''[[\u014ckami]]''. It was released in August 2013 in all major regions except North America, where it released the following month. ''The Wonderful 101'' received generally positive reviews, but failed to meet sales expectations.\n\nIn February 2020, PlatinumGames announced a remastered version for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]], financed through [[crowdfunding]], with a planned release in May 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:The Wonderful 101 Unite Morph battle screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of an earlier version of the game depicting a \"Unite Morph\" ability used to battle an opponent. The heroes have combined to form \"Unite Hand\", which is shown punching a large enemy called the Diedough-Goo.]]\n\nIn ''The Wonderful 101'', players control a horde of superheroes from an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] viewpoint and can turn them into various objects called \"Unite Morphs.\" As levels progress, players must explore each stage to find helpless citizens and recruit them to join their army of heroes. The more heroes gathered, the greater the special morph powers can be. At the cost of depleting their battery meter, players can use \"Unite Morph\" forms to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, or traverse the environment. The meter can be recharged by performing normal attacks or by picking up batteries dropped by a defeated enemy. Enemies will also drop \"O parts\" (the in-game currency used to buy upgrades), new \"Unite Morph\" abilities and items. To transform the horde of heroes, the appropriate symbol is drawn on the [[Wii U GamePad]]'s touchscreen or right [[analog stick]], such as an \u201cL\u201d for a gun or a squiggly line for a whip. In specified areas, the GamePad (by default) is used to change the view to a traditional, third-person angle and better explore tighter environments, such as those found indoors and inside caves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e3.nintendo.com/games/#/wiiu/projectp-100 |title=Nintendo All-Access @ E3 2012 - Games |website=E3.nintendo.com |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920061728/http://e3.nintendo.com/games/#/wiiu/projectp-100 |archivedate=September 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"nintendolife2\">{{cite web |last=Meyer |first=Lee |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/06/hands_on_the_wonderful_101/ |title=Hands On: The Wonderful 101 |work=Nintendo Life |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920093231/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/06/hands_on_the_wonderful_101 |archive-date=September 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U/The-Wonderful-101-641216.html |title=The Wonderful 101 |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe single-player campaign is broken into levels. Each level ends with a grade depending on a number of factors, such as how long it takes the player to complete the level and how much damage was taken by the player.

The only hope for humanity is the Wonderful Ones, a group of superheroes working for the CENTINELS Planetary Secret Service, an organization created by the United Nations.\n\n===Characters===\nThe main protagonists are Will Wedgewood (Wonder-Red), a Blossom City elementary school teacher and the leader of the Wonderful Ones, whose father Arthur is killed by Laambo; Eliot Hooker (Wonder-Blue), a police detective whose older brother is killed by Vijounne; guns expert Jean-Sebastain Renault (Wonder-Green); fashion modeler Mariana Kretzulesco (Wonder-Pink); Russian soldier Ivan Istochinkov (Wonder-Yellow); ninja-in-training Momoe Byakkoin (Wonder-White); and video game player Krishna Ramanujan (Wonder-Black).\n\nThe supporting characters are P-Star, a robot who assists the heroes; Laurence Nelson (Wonder-Captain), the commander of the CENTINELS who was previously known as Wonder-Red; Virgin Victory operator Alice MacGregor; and science chief James Shirogane. Luka Alan Smithee is a Blossom City Elementary School student whose scientist mother, Margarita, died working for the CENTINELS and gave her life so that the artificial intelligence, Mother Platinum, could sustain the Earth's defensive shield. Luka joins the group and becomes Wonder-Goggles at the end of the game. The last member of the Galactic Police Federation is Immorta; her brother, Prince Vorkken, lived at the Roaming Comet Rhullo, but was brainwashed by Gimme, an alien who plants a virus in the form of a bio-weapon insect named Vaaiki on Vorkken's body. Vorkken becomes the space pirate leader of the Guyzoch and sides with Chewgi. The main villain is Jergingha, the supreme overlord of the Geathjerk Federation, who is attempting to use Chi-Q to take back the galaxy from humanity.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story opens with a school bus full of children being attacked by alien invaders known as the Geathjerk. The teacher, Mr. Wedgewood, transforms into the superhero Wonder-Red and teams up with the other superheroes to destroy the aliens with Unite Morph powers. One student, however, Luka, appears disillusioned and expresses his hate for both the heroes and the aliens.\n\nThe heroes then meet on their flagship to plan their defences. The Earth is protected from invasion by a shield, powered by five Super Reactors. The heroes must travel around the world to protect these reactors and destroy the aliens who slip through the shield. As they travel, they meet up with Professor Shirogane, who explains that once the reactors are safe, they will use an orbiting cannon, the Shirogane Comet, to destroy the remainder of the aliens. Along the way, Wonder-Red struggles to lead his team, particularly Wonder-Blue, whose brother was killed by one of the alien leaders, Vijounne. Blue's desire for revenge causes several problems until Red convinces him to cooperate with the team. Also, Luka stows away on the ship and the heroes are forced to bring him along to keep him safe.\n\nThe heroes also repeatedly fight the space pirate Prince Vorkken and his first mate Chewgi. Vorkken is searching for the strongest fighters in the galaxy so that he can have the strength to get revenge on the Geathjerk. Vorkken fights with Unite Morph attacks similar to those of the heroes and serves as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Wonder-Red in their encounters. With the help of Vorkken's sister, Immorta, the heroes defeat him, and Wonder-Red convinces Vorkken that his desire for revenge has turned him evil.\n\nAt the climax of the story, Luka betrays the heroes and joins the aliens, revealing that his pendant is the key that controls the Super Reactors. Luka explains that his mother died working on the shield that protects the Earth and he wants the aliens to destroy the Earth to get revenge for the loss of his mother. Wonder-Red however, announces that Luka's mother is still alive: she turned herself into Mother Platinum, the computer system that controls Earth's defences. Luka abandons his desire for revenge and Mother Platinum gathers pieces of the destroyed city to create a giant robot named \"Platinum Robo\". Using the robot, the heroes fight their way to the Shirogane Comet and fire its cannon, destroying the invading fleet. Jergingha, leader of the aliens, does not give up and returns in a gigantic fortress with an even bigger fleet. Platinum Robo flies to attack the fortress, while Chewgi and Vorkken arrive to help break through its defences. Upon being confronted, Jerrgingha reveals the Geathjerk are actually from 1,500 years in the future where Earth becomes an evil empire called the Greater Galactic Coelition, which has destroyed the homeworlds of the Geathjerk leaders. Geathjerk has come back in time to destroy Earth to prevent the Coelition from ever existing. Jergingha's fortress turns into a giant robot, even bigger than Platinum Robo, but the Wonderful Ones, Immorta, and Vorkken all combine their power and destroy it, saving the world. The Guyzoch leave with Vorkken to help rebuild the worlds they attacked. The Wonderful Ones vow to make sure Earth never becomes an Evil Empire like Jergingah seemingly predicted. Luka joins the Wonderful 100 to help make up for his mistakes. As a result, the team is renamed to the \"Wonderful 101\".\n\nThe epilogue shows Luka (now \"Wonder-Goggles\") and the other heroes saving a school bus from the aliens, paralleling the game's opening.  The story ends with the heroes continuing their fight against the remaining Geathjerk.\n\n==Development==\nThe development of what would become ''The Wonderful 101'' began during the lifetime of the [[Wii]]. The original idea came from PlatinumGames' president, Tatsuya Minami, who wanted to bring a group of popular or iconic video game characters together in one game. Because different gamers would prefer certain characters over others, the idea of being forced to play as a certain character at various points in the game was quickly scrapped. Instead, all of the characters would be on-screen at once so the player could choose between them at any time. PlatinumGames initially thought of using Nintendo first-party characters, who would work together to get past obstacles, but when the idea was presented to Nintendo, they questioned how the mechanic would fill an entire game. Director [[Hideki Kamiya]] also doubted that the \"conflicting elements\" of the different Nintendo characters could be successfully \"put into a consistent formula\" like in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. Further brainstorming was put on hold while he worked on another game, but when progress on that game was halted a year later, work on ''The Wonderful 101'' resumed.

Nintendo only wanted to publish a new game if it was going to be exclusive to Nintendo Switch, while Platinum wanted the remaster to be on more platforms. Nintendo allowed them to do it, though they wouldn't publish the remaster. This gave Platinum the opportunity to try self-publishing. With the game nearly in a complete state for these new ports, they opted to use Kickstarter not only to judge how popular the game was, and thus mitigate the Kickstarter's stretch goals based on this, but also that there was still a necessary business element to self-publishing that the Kickstarter funds would help cover and deal with risks involved with publishing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Andy |title=Interview: Platinum explains why it\u2019s crowdfunding The Wonderful 101 Remastered |url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |website=[[Video Games Chronicle]] |accessdate=February 3, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203210210/https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |archivedate=February 3, 2020 |date=February 3, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Studio executive director Atsushi Inaba affirmed the Kickstarter was not about money for development but as a means to bring the community together and to make sure what additional content they could bring to the base game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Haydn |title=PlatinumGames: The Wonderful 101 Kickstarter wasn't about the money |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-03-02-platinum-games-the-wonderful-101-kickstarter-wasnt-about-the-money |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |language=en |date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> Among other cosmetic updates, Platinum had devised a way to take the two-screen approach that had been used on the Wii U version (including the picture-in-picture) into a version that will work on the single-screen platforms.
