The history of the newspaper can be best understood when divided into the eras of these individuals.\n\n===1901\u20131926: Marcellus E. Foster era===\nThe ''Houston Chronicle'' was founded in 1901 by a former reporter for the now-defunct ''[[Houston Post]]'', Marcellus E. Foster.  Foster, who had been covering the [[Spindletop]] oil boom for the ''Post'', invested in Spindletop and took $30 of the return on that investment \u2014 at the time equivalent to a week's wages \u2014 and used it to fund the ''Chronicle''.\n\nThe ''Chronicle's'' first edition was published on October 14, 1901 and sold for two cents per copy, at a time when most papers sold for five cents each. At the end of its first month in operation, the ''Chronicle'' had a circulation of 4,378 \u2014 roughly one tenth of the population of Houston at the time.<ref name=\"tsha\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eeh02 The Handbook of Texas Online.] ''Houston Chronicle''. Retrieved December 2, 2009.</ref> Within the first year of operation, the paper purchased and consolidated the ''Daily Herald''.\n\nIn 1908, Foster asked Jesse H. Jones, a local businessman and prominent builder, to construct a new office and plant for the paper, \"and offered [a] half-interest in the newspaper as a down payment, with twenty years to pay the remainder.  Jones agreed, and the resulting Chronicle Building was one of the finest in the South.\"<ref name=\"tsha\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Jesse H.

Foster continued to write columns under the pen name Mefo, and drew much attention in the 1920s for his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He sold the rest of his interest to [[Jesse H. Jones]] on June 26, 1926 and promptly retired.<ref>Handbook of Texas Online. \"[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffo52 Foster, Marcellus Elliot (1870\u20131942)\"].

It has grown into a citywide program that provides needy children between the ages of two and ten with toys during the [[Christmas and holiday season|winter holidays]].  In 2003, Goodfellows distributed almost 250,000 toys to more than 100,000 needy children in the [[Greater Houston]] area.\n\n===1926\u20131956: Jesse H. Jones era===\nIn 1926, [[Jesse H. Jones]] became the sole owner of the paper.  He had approached Foster about selling, and Foster had answered, \"What will you give me?\". Jones described the buyout of Foster as follows:\n{{Quote|text=Wanting to be liberal with Foster if I bought him out, since he had created the paper and originally owned most of the stock, and had made a success of it, I thought for a while before answering and finally asked him how much he owed.  He replied, 'On real estate and everything about 200,000 dollars.'  I then said to him that I would give him 300,000 dollars in cash, having in mind that this would pay his debts and give him 100,000 spending money.  In addition, I would give him a note for 500,000 secured by a mortgage on the Chronicle Building, the note to be payable (interest and principal) at the rate of 35,000 a year for thirty-five years, which I figured was about his expectancy.  I would also pay him 20,000 dollars a year as editor of the paper and 6,000 dollars a year to continue writing the daily front-page column, 'MEFO,' on the condition that either of us could cancel the editorship and/or the MEFO-column contracts on six months notice, and that, if I canceled both the column and the editorship, I would give him an additional 6,000 dollars a year for life.  I considered the offer substantially more than the ''Chronicle'' was worth at the time.  No sooner had I finished stating my proposition than he said, 'I will take it,' and the transaction was completed accordingly.|sign=|source=p.&nbsp;121\u2013122 of ''Jesse H. Jones: The Man and the Statesman'' by [[Bascom N. Timmons]], copyright 1956 Henry Holt and Company}}\n\nIn 1937, Jesse H. Jones transferred ownership of the paper to the newly established [[Houston Endowment Inc.]] Jones retained the title of publisher until his death in 1956.\n\nAccording to [[The Handbook of Texas]] Online, the ''Chronicle'' generally represented very conservative political views during the 1950s:\n::\"...the ''Chronicle'' generally represented the very conservative political interests of the Houston business establishment. As such, it eschewed controversial political topics, such as integration or the impacts of rapid economic growth on life in the city. It did not perform investigative journalism. This resulted in a stodgy newspaper that failed to capture the interests of newcomers to the city. By 1959, circulation of the rival ''Houston Post'' had pulled ahead of the ''Chronicle''.\"<ref name=\"tsha\"/>\n\nJones, a lifelong Democrat who organized the Democratic National Convention to be in Houston in 1928, and who spent long years in public service first under the Wilson administration, helping to found the Red Cross during World War I, and later famously under the Roosevelt administration, described the paper's mission in these terms:\n\n::\"I regard the publication of a newspaper as a distinct public trust, and one not to be treated lightly or abused for selfish purposes or to gratify selfish whims.  A great daily newspaper can remain a power for good only so long as it is uninfluenced by unworthy motives, and unbought by the desire for gain.  A newspaper which can be neither bought nor bullied is the greatest asset of a city or state.  Naturally, a newspaper makes mistakes in judgment, as it does in type; but, so long as errors are honestly made, they are not serious when general results are considered.\n\n::The success or failure of a particular issue is of little consequence compared with the all-important principle of a fearless and honest newspaper.  This I intend the ''Chronicle'' shall always be, a newspaper for all the people, democratic in fact and in principle, standing for the greatest good to the greatest number, championing and defending what it believes to be right, and condemning and opposing what it believes to be wrong.\n\n::Such have always been the policies of the ''Chronicle'' and to such it is now rededicated.\"<ref>Jesse H. Jones: \"The Man and the Statesman\", page 122 \u2013 123</ref>\n\nUnder Jones' watch, the ''Chronicle'' bought [[KTRH]], one of Houston's oldest radio stations, in 1937.  In 1954, Jones led a syndicate that signed on Houston's third television station, [[KTRK-TV]].\n\n===1956\u20131965: John T. Jones era===\nThe board of Houston Endowment named John T. Jones, nephew of Jesse H. Jones, as editor of the ''Chronicle''. Houston Endowment president, J. Howard Creekmore, was named publisher.\nIn 1961, John T. Jones hired [[William P. Steven]] as editor. Steven had previously been editor of the ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'', and credited with turning around the declining readership of both papers. One of his innovations was the creation of a regular help column called \"Watchem,\" where ordinary citizens could voice their complaints. The ''Chicago Tribune'' later called this column a pioneer and prototype of the modern newspaper \"Action Line.\"<ref name = \"ChiTrib\">Heise, Kenan. \"W.P.

Johnson, the Democratic candidate for president.  But more than political philosophy was involved:  Robert A. Caro revealed in his biography of Johnson that written assurance of this support from John T. Jones had been the price demanded by Johnson in January 1964 in return for approval of the merger of Houston's National Bank of Commerce, in which Jones had a financial interest, with another Houston bank, the Texas National.{{sfn|Caro|2012|pages=523\u2013527}}\n\nIn 1964, the ''Chronicle'' purchased the assets of its evening newspaper competitor, the ''Houston Press'',<ref name=\"tsha\"/> becoming the only evening newspaper in the city. By then, the ''Chronicle'' had a circulation of 254,000 \u2013 the largest of any paper in Texas. The ''Atlantic Monthly'' credited the growth to the changes instigated by Steven.<ref name = \"Atlantic\">Bagdikian, Ben H.

Retrieved March 25, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1965, Jones decided to buy a local television station that was already owned by the Houston Endowment. He resigned from the Houston Endowment board to avoid a conflict of interest, though he remained as publisher of the ''Chronicle''. On September 2, 1965, Jones made a late-night visit to the Steven home, where he broke the news that the Endowment board had ordered him to dismiss Steven. Jones had to comply. On September 3, the paper published a story announcing that Everett Collier was now the new editor.<ref name = \"Atlantic\" />\n\nNo mention was made of Steven or the Houston Endowment board.  ''Houston Post'' staff wrote an article about the change, but top management killed it. Only two weekly papers in Houston mentioned it: ''Forward Times'' (which targeted the African-American community) and the ''Houston Tribune'' (an ultra conservative paper). Both papers had rather small circulations and no influence among the city's business community.<ref name = \"Atlantic\" /> The two major newspapers in Houston never mentioned Steven for many years thereafter.\n\n===1965\u20131987: J. Howard Creekmore era===\nJohn J. Jones left the ''Chronicle'' not long after Steven's ouster. J. Howard Creekmore, president of the Houston Endowment, took John Jones' place at the ''Chronicle''. Everett D. Collier replaced Steven as editor. Collier remained in this position until his retirement in 1979.\n\nJ. Howard Creekmore was born in Abilene, Texas in 1905. His parents died while he was young, so he was raised by his stepmother. The family moved to Houston in 1920. Howard enrolled in Rice Institute, where he graduated with degrees in history and English. After graduation, he went to work for Jesse Jones as a bookkeeper. Jones took an interest in the young man's career, and put him through law school. Creekmore passed the bar exam in 1932 and returned to work for Jones. He held several positions in the Jones business empire. In 1959, he was named to the board of Houston Endowment, and was promoted to president of the board in 1964.<ref>\nAckerman, Todd.

Houston oilman John Mecom offered $85 million for the newspaper, its building, a 30 percent interest in Texas National Bank of Commerce and the historic Rice Hotel. Early in 1966, Mecom encountered problems raising the additional cash to complete the transaction. He then began lining up potential buyers for the newspaper, which included non-Houstonians such as Sam Newhouse, Otis Chandler and the Scripps-Howard organization. Creekmore strongly believed that local persons should own the paper. He insisted that Mecom pay the $84 million debt immediately in cash. Mecom cancelled his purchase agreement.<ref>''Time''. \u201cNewspapers: A Deal Done In\u201d June 17, 1966.

The history of the newspaper can be best understood when divided into the eras of these individuals.\n\n===1901\u20131926: Marcellus E. Foster era===\nThe ''Houston Chronicle'' was founded in 1901 by a former reporter for the now-defunct ''[[Houston Post]]'', Marcellus E. Foster.  Foster, who had been covering the [[Spindletop]] oil boom for the ''Post'', invested in Spindletop and took $30 of the return on that investment \u2014 at the time equivalent to a week's wages \u2014 and used it to fund the ''Chronicle''.\n\nThe ''Chronicle's'' first edition was published on October 14, 1901 and sold for two cents per copy, at a time when most papers sold for five cents each. At the end of its first month in operation, the ''Chronicle'' had a circulation of 4,378 \u2014 roughly one tenth of the population of Houston at the time.<ref name=\"tsha\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eeh02 The Handbook of Texas Online.] ''Houston Chronicle''. Retrieved December 2, 2009.</ref> Within the first year of operation, the paper purchased and consolidated the ''Daily Herald''.\n\nIn 1908, Foster asked Jesse H. Jones, a local businessman and prominent builder, to construct a new office and plant for the paper, \"and offered [a] half-interest in the newspaper as a down payment, with twenty years to pay the remainder.  Jones agreed, and the resulting Chronicle Building was one of the finest in the South.\"<ref name=\"tsha\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Jesse H.

Foster continued to write columns under the pen name Mefo, and drew much attention in the 1920s for his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He sold the rest of his interest to [[Jesse H. Jones]] on June 26, 1926 and promptly retired.<ref>Handbook of Texas Online. \"[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffo52 Foster, Marcellus Elliot (1870\u20131942)\"].

Jones]] became the sole owner of the paper.  He had approached Foster about selling, and Foster had answered, \"What will you give me?\". Jones described the buyout of Foster as follows:\n{{Quote|text=Wanting to be liberal with Foster if I bought him out, since he had created the paper and originally owned most of the stock, and had made a success of it, I thought for a while before answering and finally asked him how much he owed.  He replied, 'On real estate and everything about 200,000 dollars.'  I then said to him that I would give him 300,000 dollars in cash, having in mind that this would pay his debts and give him 100,000 spending money.  In addition, I would give him a note for 500,000 secured by a mortgage on the Chronicle Building, the note to be payable (interest and principal) at the rate of 35,000 a year for thirty-five years, which I figured was about his expectancy.  I would also pay him 20,000 dollars a year as editor of the paper and 6,000 dollars a year to continue writing the daily front-page column, 'MEFO,' on the condition that either of us could cancel the editorship and/or the MEFO-column contracts on six months notice, and that, if I canceled both the column and the editorship, I would give him an additional 6,000 dollars a year for life.  I considered the offer substantially more than the ''Chronicle'' was worth at the time.  No sooner had I finished stating my proposition than he said, 'I will take it,' and the transaction was completed accordingly.|sign=|source=p.&nbsp;121\u2013122 of ''Jesse H. Jones: The Man and the Statesman'' by [[Bascom N. Timmons]], copyright 1956 Henry Holt and Company}}\n\nIn 1937, Jesse H. Jones transferred ownership of the paper to the newly established [[Houston Endowment Inc.]] Jones retained the title of publisher until his death in 1956.\n\nAccording to [[The Handbook of Texas]] Online, the ''Chronicle'' generally represented very conservative political views during the 1950s:\n::\"...the ''Chronicle'' generally represented the very conservative political interests of the Houston business establishment. As such, it eschewed controversial political topics, such as integration or the impacts of rapid economic growth on life in the city. It did not perform investigative journalism. This resulted in a stodgy newspaper that failed to capture the interests of newcomers to the city. By 1959, circulation of the rival ''Houston Post'' had pulled ahead of the ''Chronicle''.\"<ref name=\"tsha\"/>\n\nJones, a lifelong Democrat who organized the Democratic National Convention to be in Houston in 1928, and who spent long years in public service first under the Wilson administration, helping to found the Red Cross during World War I, and later famously under the Roosevelt administration, described the paper's mission in these terms:\n\n::\"I regard the publication of a newspaper as a distinct public trust, and one not to be treated lightly or abused for selfish purposes or to gratify selfish whims.  A great daily newspaper can remain a power for good only so long as it is uninfluenced by unworthy motives, and unbought by the desire for gain.  A newspaper which can be neither bought nor bullied is the greatest asset of a city or state.  Naturally, a newspaper makes mistakes in judgment, as it does in type; but, so long as errors are honestly made, they are not serious when general results are considered.\n\n::The success or failure of a particular issue is of little consequence compared with the all-important principle of a fearless and honest newspaper.  This I intend the ''Chronicle'' shall always be, a newspaper for all the people, democratic in fact and in principle, standing for the greatest good to the greatest number, championing and defending what it believes to be right, and condemning and opposing what it believes to be wrong.\n\n::Such have always been the policies of the ''Chronicle'' and to such it is now rededicated.\"<ref>Jesse H. Jones: \"The Man and the Statesman\", page 122 \u2013 123</ref>\n\nUnder Jones' watch, the ''Chronicle'' bought [[KTRH]], one of Houston's oldest radio stations, in 1937.  In 1954, Jones led a syndicate that signed on Houston's third television station, [[KTRK-TV]].\n\n===1956\u20131965: John T. Jones era===\nThe board of Houston Endowment named John T. Jones, nephew of Jesse H. Jones, as editor of the ''Chronicle''. Houston Endowment president, J. Howard Creekmore, was named publisher.\nIn 1961, John T. Jones hired [[William P. Steven]] as editor. Steven had previously been editor of the ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'', and credited with turning around the declining readership of both papers. One of his innovations was the creation of a regular help column called \"Watchem,\" where ordinary citizens could voice their complaints. The ''Chicago Tribune'' later called this column a pioneer and prototype of the modern newspaper \"Action Line.\"<ref name = \"ChiTrib\">Heise, Kenan. \"W.P.

Johnson, the Democratic candidate for president.  But more than political philosophy was involved:  Robert A. Caro revealed in his biography of Johnson that written assurance of this support from John T. Jones had been the price demanded by Johnson in January 1964 in return for approval of the merger of Houston's National Bank of Commerce, in which Jones had a financial interest, with another Houston bank, the Texas National.{{sfn|Caro|2012|pages=523\u2013527}}\n\nIn 1964, the ''Chronicle'' purchased the assets of its evening newspaper competitor, the ''Houston Press'',<ref name=\"tsha\"/> becoming the only evening newspaper in the city. By then, the ''Chronicle'' had a circulation of 254,000 \u2013 the largest of any paper in Texas. The ''Atlantic Monthly'' credited the growth to the changes instigated by Steven.<ref name = \"Atlantic\">Bagdikian, Ben H.

Retrieved March 25, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1965, Jones decided to buy a local television station that was already owned by the Houston Endowment. He resigned from the Houston Endowment board to avoid a conflict of interest, though he remained as publisher of the ''Chronicle''. On September 2, 1965, Jones made a late-night visit to the Steven home, where he broke the news that the Endowment board had ordered him to dismiss Steven. Jones had to comply. On September 3, the paper published a story announcing that Everett Collier was now the new editor.<ref name = \"Atlantic\" />\n\nNo mention was made of Steven or the Houston Endowment board.  ''Houston Post'' staff wrote an article about the change, but top management killed it. Only two weekly papers in Houston mentioned it: ''Forward Times'' (which targeted the African-American community) and the ''Houston Tribune'' (an ultra conservative paper). Both papers had rather small circulations and no influence among the city's business community.<ref name = \"Atlantic\" /> The two major newspapers in Houston never mentioned Steven for many years thereafter.\n\n===1965\u20131987: J. Howard Creekmore era===\nJohn J. Jones left the ''Chronicle'' not long after Steven's ouster. J. Howard Creekmore, president of the Houston Endowment, took John Jones' place at the ''Chronicle''. Everett D. Collier replaced Steven as editor. Collier remained in this position until his retirement in 1979.\n\nJ. Howard Creekmore was born in Abilene, Texas in 1905. His parents died while he was young, so he was raised by his stepmother. The family moved to Houston in 1920. Howard enrolled in Rice Institute, where he graduated with degrees in history and English. After graduation, he went to work for Jesse Jones as a bookkeeper. Jones took an interest in the young man's career, and put him through law school. Creekmore passed the bar exam in 1932 and returned to work for Jones. He held several positions in the Jones business empire. In 1959, he was named to the board of Houston Endowment, and was promoted to president of the board in 1964.<ref>\nAckerman, Todd.

Houston oilman John Mecom offered $85 million for the newspaper, its building, a 30 percent interest in Texas National Bank of Commerce and the historic Rice Hotel. Early in 1966, Mecom encountered problems raising the additional cash to complete the transaction. He then began lining up potential buyers for the newspaper, which included non-Houstonians such as Sam Newhouse, Otis Chandler and the Scripps-Howard organization. Creekmore strongly believed that local persons should own the paper. He insisted that Mecom pay the $84 million debt immediately in cash. Mecom cancelled his purchase agreement.<ref>''Time''. \u201cNewspapers: A Deal Done In\u201d June 17, 1966.

The opinion piece resulted in hundreds of angry letters to the editor and reportedly over 4,000 angry responses to Jensen.<ref>Jensen, Robert. \"[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/editorial/outlook/1215826 Four months later, no regrets for writing against U.S. policy].\" ''Houston Chronicle''.

Retrieved January 8, 2012.</ref>\n\nAmong them were claims of insensitivity against the newspaper and of giving an unduly large audience to a position characterized as being extremist. University of Texas president [[Larry Faulkner]] issued a response denouncing Jenson's as \"a fountain of undiluted foolishness on issues of public policy\", noting \"[h]e is not speaking in the University's name and may not speak in its name.\"<ref>[http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/RHE306fall01/RhetAnaly/analyzethis.htm CWRL.texas.edu]</ref>\n\n==Other publications==\nIn April 2004 the ''Houston Chronicle'' began carrying a Spanish-language supplement, the entertainment magazine ''[[La Vibra]]''. ''La Vibra'' caters to speakers of Spanish and bilingual English-Spanish speakers, and is mainly distributed in Hispanic neighborhoods. In December 2004 the ''Chronicle'' acquired the Spanish-language newspaper ''[[La Voz de Houston]]''.<ref name=\"MorenoLaVoz\"/>\n\n==Criticism==\n===Light rail controversy===\nThe document was online for only an hour, but long enough to be viewed by some readers. Soon after, the ''Houston Review'', a conservative newspaper published by students at the [[University of Houston]], printed the memo's full text and an accompanying commentary that criticized the paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstonreview.com/1102/chroniclememo.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021204203757/http://www.houstonreview.com/1102/chroniclememo.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 4, 2002|title=The Houston Review|date=December 4, 2002}}</ref><ref>Connelly, Richard. \"[http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-09-11/news/trainspotting/ Trainspotting].\" ''[[Houston Press]]''.

Rosenthal's involvement in the probe itself came under fire by the ''[[Houston Press]]'', which in editorials questioned whether Rosenthal was too close to TTM: from 2000 to 2004, Rosenthal accepted some $30,000 in donations from known TTM supporters.<ref>Ties That Bind?

After the article appeared, Sandoval's stepfather and sister called into Houston talk radio station [[KSEV]] and said that a sentence alleging \"President Bush's failure to find weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq misrepresented their views on the war and President [[George W. Bush]], that Wall had pressured them for a quotation that criticized Bush, and that the line alleging Bush's \"failure\" was included against the wishes of the family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publiustx.net/|title=PubliusTX.net|website=www.publiustx.net}}</ref>\n\nA dispute ensued between KSEV radio show host/owner [[Dan Patrick (Texas politician)|Dan Patrick]] and an assistant managing editor at the ''Chronicle''.

Eventually, ''Chronicle'' publisher Jack Sweeney contacted the Sandoval family to apologize.<ref name=\"Abclocal.go.com\"/>\n\n===Purchase of ''Houston Post'' assets===\nInternal memos obtained via FOIA from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] [[antitrust]] attorneys who investigated the closing of the ''Houston Post'' said the ''Chronicle's'' parent organization struck a deal to buy the ''Post'' six months before it closed. The memos, first obtained by the alternative paper the ''Houston Press'', say the ''Chronicle's'' conglomerate and the ''Post'' \"reached an agreement in October, 1994, for the sale of Houston Post Co.'s assets for approximately $120 million.\"<ref>[http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/print.php?story=04/05/31/6064236 Reclaimthemedia.org]</ref>\n\n===Tom DeLay poll===\nIn January 2006 the ''Chronicle'' hired Richard Murray of the [[University of Houston]] to conduct an election survey in the district of U.S. Rep. [[Tom DeLay]], in light of his 2005 indictment by District Attorney [[Ronnie Earle]] for alleged campaign money violations. The ''Chronicle'' said that its poll showed \"severely eroded support for U.S. Rep Tom DeLay in his district, most notably among Republicans who have voted for him before.\"<ref>Mack, Kristen. \"[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3587652.html Troubles erode support for DeLay in 22nd District].\" ''Houston Chronicle''.

Rains also asserted that Murray had a conflict of interest in the poll, as Murray's son Keir was a political consultant working for [[Nick Lampson]], DeLay's Democratic challenger in 2006.<ref>[http://lonestartimes.com/2006/01/19/hendee-emails-murray-re-chron-delay-poll/ Lonestartimes.com]</ref>\n\n==Availability of ''Houston Post'' articles==\nSome ''[[Houston Post]]'' articles had been made available in the archives of the ''Houston Chronicle'' website, but by 2005 they were removed. The ''Houston Chronicle'' online editor Mike Read said that the ''Houston Chronicle'' decided to remove ''Houston Post'' articles from the website after the 2001 [[United States Supreme Court]] ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' decision; the newspaper originally planned to filter articles not allowed by the decision and to post articles that were not prohibited by the decision. The ''Houston Chronicle'' decided not to post or re-post any more ''Houston Post'' articles because of difficulties in complying with the ''New York Times Co. v. Tasini'' decision with the resources that were available to the newspaper.<ref name=\"blogs.chron.com\">Newkirk, Jim.
