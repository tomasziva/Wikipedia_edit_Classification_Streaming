Garza is credited with inspiring the slogan when, after the July 2013 acquittal of [[George Zimmerman]] of murder in the death of [[Trayvon Martin]], she posted on [[Facebook]]: \"Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter, Black Lives Matter\" which Cullors then shared with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter.

The Movement for Black Lives is the largest group inside the Black Lives Matter movement\u2019s network. This group directs their [[activism]] based on Garza\u2019s [[advocacy]] style which works outside of the existing power structure. They reject traditional tactics and avoid making connections and compromises with politicians.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWithin the group, the power structure is different than most. They wanted to avoid the power structure they felt failed other black activist groups. The group puts those with the most marginalized identities in [[leadership]] positions. The group also created the Policy Table in 2015 in an attempt to translate their goals into a policy platform. This involved initiatives that give bail money to black mothers who could not afford it and a land-rights initiative.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Additional work==\nPreviously, Garza had served as the director of People Organized to Win Employment Rights (POWER) in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. During her time in the position, she won the right for youth to use public transportation for free in San Francisco and also fought [[gentrification]] and exposing police brutality in the area.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pleasant|first1=Liz|title=Meet the Woman Behind #BlackLives Matter \u2013 The Hashtag that Became a Civil Rights Movement|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/make-it-right/meet-the-woman-behind-black-lives-matter-the-hashtag-that-became-a-civil-rights-movement|website=Yes Magazine|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref> Garza is an active participant in several Bay Area social movement groups.

Garza is credited with inspiring the slogan when, after the July 2013 acquittal of [[George Zimmerman]] of murder in the death of [[Trayvon Martin]], she posted on [[Facebook]]: \"Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter, Black Lives Matter\" which Cullors then shared with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter.

The Movement for Black Lives is the largest group inside the Black Lives Matter movement\u2019s network. This group directs their [[activism]] based on Garza\u2019s [[advocacy]] style which works outside of the existing power structure. They reject traditional tactics and avoid making connections and compromises with politicians.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWithin the group, the power structure is different than most. They wanted to avoid the power structure they felt failed other black activist groups. The group puts those with the most marginalized identities in [[leadership]] positions. The group also created the Policy Table in 2015 in an attempt to translate their goals into a policy platform. This involved initiatives that give bail money to black mothers who could not afford it and a land-rights initiative.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Additional work==\nPreviously, Garza had served as the director of People Organized to Win Employment Rights (POWER) in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. During her time in the position, she won the right for youth to use public transportation for free in San Francisco and also fought [[gentrification]] and exposing police brutality in the area.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pleasant|first1=Liz|title=Meet the Woman Behind #BlackLives Matter \u2013 The Hashtag that Became a Civil Rights Movement|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/make-it-right/meet-the-woman-behind-black-lives-matter-the-hashtag-that-became-a-civil-rights-movement|website=Yes Magazine|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref> Garza is an active participant in several Bay Area social movement groups.
