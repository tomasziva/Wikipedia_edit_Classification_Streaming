Trans women may experience [[gender dysphoria]] and may transition; this process commonly includes [[Transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] and sometimes [[sex reassignment surgery]], which can bring relief and resolve feelings of gender dysphoria. Trans women may be [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[asexuality|asexual]], or identify with other terms (such as [[queer]]).\n\nThe term ''[[transgender]] woman'' is not always interchangeable with ''[[transsexual]] woman'', although the terms are often used interchangeably. ''Transgender'' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes different types of [[gender variant]] people (including transsexual people). Trans women face significant discrimination in many areas of life ([[transmisogyny]], a subset of [[transphobia]]), including in employment and access to housing, and face physical and sexual violence and hate crimes, including from partners; in the United States, discrimination is particularly severe towards trans women who are members of a [[racial minority]], who often face the intersection of transphobia and [[racism]].\n\nTrans women, simply, are not women.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{See also|Transsexual}}\n[[File:Transwoman at Gay Pride in S\u00e3o Paulo, 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A trans woman at a gay pride parade in [[S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]]]\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may experience [[gender dysphoria]], distress brought upon by the discrepancy between their gender identity and the sex that was assigned to them at birth (and the associated gender role or primary and secondary sex characteristics).<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (version 7) |publisher=The World Professional Association for Transgender Health |page=96 |url=http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care,%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924061804/http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care%2C%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may transition. A major component of medical transition for trans women is [[estrogen]] [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]], which causes the development of female [[secondary sex characteristic]]s ([[breast]]s, redistribution of body fat, lower [[waist\u2013hip ratio]], etc.).

In contrast, Levitt explains that \"transsexual people have a sexual identity that does not match their physical sex\" and that some desire sex-reassignment surgery.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn addition, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' refers to transsexual as \"having physical characteristics of one sex and psychological characteristics of the other\" and \"one whose sex has been changed by surgery.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> These definitions show that someone who is transsexual expresses their gender differently than assigned at birth. In addition, they may want or undergo surgery to change their physical appearance. Thus trans women fall under the umbrella of being transgender because their gender was assigned male at birth but they identify as a woman.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, not all trans women are transsexual since they may or may not choose to undergo sex-reassignment surgery.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nSome trans women who feel that their [[gender]] transition is complete prefer to be called simply ''women,'' considering ''trans woman'' or ''male-to-female transsexual'' to be terms that should only be used for people who are not fully transitioned. Likewise, many may not want to be seen as a \"trans woman,\" often owing to the societal otherization of trans individuals. Among those who do refer to themselves as trans women, many see it as an important and appropriate distinction to include a space in the term, as in ''trans woman'', thus using ''trans'' as merely an adjective describing a particular type of woman; this is in contrast to the usage of ''transwoman'' as one word, implying a \"[[third gender]]\".<ref>{{Cite book | last=Serano | first=Julia |

''Transgender'' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes different types of [[gender variant]] people (including transsexual people). Trans women face significant discrimination in many areas of life ([[transmisogyny]], a subset of [[transphobia]]), including in employment and access to housing, and face physical and sexual violence and hate crimes, including from partners; in the United States, discrimination is particularly severe towards trans women who are members of a [[racial minority]], who often face the intersection of transphobia and [[racism]].\n\nTrans women, simply, are not women.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{See also|Transsexual}}\n[[File:Transwoman at Gay Pride in S\u00e3o Paulo, 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A trans woman at a gay pride parade in [[S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]]]\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may experience [[gender dysphoria]], distress brought upon by the discrepancy between their gender identity and the sex that was assigned to them at birth (and the associated gender role or primary and secondary sex characteristics).<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (version 7) |publisher=The World Professional Association for Transgender Health |page=96 |url=http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care,%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924061804/http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care%2C%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may transition.

In contrast, Levitt explains that \"transsexual people have a sexual identity that does not match their physical sex\" and that some desire sex-reassignment surgery.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn addition, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' refers to transsexual as \"having physical characteristics of one sex and psychological characteristics of the other\" and \"one whose sex has been changed by surgery.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> These definitions show that someone who is transsexual expresses their gender differently than assigned at birth.

Likewise, many may not want to be seen as a \"trans woman,\" often owing to the societal otherization of trans individuals. Among those who do refer to themselves as trans women, many see it as an important and appropriate distinction to include a space in the term, as in ''trans woman'', thus using ''trans'' as merely an
