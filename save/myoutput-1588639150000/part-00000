Loose medium systems have their soil packed into a shelf or bag and are then installed onto the wall.  These systems require their media to be replaced at least once a year on exteriors and approximately every two years on interiors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  Loose soil systems are not well suited for areas with any seismic activity.  Most importantly, because these systems can easily have their medium blown away by wind-driven rain or heavy winds, these should not be used in applications over 8 feet high.  There are some systems in Asia that have solved the loose media erosion problem by use of shielding systems to hold the media within the green wall system even when soil liquefaction occurs under seismic load.  In these systems, the plants can still up-root themselves in the liquified soil under seismic load, and therefore it is required that the plants be secured to the system to prevent them from falling from the wall.  Loose-soil systems without physical media erosion systems are best suited for the home gardener where occasional replanting is desired from season to season or year to year.  Loose-soil systems with physical media erosion systems are well suited for all green wall applications.\n\n===Mat media===\nMat type systems tend to be either coir fiber or felt mats. Mat media are quite thin, even in multiple layers, and as such cannot support vibrant root systems of mature plants for more than three to five years before the roots overtake the mat and water is not able to adequately wick through the mats. The method of reparation of these systems is to replace large sections of the system at a time by cutting the mat out of the wall and replacing it with new mat. This process compromises the root structures of the neighboring plants on the wall and often kills many surrounding plants in the reparation process. These systems are best used on the interior of a building and are a good choice in areas with low seismic activity and small plants that will not grow to a weight that could rip the mat apart under their own weight over time.  It is important to note that mat systems are particularly water inefficient and often require constant irrigation due to the thin nature of the medium and its inability to hold water and provide a buffer for the plant roots. This inefficiency often requires that these systems have a water re-circulation system put into place at an additional cost. Mat media are better suited for small installations no more than eight feet in height where repairs are easily completed.\n\n=== Sheet media ===\nSemi-open cell polyurethane sheet media utilising an egg crate pattern has successfully been used in recent years for both outdoor roof gardens and vertical walls. The water holding capacity of these engineered polyurethanes vastly exceeds that of coir and felt based systems. Polyurethanes do not biodegrade, and hence stay viable as an active substrate for 20+ years. Vertical wall systems utilising polyurethane sheeting typically employ a sandwich construction where a water proof membrane is applied to the back, the polyurethane sheeting (typically two sheets with irrigation lines in between) is laid and then a mesh or anchor braces/bars secure the assembly to the wall. Pockets are cut into the face of the first urethane sheet into which plants are inserted. Soil is typically removed from the roots of any plants prior to insertion into the urethane mattress substrate. A flaked or chopped noodle version of the same polyurethane material can also be added to existing structural media mixes to boost water retention.\n\n===Structural media===\n{{multiple image\n|direction=vertical\n|align=left\n|width=220\n|image1=Green wall, Sutton town centre (geograph 3014022).jpg\n|image2=Wilkinsons grass covered store Sutton surrey 26-01-12..jpg\n|caption2=The Green Wall in [[Sutton High Street]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], Greater London\n}}\nStructural media are growth medium \"blocks\" that are not loose, nor mats, but which incorporate the best features of both into a block that can be manufactured into various sizes, shapes and thicknesses.  These media have the advantage that they do not break down for 10 to 15 years, can be made to have a higher or lower water holding capacity depending on the plant selection for the wall, can have their pH and EC's customized to suit the plants, and are easily handled for maintenance and replacement.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThere is also some discussion involving \"active\" living walls.  An active living wall actively pulls or forces air through the plants le quality to the point that the installation of other air quality filtration systems can be removed to provide a cost-savings.  Therefore, the added cost of design, planning and implementation of an active living wall is still in question.  With further research and UL standards to support the air quality data from the living wall, building code may one day allow for our buildings to have their air filtered by plants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.purdue.edu/inhome/#house|title=Purdue Solar Decathlon|website=www.purdue.edu|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018150129/http://www.purdue.edu/inhome/#house|archive-date=2017-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe area of air quality and plants is continuing to be researched.

The plants may purify slightly polluted water (such as [[greywater]]) by absorbing the dissolved nutrients. Bacteria mineralize the organic components to make them available to the plants. A study is underway at the Bertschi School in Seattle, Washington, using a GSky Pro Wall system, however, no publicly available data on this is available at this time.\n\nLiving walls are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. They are also suitable in arid areas, as the circulating water on a vertical wall is less likely to evaporate than in horizontal gardens.\n\nThe living wall could also function for [[urban agriculture]], [[urban horticulture|urban gardening]], or for its beauty as [[art]]. It is sometimes built indoors to help alleviate [[sick building syndrome]].\n[[File:Green wall - Longwood Gardens - DSC01042.JPG|thumb|A green wall in [[Longwood Gardens]] in [[Pennsylvania]].]]\nLiving walls are also acknowledged for remediation of poor air quality, both to internal and external areas. \n\nGreen walls provide an additional layer of insulation that can protect buildings from heavy rainwater which leads to management of heavy storm water and provides thermal mass. They also help reduce the temperature of a building because vegetation absorbs large amounts of solar radiation. This can reduce energy demands and cleanse the air from [[Volatile organic compound|VOC\u2019s (Volatile Organic Compounds)]] released by paints, furniture, and adhesives. Off-gassing from VOCs can cause headaches, eye irritation, and airway irritation and internal air pollution. Green walls can also purify the air from mould growth in building interiors that can cause asthma and allergies. Vegetation in green walls can help with the mitigation of the [[Urban heat island|heat island effect]] and contribute to urban [[biodiversity]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=K.

To have the best result on all of the aforementioned, some green wall systems has special and patented technologies that is developed to the benefit of the plants.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://en.naturalgreenwalls.com/ | title=Living green walls from Natural Greenwalls for offices and professionals}}</ref>\n\nAnother example in urban areas is green walls provide acoustic protection and reduces the noise through sound absorption.\n\nThomas Pugh, a biogeochemist at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany]], created a computer model of a green wall with a broad selection of vegetation. The study showed results of the green wall absorbing nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. In street canyons where polluted air is trapped, green walls can absorb the polluted air and purify the streets.\n\n== Green Facade vs Living Wall ==\n[[File:Scaffold-modular-green-wall.jpg|thumb|Scaffold modular green wall]]\nGreen facades are plants that climb or are hanging along the walls from growing plants at the base or an installed container. Plants can grow upward or downward. There are two classifications to green facades: direct and indirect. Direct green facades are attached to the wall while indirect green facades incorporates a structure that will support it for plants. Indirect green facades include two different solutions: continuous and modular. \u00a0Modular and continuous systems secure the living wall and further protect so it can hold itself from the changing weather.\n\nLiving walls have a uniform way of growing plants. There is more technology and installation involved. The solutions of continuous and modular also apply to living walls where continuous living walls are based on one support system that guides vegetation through the whole surface. They have permeable screens where each plant is individually put in and in the application is lightweight. Modular green facades have vessels for rooting plants and come in forms such as trays, vessels, planter tiles, or flexible bags\n\n== Plants ==\n[[File:Green-Wall-Blusson-Hall-SFU-Burnaby-British-Columbia-Canada-01-A.jpg|thumb|Green wall the Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.]]\nPlants need to be close together in order to look good. The right plants need to be chosen for the right places because the ones with disease can contaminate others surrounding it. In order to have a wall growing all year round, 95 percent of the plants need to be evergreen. Perennials are best for seasonal green walls. It is necessary to choose plants that can withstand disease since replacement is costly. There are specific plants best suited in different environments. Different plants for shade, sun, windy, and a combination will need to be considered for longer a lifespan. The lifespan of plants will need to be considered when assessing long term green walls. Regular maintenance, the right places, and the right plants are needed to sustain a living wall. Pruning dead plants and weeds will keep the wall healthy and gaps need to be filled.\n\n=== Herbs ===\nBasil, Bay, Caraway, Chamomile, Chives, Coriander, Curry plant, Dill, Lavender, Lemon balm, Lemongrass, Marjoram, Mint, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sage, Sorrel Tarragon, Thyme.\n\n=== Edible plants ===\nChard, Cherry tomatoes, Dwarf cabbages, English spinach, Lettuces, Radishes, Rocket, Silverbeet, Small Chillies, Strawberries, [[Watercress]]...etc.\n\n=== Plants for sun ===\n[[Achillea]], Acorus, Armeria maritima, [[Bergenia]], Bidens, Calamintha nepeta, Carex, Convolvulus cneorum, Erica, Geranium, Lavender, Liriope, Pansy, Rosemary, Sedum, Solidago, Thyme, Westringia...etc.\n\n=== Plants for shade ===\nAdiantum, Asplenium, Begonia, [[Bergenia]], Chlorophytum comosum, Erica, Euphorbia, Heuchera, Polystichum, Snowdrop...etc.\n\n== Sources ==\n* Clapp, L., & Klotz, H.

Loose medium systems have their soil packed into a shelf or bag and are then installed onto the wall.  These systems require their media to be replaced at least once a year on exteriors and approximately every two years on interiors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  Loose soil systems are not well suited for areas with any seismic activity.  Most importantly, because these systems can easily have their medium blown away by wind-driven rain or heavy winds, these should not be used in applications over 8 feet high.  There are some systems in Asia that have solved the loose media erosion problem by use of shielding systems to hold the media within the green wall system even when soil liquefaction occurs under seismic load.  In these systems, the plants can still up-root themselves in the liquified soil under seismic load, and therefore it is required that the plants be secured to the system to prevent them from falling from the wall.  Loose-soil systems without physical media erosion systems are best suited for the home gardener where occasional replanting is desired from season to season or year to year.  Loose-soil systems with physical media erosion systems are well suited for all green wall applications.\n\n===Mat media===\nMat type systems tend to be either coir fiber or felt mats. Mat media are quite thin, even in multiple layers, and as such cannot support vibrant root systems of mature plants for more than three to five years before the roots overtake the mat and water is not able to adequately wick through the mats. The method of reparation of these systems is to replace large sections of the system at a time by cutting the mat out of the wall and replacing it with new mat. This process compromises the root structures of the neighboring plants on the wall and often kills many surrounding plants in the reparation process. These systems are best used on the interior of a building and are a good choice in areas with low seismic activity and small plants that will not grow to a weight that could rip the mat apart under their own weight over time.  It is important to note that mat systems are particularly water inefficient and often require constant irrigation due to the thin nature of the medium and its inability to hold water and provide a buffer for the plant roots. This inefficiency often requires that these systems have a water re-circulation system put into place at an additional cost. Mat media are better suited for small installations no more than eight feet in height where repairs are easily completed.\n\n=== Sheet media ===\nSemi-open cell polyurethane sheet media utilising an egg crate pattern has successfully been used in recent years for both outdoor roof gardens and vertical walls. The water holding capacity of these engineered polyurethanes vastly exceeds that of coir and felt based systems. Polyurethanes do not biodegrade, and hence stay viable as an active substrate for 20+ years. Vertical wall systems utilising polyurethane sheeting typically employ a sandwich construction where a water proof membrane is applied to the back, the polyurethane sheeting (typically two sheets with irrigation lines in between) is laid and then a mesh or anchor braces/bars secure the assembly to the wall. Pockets are cut into the face of the first urethane sheet into which plants are inserted. Soil is typically removed from the roots of any plants prior to insertion into the urethane mattress substrate. A flaked or chopped noodle version of the same polyurethane material can also be added to existing structural media mixes to boost water retention.\n\n===Structural media===\n{{multiple image\n|direction=vertical\n|align=left\n|width=220\n|image1=Green wall, Sutton town centre (geograph 3014022).jpg\n|image2=Wilkinsons grass covered store Sutton surrey 26-01-12..jpg\n|caption2=The Green Wall in [[Sutton High Street]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], Greater London\n}}\nStructural media are growth medium \"blocks\" that are not loose, nor mats, but which incorporate the best features of both into a block that can be manufactured into various sizes, shapes and thicknesses.  These media have the advantage that they do not break down for 10 to 15 years, can be made to have a higher or lower water holding capacity depending on the plant selection for the wall, can have their pH and EC's customized to suit the plants, and are easily handled for maintenance and replacement.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThere is also some discussion involving \"active\" living walls.  An active living wall actively pulls or forces air through the plants le quality to the point that the installation of other air quality filtration systems can be removed to provide a cost-savings.  Therefore, the added cost of design, planning and implementation of an active living wall is still in question.  With further research and UL standards to support the air quality data from the living wall, building code may one day allow for our buildings to have their air filtered by plants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.purdue.edu/inhome/#house|title=Purdue Solar Decathlon|website=www.purdue.edu|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018150129/http://www.purdue.edu/inhome/#house|archive-date=2017-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe area of air quality and plants is continuing to be researched.

The plants may purify slightly polluted water (such as [[greywater]]) by absorbing the dissolved nutrients. Bacteria mineralize the organic components to make them available to the plants. A study is underway at the Bertschi School in Seattle, Washington, using a GSky Pro Wall system, however, no publicly available data on this is available at this time.\n\nLiving walls are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. They are also suitable in arid areas, as the circulating water on a vertical wall is less likely to evaporate than in horizontal gardens.\n\nThe living wall could also function for [[urban agriculture]], [[urban horticulture|urban gardening]], or for its beauty as [[art]]. It is sometimes built indoors to help alleviate [[sick building syndrome]].\n[[File:Green wall - Longwood Gardens - DSC01042.JPG|thumb|A green wall in [[Longwood Gardens]] in [[Pennsylvania]].]]\nLiving walls are also acknowledged for remediation of poor air quality, both to internal and external areas. \n\nGreen walls provide an additional layer of insulation that can protect buildings from heavy rainwater which leads to management of heavy storm water and provides thermal mass. They also help reduce the temperature of a building because vegetation absorbs large amounts of solar radiation. This can reduce energy demands and cleanse the air from [[Volatile organic compound|VOC\u2019s (Volatile Organic Compounds)]] released by paints, furniture, and adhesives. Off-gassing from VOCs can cause headaches, eye irritation, and airway irritation and internal air pollution. Green walls can also purify the air from mould growth in building interiors that can cause asthma and allergies. Vegetation in green walls can help with the mitigation of the [[Urban heat island|heat island effect]] and contribute to urban [[biodiversity]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=K.

To have the best result on all of the aforementioned, some green wall systems has special and patented technologies that is developed to the benefit of the plants.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://en.naturalgreenwalls.com/ | title=Living green walls from Natural Greenwalls for offices and professionals}}</ref>\n\nAnother example in urban areas is green walls provide acoustic protection and reduces the noise through sound absorption.\n\nThomas Pugh, a biogeochemist at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany]], created a computer model of a green wall with a broad selection of vegetation. The study showed results of the green wall absorbing nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. In street canyons where polluted air is trapped, green walls can absorb the polluted air and purify the streets.\n\n== Green Facade vs Living Wall ==\n[[File:Scaffold-modular-green-wall.jpg|thumb|Scaffold modular green wall]]\nGreen facades are plants that climb or are hanging along the walls from growing plants at the base or an installed container. Plants can grow upward or downward. There are two classifications to green facades: direct and indirect. Direct green facades are attached to the wall while indirect green facades incorporates a structure that will support it for plants. Indirect green facades include two different solutions: continuous and modular. \u00a0Modular and continuous systems secure the living wall and further protect so it can hold itself from the changing weather.\n\nLiving walls have a uniform way of growing plants. There is more technology and installation involved. The solutions of continuous and modular also apply to living walls where continuous living walls are based on one support system that guides vegetation through the whole surface. They have permeable screens where each plant is individually put in and in the application is lightweight. Modular green facades have vessels for rooting plants and come in forms such as trays, vessels, planter tiles, or flexible bags\n\n== Plants ==\n[[File:Green-Wall-Blusson-Hall-SFU-Burnaby-British-Columbia-Canada-01-A.jpg|thumb|Green wall the Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.]]\nPlants need to be close together in order to look good. The right plants need to be chosen for the right places because the ones with disease can contaminate others surrounding it. In order to have a wall growing all year round, 95 percent of the plants need to be evergreen. Perennials are best for seasonal green walls. It is necessary to choose plants that can withstand disease since replacement is costly. There are specific plants best suited in different environments. Different plants for shade, sun, windy, and a combination will need to be considered for longer a lifespan. The lifespan of plants will need to be considered when assessing long term green walls. Regular maintenance, the right places, and the right plants are needed to sustain a living wall. Pruning dead plants and weeds will keep the wall healthy and gaps need to be filled.\n\n=== Herbs ===\nBasil, Bay, Caraway, Chamomile, Chives, Coriander, Curry plant, Dill, Lavender, Lemon balm, Lemongrass, Marjoram, Mint, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sage, Sorrel Tarragon, Thyme.\n\n=== Edible plants ===\nChard, Cherry tomatoes, Dwarf cabbages, English spinach, Lettuces, Radishes, Rocket, Silverbeet, Small Chillies, Strawberries, [[Watercress]]...etc.\n\n=== Plants for sun ===\n[[Achillea]], Acorus, Armeria maritima, [[Bergenia]], Bidens, Calamintha nepeta, Carex, Convolvulus cneorum, Erica, Geranium, Lavender, Liriope, Pansy, Rosemary, Sedum, Solidago, Thyme, Westringia...etc.\n\n=== Plants for shade ===\nAdiantum, Asplenium, Begonia, [[Bergenia]], Chlorophytum comosum, Erica, Euphorbia, Heuchera, Polystichum, Snowdrop...etc.\n\n== Sources ==\n* Clapp, L., & Klotz, H.
