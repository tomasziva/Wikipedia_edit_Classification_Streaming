Extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance.<ref name=\"Seattle, 2007\" /> They can be established on a very thin layer of soil (most use specially formulated composts): even a thin layer of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]] laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of ''[[Sedum]]'' species and [[moss]]es.  Some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements. To protect the roof, a waterproofing membrane is often used, which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness, ponding water, high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots, fungi and bacterial organisms.<ref name=\"Green (Planted) Roofs\">{{cite web |title=Green (Planted) roofs |publisher=The Vinyl Roofing Division of the Chemical Fabrics & Film Association |date=22 June 2012 |url=http://vinylroofs.org/resources/green-planted-roofs/index.html}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in green roof technology have led to the development of new systems that do not fit into the traditional classification of green roof types.

Pitched [[sod roof]]s, a traditional feature of many Scandinavian buildings, tend to be of a simpler design than flat green roofs.  This is because the pitch of the roof reduces the risk of water penetrating through the roof structure, allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Authentic Viking recreation.jpg|thumb|left|Re-creation of [[Viking]] houses in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]]]\n[[File:Heidal.jpg|thumb|left|Sod roofs on 18th-century farm buildings in [[Heidal]], Norway.]]In ancient times green roofs consisted of cave-like structures or [[sod roof]]s covered with earth and plants commonly used for agriculture, dwelling, and ceremonial purposes.

Berlin is one of the most important centers of green roof research in Germany. Particularly in the last 10 years, much more research has begun. About ten green roof research centers exist in the US and activities exist in about 40 countries. In a recent study on the impacts of green infrastructure, in particular green roofs in the Greater Manchester area, researchers found that adding green roofs can help keep temperatures down, particularly in urban areas: \"adding green roofs to all buildings can have a dramatic effect on maximum surface temperatures, keeping temperatures below the 1961\u20131990 current form case for all time periods and emissions scenarios.

The fish also get some nutrients from the roots of the plants.\n\n===Finland===\nIn Finland, green roofs are still scarce. Some experimental green roofs have been built in big cities. However, the capital city of Helsinki has published guidelines for enhancing the building of green roofs in the city.

In the 1970s, green roof technology was elevated to the next level. Serious storm-water issues made cities think about innovative solutions, preferably with living plants. Modern green roof technology with high performance, lightweight materials were utilized to grow hardy vegetation even on roofs that can hardly support any additional load. In the 1980s modern green roof technology was common knowledge in Germany while it was practically unknown in any other country in the world. In Stuttgart, with one of the most innovative Department of Parks and Recreation and with the world's oldest horticultural Universities, modern green roof technology was perfected and implemented on a large scale.\n\nWith the first green roof industry boom in Germany there were quality issues recorded. The FLL formed a committee that is focused on modern green roof technology. FLL stands for Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau e.V. (German Landscape Research, Development and Construction Society). The FLL is an independent non-profit organization. It was founded in 1975 by eight professional organizations for \"the improvement of environmental conditions through the advancement and dissemination of plant research and its planned applications\". The FLL green roof working group is only one of 40 committees which have published a long list of guidelines and labor instructions. Some of these guidelines also available in English including the German FLL-Guideline for the Planning, Execution and Upkeep of Green-Roof Sites. The results of the research and synthesis done by FLL members are constantly updated and promulgated utilizing the same principles which govern the compilation of DIN standards and are published as either guiding principles or labor instructions.\n\nThe current Green Roof Guideline was published in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenrooftechnology.com/_literature_98993/Introduction_to_the_German_FLL_-_Guideline_for_Green_Roofs_2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041742/http://www.greenrooftechnology.com/_literature_98993/Introduction_to_the_German_FLL_-_Guideline_for_Green_Roofs_2011 |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref>\nToday most elements of the German FLL are part of standards and guidelines around the world (FM Global, ASTM, NRCA, SPRI etc.).\n\nFachvereinigung Bauwerksbegr\u00fcnung (FBB) was founded in 1990 as the second green roof association after DDV (Deutscher Dachgaertner Verband) in 1985. FBB was founded as an open forum for manufacturers and planners, merchants and operators in 1990. The organization was born from the then-visionary idea of understanding the relationship between nature and constructions not as oppositional, but as an opportunity. Both the green roofing and conventional roofing industries are equally represented.\nThe FBB has developed to become an innovative lobbying group with a strong market presence, internationally known through its cooperation with other European associations. Today, approximately 100 member companies use the multifaceted services offered by FBB, which offers a greater degree of market expertise and competitiveness. \"Kompetenz im Markt\".\n\nToday, about {{convert|10000000|m2|sqft|abbr=in}} of new green roofs are being constructed each year. According latest studies about {{frac|3|4}} of these are extensive; the last {{frac|1|4}} are roof gardens. The cities with the most green roofs in Germany are Berlin and [[Stuttgart]].  Surveys about the status of regulation are done by the FBB.  Nearly one third of all German cities have regulations to support green-roof and rain-water technology.  Green-roof research institutions are located in several cities as including [[Hannover]], Berlin, [[Geisenheim]] and [[Neubrandenburg]].\n\nGermany is the country with the most green roofs in the world and it is the country with the most advanced knowledge in modern green roof technology.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Green roofs in Germany are part of the 2 \u20133 years apprentice educations system of landscaping professionals.\n\n===Greece===\n[[File:The Treasury - Syntagma.jpg|thumb|The ''oikostegi'', a green roof on the Treasury building in Athens]]\nThe Greek Ministry of Finance has now installed a green roof on the Treasury in Constitution Square in Athens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mnec.gr/el/press_office/DeltiaTypou/articles/article0933.html |title=\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u2013 \u039a\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 |publisher=Mnec.gr |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418212542/http://www.mnec.gr/el/press_office/DeltiaTypou/articles/article0933.html |archivedate=18 April 2009  }}</ref> The so-called \"oikostegi\" (Greek \u2013 ''oiko'', {{IPA-el|\u02c8iko|pron}}, meaning building-ecological, and ''stegi'', pronounced ''staygee'', meaning roof-abode-shelter) was inaugurated in September 2008.

Another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include [[Pest (organism)|pest]] insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through open windows.\n\nThe additional mass of the soil substrate and retained water places a large strain on the structural support of a building.

Some of the early examples include the Freshwater Place residential tower in Melbourne (2002) with its Level 10 rooftop Half Acre Garden, CH2 building housing the Melbourne City Council (2006) \u2013 Australia's first 6-star Green Star Design commercial office building as certified by the [[Green Building Council of Australia]], and Condor Tower (2005) with a {{convert|75|m2|sqft|adj=on|abbr=off}} lawn on the 4th floor.\n\nIn 2010, the largest Australian green roof project was announced.  The Victorian Desalination Project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquasure.com.au|title=Home|website=www.aquasure.com.au}}</ref> will have a \"living tapestry\" of 98,000 Australian indigenous plants over a roof area spanning more than {{convert|26000|m2|sqft|abbr=in}}.  The roof will form part of the desalination plant's sophisticated roof system, designed to blend the building into the landscape, and provide acoustic protection, corrosion resistance, thermal control, and reduced maintenance.  The green roof was designed by ASPECT Studios, ARM / pecvkvonhartel architecture, and will be installed by Fytogreen Australia.\n\nSince 2008, City Councils and influential business groups in Australia have become active promoting the benefits of green roofs.  \"The Blueprint to Green Roof Melbourne\" is one program being run by the Committee for Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.growingup.org.au/|title=Best Remodeling Ideas To Increase Your Home's Value -|website=Best Remodeling Ideas To Increase Your Home\u2019s Value}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014 ecological artist Lloyd Godman, with structural engineer Stuart Jones and environmental scientist Grant Harris in a ground breaking experiment installed [[Tillandsia]] plants at level 92, 91, 65 and 56 on Eureka Tower. The air plants, are extremely light, grow with no soil or watering system and have survived for more than 5 years. Over this time one plant, Tillandsia bergeri has grown from a single growing shoot to 13. The project is now titled Tillandsia SWARM and has been expanded to may other buildings in the city including Federation Square, National Gallery of Victoria, Essendon Airport. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/extreme-gardening-on-the-92nd-floor-of-the-eureka-tower-20150323-1m45sm.html|title=Extreme gardening on the 92nd floor of the Eureka Tower|first=Aisha|last=Dow|date=23 March 2015|newspaper=The Age}}</ref> They have also experimented with moving Tillandsia plant screens that can be moved across skylights to create shade in summer and up the roof to let sun in during winter.

Native plants, mostly flowers chosen for the environment, maximum shade and mass provide a colorful and functional living roof. The community has the largest number of green roofs in the country.\n\n===Egypt===\nIn [[Egypt]], soil-less agriculture is used to grow plants on the roofs of buildings.  No soil is placed directly on the roof itself, thus eliminating the need for an insulating layer; instead, plants are grown on wooden tables.  Vegetables and fruit are the most popular candidates, providing a fresh, healthy source of food that is free from pesticides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/745/en2.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &#124; Environment &#124; May your roof be green |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=8 June 2005 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703190639/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/745/en2.htm |archivedate=3 July 2012  }}</ref>\n\nA more advanced method, ([[aquaponics]]), being used experimentally in Egypt, is farming fish next to plants in a closed cycle.  This allows the plants to benefit from the ammonia excreted by the fish, helping the plants to grow better and at the same time eliminating the need for changing the water for the fish, because the plants help to keep it clean by absorbing the ammonia.  The fish also get some nutrients from the roots of the plants.\n\n===Finland===\nIn Finland, green roofs are still scarce. Some experimental green roofs have been built in big cities. However, the capital city of Helsinki has published guidelines for enhancing the building of green roofs in the city. There is on-going research on the topic as the conditions in the southern Europe are very different from those in the north and knowledge acquired there can't be directly applied to colder climates.

In the 1970s, green roof technology was elevated to the next level. Serious storm-water issues made cities think about innovative solutions, preferably with living plants. Modern green roof technology with high performance, lightweight materials were utilized to grow hardy vegetation even on roofs that can hardly support any additional load. In the 1980s modern green roof technology was common knowledge in Germany while it was practically unknown in any other country in the world. In Stuttgart, with one of the most innovative Department of Parks and Recreation and with the world's oldest horticultural Universities, modern green roof technology was perfected and implemented on a large scale.\n\nWith the first green roof industry boom in Germany there were quality issues recorded. The FLL formed a committee that is focused on modern green roof technology. FLL stands for Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau e.V. (German Landscape Research, Development and Construction Society). The FLL is an independent non-profit organization. It was founded in 1975 by eight professional organizations for \"the improvement of environmental conditions through the advancement and dissemination of plant research and its planned applications\". The FLL green roof working group is only one of 40 committees which have published a long list of guidelines and labor instructions. Some of these guidelines also available in English including the German FLL-Guideline for the Planning, Execution and Upkeep of Green-Roof Sites. The results of the research and synthesis done by FLL members are constantly updated and promulgated utilizing the same principles which govern the compilation of DIN standards and are published as either guiding principles or labor instructions.\n\nThe current Green Roof Guideline was published in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenrooftechnology.com/_literature_98993/Introduction_to_the_German_FLL_-_Guideline_for_Green_Roofs_2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041742/http://www.greenrooftechnology.com/_literature_98993/Introduction_to_the_German_FLL_-_Guideline_for_Green_Roofs_2011 |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref>\nToday most elements of the German FLL are part of standards and guidelines around the world (FM Global, ASTM, NRCA, SPRI etc.).\n\nFachvereinigung Bauwerksbegr\u00fcnung (FBB) was founded in 1990 as the second green roof association after DDV (Deutscher Dachgaertner Verband) in 1985. FBB was founded as an open forum for manufacturers and planners, merchants and operators in 1990. The organization was born from the then-visionary idea of understanding the relationship between nature and constructions not as oppositional, but as an opportunity. Both the green roofing and conventional roofing industries are equally represented.\nThe FBB has developed to become an innovative lobbying group with a strong market presence, internationally known through its cooperation with other European associations. Today, approximately 100 member companies use the multifaceted services offered by FBB, which offers a greater degree of market expertise and competitiveness. \"Kompetenz im Markt\".\n\nToday, about {{convert|10000000|m2|sqft|abbr=in}} of new green roofs are being constructed each year. According latest studies about {{frac|3|4}} of these are extensive; the last {{frac|1|4}} are roof gardens. The cities with the most green roofs in Germany are Berlin and [[Stuttgart]].  Surveys about the status of regulation are done by the FBB.  Nearly one third of all German cities have regulations to support green-roof and rain-water technology.  Green-roof research institutions are located in several cities as including [[Hannover]], Berlin, [[Geisenheim]] and [[Neubrandenburg]].\n\nGermany is the country with the most green roofs in the world and it is the country with the most advanced knowledge in modern green roof technology.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Green roofs in Germany are part of the 2 \u20133 years apprentice educations system of landscaping professionals.\n\n===Greece===\n[[File:The Treasury - Syntagma.jpg|thumb|The ''oikostegi'', a green roof on the Treasury building in Athens]]\nThe Greek Ministry of Finance has now installed a green roof on the Treasury in Constitution Square in Athens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mnec.gr/el/press_office/DeltiaTypou/articles/article0933.html |title=\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u2013 \u039a\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 |publisher=Mnec.gr |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418212542/http://www.mnec.gr/el/press_office/DeltiaTypou/articles/article0933.html |archivedate=18 April 2009  }}</ref> The so-called \"oikostegi\" (Greek \u2013 ''oiko'', {{IPA-el|\u02c8iko|pron}}, meaning building-ecological, and ''stegi'', pronounced ''staygee'', meaning roof-abode-shelter) was inaugurated in September 2008.

The plants used on the roof include ''[[Achillea tomentosa]]'' (woolly yarrow), ''[[Armeria maritima]]'' (sea pink, sea thrift), ''[[Carex inops]] pensylvanica'' (long-stoloned sedge), ''[[Eriophyllum lanatum]]'' (Oregon sunshine), ''[[Festuca rubra]]'' (red creeping fescue), ''[[Festuca idahoensis]]'' (Idaho fescue), ''[[Phlox subulata]]'' (creeping phlox), ''[[Saxifraga caespitosa]]'' (tufted saxifrage), ''[[Sedum oreganum]]'' (Oregon stonecrop), ''[[Sedum album]]'' (white stonecrop), ''[[Sedum spurium]]'' (two-row stonecrop), ''[[Sisyrinchium idahoense]]'' (blue-eyed grass), ''[[Thymus serpyllum]]'' (wild thyme), ''[[Triteleia hyacinthina]]'' (fool's onion).\n-->\n\nAn early green-roofed building (completed in 1971) is the {{convert|358000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Weyerhaeuser Corporate Headquarters building in Federal Way, Washington.  Its 5-story office roof system comprises a series of stepped terraces covered in greenery.  From the air, the building blends into the landscape.\n\nThe largest green roof in New York City was installed in midtown [[Manhattan]] atop the [[United States Postal Service]]'s Morgan Processing and Distribution Center.  Construction on the {{convert|109000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} project began in September 2008, and was finished and dedicated in July 2009.  Covered in native vegetation and having an expected lifetime of fifty years, this green roof will not only save the USPS approximately $30,000 a year in heating and cooling costs, but will also significantly reduce the amount of storm water contaminants entering the municipal water system.<ref>{{cite web |title = USPS News Release: U.S. Postal Service Opens First Green Roof |date = 22 July 2009 |url = http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2009/pr09_063.htm |accessdate = 11 February 2011 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101231222639/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2009/pr09_063.htm |archivedate = 31 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/greennews/pdf/greenkit_5.pdf | title=Green Roof: Morgan Processing and Distribution Center (P&DC) |accessdate=3 March 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801200244/http://www.capitolroofinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/greenkit-5.pdf |archivedate= 1 August 2014}}</ref>\n<!--\nAtop the [[Museum of Modern Art]] is a modern sculptural garden spanning over {{convert|16,750|sqft|m2}}. This rooftop is physically inaccessible to the public but has some of the most visible rooftop space in New York. [[Ken Smith (architect)|Ken Smith]] designed MoMA rooftop as a Landscape Architect by using 185 plastic rocks, 560 artificial boxwoods, {{convert|300|lb|kg}} of clear crushed glass, {{cvt|4|ST|t}} of recycled rubber mulch. His design was awarded the [[American Society of Landscape Architecture]] for design in 2009.\n-->\nIn 2001, atop [[Chicago City Hall]], the {{convert|38800|sqft|adj=on}} roof gardens were completed, serving as a pilot project to assess the impact green roofs would have on the [[heat island]] effect in urban areas, rainwater runoff, and the effectiveness of differing types of green roofs and plant species for Chicago's climate. Although the rooftop is not normally accessible to the public, it is visually accessible from 33 taller buildings in the area. The garden consists of 20,000 plants of more than 150 species, including shrubs, vines and two trees. The green roof design team was headed by the Chicago area firm Conservation Design Forum in conjunction with noted \"green\" architect [[William McDonough]]. With an abundance of flowering plants on the rooftop, beekeepers harvest approximately {{convert|200|lb|kg|-1}} of honey each year from hives installed on the rooftop. Tours of the green roof are by special arrangement only.

Extensive green roofs have low maintenance requirements but they are generally not maintenance free.  German research has quantified the need to remove unwanted seedlings to approximately 6 seconds/m<sup>2</sup>/year.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Deutscher Gartenbau|author=Kolb, W.|author2=Schwarz, T.|year=2002|title=Gepflegtes gr\u00fcn auf dem dach|language=de|issue=7|pages=32\u201334}}</ref> Maintenance of green roofs often includes fertilization to increase flowering and succulent plant cover.  If aesthetics are not an issue, fertilization and maintenance are generally not needed.  Extensive green roofs should only be fertilized with controlled-release fertilizers in order to avoid pollution of the storm water.  Conventional fertilizers should never be used on extensive vegetated roofs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Emilsson | first1 = T. | last2 = Czemiel Berndtsson | first2 = J. | last3 = Mattsson | first3 = J-E | last4 = Rolf | first4 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Effect of using conventional and controlled release fertilizer on nutrient runoff from various vegetated roof systems | journal = Ecological Engineering | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 260\u2013271 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2006.01.001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Czemiel Berndtsson | first1 = J. | last2 = Emilsson | first2 = T. | last3 = Bengtsson | first3 = L. | year = 2006 | title = The influence of extensive vegetated roofs on runoff water quality | journal = Science of the Total Environment | volume = 355 | issue = 1\u20133| pages = 48\u201363 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.02.035 | pmid = 16442432 }}</ref> German studies have approximated the nutrient requirement of vegetated roofs to 5&nbsp;gN/m<sup>2</sup>.
