Highlighted areas show marmot, bird, insect and aircraft noises.]]\n'''Soundscape ecology''' is the study of the acoustic relationships between living organisms, human and other, and their environment, whether the organisms are marine or terrestrial. First appearing in the ''Handbook for Acoustic Ecology'' edited by [[Barry Truax]], in 1978,<ref>Truax, Barry (1978). ''Handbook for Acoustic Ecology'', A. R. C Publications, Vancouver, BC.</ref> the term has occasionally been used, sometimes interchangeably, with the term [[acoustic ecology]]. Soundscape ecologists also study the relationships between the three basic sources of sound that comprise the soundscape: those generated by organisms are referred to as the [[biophony]]; those from non-biological natural categories are classified as the [[geophony]], and those produced by [[human]]s, the [[anthropophony]].\n\nIncreasingly, soundscapes are dominated by a sub-set of anthropophony (sometimes referred to in older, more archaic terminology as \"anthropogenic noise\"), or technophony, the overwhelming presence of electro-mechanical noise. This sub-class of [[noise pollution]] or disturbance may produce a negative effect on a wide range of organisms. Variations in [[soundscape]]s as a result of natural phenomena and human endeavor may have wide-ranging [[ecology|ecological]] effects as many organisms have evolved to respond to acoustic cues that emanate primarily from undisturbed habitats.\n\nSoundscape ecologists use [[digital recording|recording devices]], audio tools, and elements of traditional ecological and acoustic analyses to study soundscape structure. Soundscape ecology has deepened current understandings of ecological issues and established profound visceral connections to ecological data. The preservation of natural soundscapes is now a recognized [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] goal.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:River_Fluvi\u00e0_at_Olot_20060418_03.JPG|350px|thumb|Sounds produced by physical features of the environment such as running water contribute to natural soundscapes]]\nSoundscape ecology serves as a lens into other fields including medicine, music, dance, philosophy, environmental studies, etc. ([[soundscape|the soundscape]]).<ref>Krause, Bernie (August, 2015).

Non-biological in nature, it consists of the effect of wind in trees or grasses, water flowing in a stream, waves at an ocean or lake shoreline, and movement of the earth. [[Biophony]] is a term introduced by soundscape ecologist, [[Bernie Krause]], who in 1998, first began to express the soundscape in terms of its acoustic sources. The biophony refers to the collective acoustic signatures generated by all sound-producing organisms in a given habitat at a given moment. It includes [[animal communication|vocalizations]] that are used for [[conspecificity|conspecific]] communication in some cases. [[Anthropophony]] is another term introduced by Krause along with colleague, Stuart Gage. It represents human generated sound from either humans, themselves, or the electro-mechanical technologies they employ. Anthropophony is divided into two sub-categories. Controlled sound, such as music, language, and theatre, and chaotic or incoherent sound sometimes referred to as noise. .<ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2008\">Krause, Bernie. (2008). \"''Anatomy of the Soundscape: Evolving Perspectives'',\" J Aud Eng Soc. Vol 56 No 1/2 January/February.</ref> Various combinations of these acoustic expressions across space and time generate unique soundscapes.\n\nSoundscape ecologists seek to investigate the structure of soundscapes, explain how they are generated, and study how organisms interrelate acoustically. A number of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] have been proposed to explain the structure of soundscapes, particularly elements of biophony. For instance, an ecological theory known as the acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that acoustic signals of animals are altered in different physical environments in order to maximize their propagation through the habitat.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2008\"/> In addition, acoustic signals from organisms may be under [[evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] to minimize their [[frequency]] (pitch) overlap with other auditory features of the environment. This acoustic [[niche hypothesis]]  is analogous to the classical ecological concept of [[niche differentiation|niche partitioning]]. It suggests that acoustic signals in the environment should display frequency partitioning as a result of selection acting to maximize the effectiveness of [[intraspecific]] communication for different species. Observations of frequency differentiation among [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[frog|anuran]]s support the acoustic niche hypothesis.<ref>Bernie Krause 1993. \"The Niche Hypothesis: A virtual symphony of animal sounds, the origins of musical expression and the health of habitats,\" The Soundscape Newsletter./> file:///Users/garywf/Desktop/WFAE%20PROJECT/WFAE%20New/library/readings/niche.html</ref><ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2012\">Krause, Bernie.

For example, when compared with unaltered habitats, regions with high levels of urban land-use are likely to have increased levels of anthrophony and decreased physical and organismal sound sources. Soundscapes typically exhibit temporal patterns, with daily and [[season]]al cycles being particularly prominent.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> These patterns are often generated by the [[community (ecology)|communities]] of organisms that contribute to biophony. For example, birds [[dawn chorus (birds)|chorus]] heavily at dawn and dusk while anurans call primarily at night; the timing of these vocalization events may have evolved to minimize temporal overlap with other elements of the soundscape.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/><ref name=Patricelli_and_Blickley_2006>{{Cite journal | last1 = Patricelli | first1 = G.

However, acoustic ecology, which derives from the founding work of [[R. Murray Schafer]] and [[Barry Truax]], primarily focuses on human perception of soundscapes. Soundscape ecology seeks a broader perspective by considering soundscape effects on communities of living organisms, human and Other, and the potential interactions between sounds in the environment.<ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2012\"/> Compared to soundscape ecology, the discipline of [[bioacoustics]] tends to have a narrower interest in individual species\u2019 [[physiology|physiological]] and behavioral mechanisms of auditory communication. Soundscape ecology also borrows heavily from some concepts in [[landscape ecology]], which focuses on ecological patterns and processes occurring over multiple spatial scales.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> Landscapes may directly influence soundscapes as some organisms use physical features of their habitat to alter their vocalizations. For example, [[baboon]]s and other animals exploit specific habitats to generate [[echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] of the sounds they produce.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2012\"/>\n\nThe function and importance of sound in the environment may not be fully appreciated unless one adopts an organismal perspective on sound perception, and, in this way, soundscape ecology is also informed by [[sensory ecology]].<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> Sensory ecology focuses on understanding the [[sensory system]]s of organisms and the biological function of information obtained from these systems. In many cases, humans must acknowledge that sensory modalities and information used by other organisms may not be obvious from an anthropocentric viewpoint. This perspective has already highlighted many instances where organisms rely heavily on sound cues generated within their natural environments to perform important biological functions. For example, a broad range of [[crustacean]]s are known to respond to biophony generated around [[coral reef]]s. Species that must settle on reefs to complete their developmental cycle are attracted to reef noise while [[pelagic]] and [[nocturnal]] crustaceans are repelled by the same acoustic signal, presumably as a mechanism to avoid [[predation]] (predator densities are high in reef habitats).<ref name=Simpson_etal_2011>{{Cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = S.

Technological advances have provided improved methods for the collection of such data. Automated recording systems allow for temporally replicated samples of soundscapes to be gathered with relative ease. Data collected from such equipment can be extracted to generate a visual representation of the soundscape in the form of a [[spectrogram]].<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/> Spectrograms provide information on a number of sound properties that may be subject to quantitative analysis. The vertical axis of a spectrogram indicates the frequency of a sound while the horizontal axis displays the time scale over which sounds were recorded. In addition, spectrograms display the [[amplitude]] of sound, a measure of [[sound intensity]]. Ecological indices traditionally used with species-level data, such as [[species diversity|diversity]] and [[species evenness|evenness]], have been adapted for use with acoustic metrics.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/> These measures provide a method of comparing soundscapes across time or space. For example, automated recording devices have been used to gather acoustic data in different landscapes across yearlong time scales, and diversity metrics were employed to evaluate daily and seasonal fluctuations in soundscapes across sites. The demise of a habitat can be seen by measuring before and after \"logging\" for example.<ref name=\"unhealthy_habitat_differences_discovered\">{{cite news |last1=Sample |first1=Ian |last2=Jackson |first2=Graihagh |title=Soundscape ecology with Bernie Krause \u2013 Science Weekly podcast |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2018/jun/15/soundscape-ecology-with-bernie-krause-science-weekly-podcast |accessdate=16 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=June 15, 2018}}</ref><ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/>  Spatial patterns of sound may also be studied using tools familiar to [[landscape ecology|landscape ecologists]] such as [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> Finally, recorded samples of the soundscape can provide proxy measures for [[biodiversity]] inventories in cases where other sampling methods are impractical or inefficient.<ref name=Dumyahn_and_Pijanowski_2011>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dumyahn | first1 = S.

For instance, a large body of work has focused on documenting the effects of anthropophony on [[wildlife]]. Anthropophony (the uncontrolled version, is often used synonymously with [[noise pollution]]) can emanate from a variety of sources, including [[Transport network|transportation network]]s or industry, and may represent a pervasive disturbance to natural systems even in seemingly remote regions such as [[national park]]s.<ref name=Barber_etal_2010/> A major effect of noise is the masking of organismal acoustic signals that contain information. Against a noisy background, organisms may have trouble perceiving sounds that are important for intraspecific communication, foraging, [[predator avoidance|predator recognition]], or a variety of other ecological functions.<ref name=Barber_etal_2010/> In this way, anthropogenic noise may represent a soundscape interaction wherein increased anthropophony interferes with biophonic processes. The negative effects of anthropogenic noise impact a wide variety of taxa including fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals.<ref name=Laiolo_2010>{{Cite journal | last1 = Laiolo | first1 = P. | title = The emerging significance of bioacoustics in animal species conservation | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.025 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 143 | issue = 7 | pages = 1635\u20132013 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = | hdl = 10261/159286 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> In addition to interfering with ecologically important sounds, anthropophony can also directly affect the biological systems of organisms. Noise exposure, which may be perceived as a threat, can lead to [[physiology|physiological]] changes.<ref name=Barber_etal_2010/> For example, noise can increase levels of [[stress hormone]]s, impair [[cognition]], reduce [[immune system|immune function]], and induce [[DNA damage]].<ref name=Kight_and_Swaddle_2011>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kight | first1 = C.

Birds may be particularly sensitive to noise pollution given that they rely heavily on acoustic signals for intraspecific communication. Indeed, a wide range of studies demonstrate that birds use altered songs in noisy environments.<ref name=Laiolo_2010/> Research on [[great tit]]s in an urban environment revealed that male birds inhabiting noisy territories tended to use higher frequency sounds in their songs.<ref name=Slabbekoorn_and_Peet_2003>{{Cite journal | last1 = Slabbekoorn | first1 = H. | last2 = Peet | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1038/424267a | title = Ecology: Birds sing at a higher pitch in urban noise | journal = Nature | volume = 424 | issue = 6946 | pages = 267 | year = 2003 | pmid =  12867967| pmc = }}</ref> Presumably these higher-pitched songs allow male birds to be heard above anthropogenic noise, which tends to have high energy in the lower frequency range thereby masking sounds in that spectra.

First appearing in the ''Handbook for Acoustic Ecology'' edited by [[Barry Truax]], in 1978,<ref>Truax, Barry (1978). ''Handbook for Acoustic Ecology'', A. R. C Publications, Vancouver, BC.</ref> the term has occasionally been used, sometimes interchangeably, with the term [[acoustic ecology]]. Soundscape ecologists also study the relationships between the three basic sources of sound that comprise the soundscape: those generated by organisms are referred to as the [[biophony]]; those from non-biological natural categories are classified as the [[geophony]], and those produced by [[human]]s, the [[anthropophony]].\n\nIncreasingly, soundscapes are dominated by a sub-set of anthropophony (sometimes referred to in older, more archaic terminology as \"anthropogenic noise\"), or technophony, the overwhelming presence of electro-mechanical noise. This sub-class of [[noise pollution]] or disturbance may produce a negative effect on a wide range of organisms. Variations in [[soundscape]]s as a result of natural phenomena and human endeavor may have wide-ranging [[ecology|ecological]] effects as many organisms have evolved to respond to acoustic cues that emanate primarily from undisturbed habitats.\n\nSoundscape ecologists use [[digital recording|recording devices]], audio tools, and elements of traditional ecological and acoustic analyses to study soundscape structure. Soundscape ecology has deepened current understandings of ecological issues and established profound visceral connections to ecological data. The preservation of natural soundscapes is now a recognized [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] goal.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:River_Fluvi\u00e0_at_Olot_20060418_03.JPG|350px|thumb|Sounds produced by physical features of the environment such as running water contribute to natural soundscapes]]\nSoundscape ecology serves as a lens into other fields including medicine, music, dance, philosophy, environmental studies, etc. ([[soundscape|the soundscape]]).<ref>Krause, Bernie (August, 2015).

Non-biological in nature, it consists of the effect of wind in trees or grasses, water flowing in a stream, waves at an ocean or lake shoreline, and movement of the earth. [[Biophony]] is a term introduced by soundscape ecologist, [[Bernie Krause]], who in 1998, first began to express the soundscape in terms of its acoustic sources. The biophony refers to the collective acoustic signatures generated by all sound-producing organisms in a given habitat at a given moment. It includes [[animal communication|vocalizations]] that are used for [[conspecificity|conspecific]] communication in some cases. [[Anthropophony]] is another term introduced by Krause along with colleague, Stuart Gage. It represents human generated sound from either humans, themselves, or the electro-mechanical technologies they employ. Anthropophony is divided into two sub-categories. Controlled sound, such as music, language, and theatre, and chaotic or incoherent sound sometimes referred to as noise. .<ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2008\">Krause, Bernie. (2008). \"''Anatomy of the Soundscape: Evolving Perspectives'',\" J Aud Eng Soc. Vol 56 No 1/2 January/February.</ref> Various combinations of these acoustic expressions across space and time generate unique soundscapes.\n\nSoundscape ecologists seek to investigate the structure of soundscapes, explain how they are generated, and study how organisms interrelate acoustically. A number of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] have been proposed to explain the structure of soundscapes, particularly elements of biophony. For instance, an ecological theory known as the acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that acoustic signals of animals are altered in different physical environments in order to maximize their propagation through the habitat.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2008\"/> In addition, acoustic signals from organisms may be under [[evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] to minimize their [[frequency]] (pitch) overlap with other auditory features of the environment. This acoustic [[niche hypothesis]]  is analogous to the classical ecological concept of [[niche differentiation|niche partitioning]]. It suggests that acoustic signals in the environment should display frequency partitioning as a result of selection acting to maximize the effectiveness of [[intraspecific]] communication for different species. Observations of frequency differentiation among [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[frog|anuran]]s support the acoustic niche hypothesis.<ref>Bernie Krause 1993. \"The Niche Hypothesis: A virtual symphony of animal sounds, the origins of musical expression and the health of habitats,\" The Soundscape Newsletter./> file:///Users/garywf/Desktop/WFAE%20PROJECT/WFAE%20New/library/readings/niche.html</ref><ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2012\">Krause, Bernie.

For example, when compared with unaltered habitats, regions with high levels of urban land-use are likely to have increased levels of anthrophony and decreased physical and organismal sound sources. Soundscapes typically exhibit temporal patterns, with daily and [[season]]al cycles being particularly prominent.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> These patterns are often generated by the [[community (ecology)|communities]] of organisms that contribute to biophony.

However, acoustic ecology, which derives from the founding work of [[R. Murray Schafer]] and [[Barry Truax]], primarily focuses on human perception of soundscapes. Soundscape ecology seeks a broader perspective by considering soundscape effects on communities of living organisms, human and Other, and the potential interactions between sounds in the environment.<ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2012\"/> Compared to soundscape ecology, the discipline of [[bioacoustics]] tends to have a narrower interest in individual species\u2019 [[physiology|physiological]] and behavioral mechanisms of auditory communication. Soundscape ecology also borrows heavily from some concepts in [[landscape ecology]], which focuses on ecological patterns and processes occurring over multiple spatial scales.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> Landscapes may directly influence soundscapes as some organisms use physical features of their habitat to alter their vocalizations. For example, [[baboon]]s and other animals exploit specific habitats to generate [[echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] of the sounds they produce.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=\"Krause, Bernie 2012\"/>\n\nThe function and importance of sound in the environment may not be fully appreciated unless one adopts an organismal perspective on sound perception, and, in this way, soundscape ecology is also informed by [[sensory ecology]].<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/><ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> Sensory ecology focuses on understanding the [[sensory system]]s of organisms and the biological function of information obtained from these systems. In many cases, humans must acknowledge that sensory modalities and information used by other organisms may not be obvious from an anthropocentric viewpoint. This perspective has already highlighted many instances where organisms rely heavily on sound cues generated within their natural environments to perform important biological functions. For example, a broad range of [[crustacean]]s are known to respond to biophony generated around [[coral reef]]s. Species that must settle on reefs to complete their developmental cycle are attracted to reef noise while [[pelagic]] and [[nocturnal]] crustaceans are repelled by the same acoustic signal, presumably as a mechanism to avoid [[predation]] (predator densities are high in reef habitats).<ref name=Simpson_etal_2011>{{Cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = S.

Technological advances have provided improved methods for the collection of such data. Automated recording systems allow for temporally replicated samples of soundscapes to be gathered with relative ease. Data collected from such equipment can be extracted to generate a visual representation of the soundscape in the form of a [[spectrogram]].<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/> Spectrograms provide information on a number of sound properties that may be subject to quantitative analysis. The vertical axis of a spectrogram indicates the frequency of a sound while the horizontal axis displays the time scale over which sounds were recorded. In addition, spectrograms display the [[amplitude]] of sound, a measure of [[sound intensity]]. Ecological indices traditionally used with species-level data, such as [[species diversity|diversity]] and [[species evenness|evenness]], have been adapted for use with acoustic metrics.<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/> These measures provide a method of comparing soundscapes across time or space. For example, automated recording devices have been used to gather acoustic data in different landscapes across yearlong time scales, and diversity metrics were employed to evaluate daily and seasonal fluctuations in soundscapes across sites. The demise of a habitat can be seen by measuring before and after \"logging\" for example.<ref name=\"unhealthy_habitat_differences_discovered\">{{cite news |last1=Sample |first1=Ian |last2=Jackson |first2=Graihagh |title=Soundscape ecology with Bernie Krause \u2013 Science Weekly podcast |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2018/jun/15/soundscape-ecology-with-bernie-krause-science-weekly-podcast |accessdate=16 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=June 15, 2018}}</ref><ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/>  Spatial patterns of sound may also be studied using tools familiar to [[landscape ecology|landscape ecologists]] such as [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011b/> Finally, recorded samples of the soundscape can provide proxy measures for [[biodiversity]] inventories in cases where other sampling methods are impractical or inefficient.<ref name=Dumyahn_and_Pijanowski_2011>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dumyahn | first1 = S.

For instance, a large body of work has focused on documenting the effects of anthropophony on [[wildlife]]. Anthropophony (the uncontrolled version, is often used synonymously with [[noise pollution]]) can emanate from a variety of sources, including [[Transport network|transportation network]]s or industry, and may represent a pervasive disturbance to natural systems even in seemingly remote regions such as [[national park]]s.<ref name=Barber_etal_2010/> A major effect of noise is the masking of organismal acoustic signals that contain information. Against a noisy background, organisms may have trouble perceiving sounds that are important for intraspecific communication, foraging, [[predator avoidance|predator recognition]], or a variety of other ecological functions.<ref name=Barber_etal_2010/> In this way, anthropogenic noise may represent a soundscape interaction wherein increased anthropophony interferes with biophonic processes. The negative effects of anthropogenic noise impact a wide variety of taxa including fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals.<ref name=Laiolo_2010>{{Cite journal | last1 = Laiolo | first1 = P. | title = The emerging significance of bioacoustics in animal species conservation | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.025 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 143 | issue = 7 | pages = 1635\u20132013 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = | hdl = 10261/159286 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> In addition to interfering with ecologically important sounds, anthropophony can also directly affect the biological systems of organisms.

Birds may be particularly sensitive to noise pollution given that they rely heavily on acoustic signals for intraspecific communication. Indeed, a wide range of studies demonstrate that birds use altered songs in noisy environments.<ref name=Laiolo_2010/> Research on [[great tit]]s in an urban environment revealed that male birds inhabiting noisy territories tended to use higher frequency sounds in their songs.<ref name=Slabbekoorn_and_Peet_2003>{{Cite journal | last1 = Slabbekoorn | first1 = H. | last2 = Peet | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1038/424267a | title = Ecology: Birds sing at a higher pitch in urban noise | journal = Nature | volume = 424 | issue = 6946 | pages = 267 | year = 2003 | pmid =  12867967| pmc = }}</ref> Presumably these higher-pitched songs allow male birds to be heard above anthropogenic noise, which tends to have high energy in the lower frequency range thereby masking sounds in that spectra.

In the great tit, for example, there is a tradeoff between signal strength and signal detection that depends on song frequency.<ref name=Halfwerk_etal_2011a>{{Cite journal | last1 = Halfwerk | first1 = W. | last2 = Bot | first2 = S. | last3 = Buikx | first3 = J. | last4 = Van Der Velde | first4 = M. | last5 = Komdeur | first5 = J. | last6 = Ten Cate | first6 = C. | last7 = Slabbekoorn | first7 = H. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1109091108 | title = Low-frequency songs lose their potency in noisy urban conditions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 35 | pages = 14549\u201354 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21876157| pmc = 3167545}}</ref> Male birds that include more low frequency sounds in their song repertoire experience better sexual fidelity from their mates which results in increased reproductive success. However, low frequency sounds tend to be masked when anthropogenic noise is present, and high frequency songs are more effective at eliciting female responses under these conditions. Birds may therefore experience competing selective pressures in habitats with high levels of anthropogenic noise: pressure to call more at lower frequencies in order to improve signal strength and secure good mates versus opposing pressure to sing at higher frequencies in order to ensure that calls are detected against a background of anthrophony. In addition, use of certain vocalizations, including high amplitude sounds that reduce masking in noisy environments, may impose energetic costs that reduce fitness.<ref name=Patricelli_and_Blickley_2006/> Because of the reproductive trade-offs and other stresses they impose on some birds, noisy habitats may represent [[ecological trap]]s, habitats in which individuals have reduced fitness yet are colonized at rates greater than or equal to other habitats.<ref name=Laiolo_2010/><ref name=Robertson_and_Hutto_2006>{{Cite journal | last1 = Robertson | first1 = B.

One study focusing on community composition found that habitats exposed to anthropophony hosted fewer bird species than regions without noise, but both areas had similar numbers of nests.<ref name=Francis_etal_2009>{{Cite journal | last1 = Francis | first1 = C.

Thus, anthropophony can have negative effects on local species diversity, but the species capable of coping with noise disturbance may actually benefit from the exclusion of negative [[biological interaction|species interactions]] in those areas. Other experiments suggest that noise pollution has the potential to affect avian mating systems by altering the strength of [[pair bond]]s. When exposed to high amplitude environmental noise in a laboratory setting, [[zebra finch]]es, a [[monogamous]] species, show a decreased preference for their mated partners.<ref name=Swaddle_and_Page_2007>{{Cite journal | last1 = Swaddle | first1 = J.

However, soundscape ecology encourages biologists to consider natural soundscapes as resources worthy of conservation efforts. Soundscapes that come from relatively untrammeled habitats have value for wildlife as demonstrated by the numerous negative effects of anthropogenic noise on various species.<ref name=Barber_etal_2010/> Organisms that use acoustic cues generated by their prey may be particularly impacted by human-altered soundscapes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krause | first1 = Bernie | last2 = Farina | first2 = Almo | year = 2016 | title = Using ecoacoustic methods to survey the impacts of climate change on biodiversity | url = | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 195 | issue = | pages = 245\u2013254 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2016.01.013}}</ref> In this situation, the (unintentional) senders of the acoustic signals will have no incentive to compensate for masking imposed by anthropogenic sound. In addition, natural soundscapes can have benefits for human wellbeing and may help generate a distinct sense of place, connecting people to the environment and providing unique aesthetic experiences.<ref name=Dumyahn_and_Pijanowski_2011/> Because of the various values inherent in natural soundscapes, they may be considered [[ecosystem services]] that are provisioned by intact, functioning [[ecosystems]].<ref name=Pijanowski_etal_2011a/> Targets for soundscape conservation may include soundscapes necessary for the persistence of threatened wildlife, soundscapes that are themselves being severely altered by anthrophony, and soundscapes that represent unique places or cultural values.<ref name=Dumyahn_and_Pijanowski_2011/> Some governments and management agencies have begun to consider preservation of natural soundscapes as an environmental priority.<ref>Bernie Krause.
