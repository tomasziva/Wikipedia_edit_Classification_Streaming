Born in [[Cambridge]] and raised in [[Start Hill, Essex|Start Hill]], [[Essex]], she began posting songs on [[Myspace]] in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse [[raves]] and parties. In 2010 she signed a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]], releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Charli XCX rose to fame with the [[Icona Pop]] collaboration \"[[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|I Love It]]\", which became an international hit, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe. Her debut studio album, ''[[True Romance (Charli XCX album)|True Romance]]'' (2013), was released that year to critical acclaim but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the chorus and hook to \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\" by rapper [[Iggy Azalea]], which finished the year as one of the [[best-selling singles worldwide]] and was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s. The same year, she received her first solo hit with \"[[Boom Clap]]\", which became her third (first solo) Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her second studio album, the [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced ''[[Sucker (album)|Sucker]]'', was released at the end of the year, and produced the successful singles \"[[Break the Rules (Charli XCX song)|Break the Rules]]\" and \"[[Doing It (Charli XCX song)|Doing It]]\".\n\nIn 2015, Charli XCX began working with producers and artists in [[A. G. Cook]]'s British collective [[PC Music]], as well as producer [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]], developing a more experimental sound and image. While working on her third album, she released the ''[[Vroom Vroom (EP)|Vroom Vroom]]'' EP in 2016 and the mixtapes ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'' and ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]'' in 2017, as well as a series of singles including the BPI-certified \"[[After the Afterparty]]\", \"[[Boys (Charli XCX song)|Boys]]\", and \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\". In 2019, Charli XCX released her third studio album, ''[[Charli (album)|Charli]].''\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Charli XCX has co-written songs for other artists, including [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Beg for It (song)|Beg for It]]\" (2014), [[Selena Gomez]]'s \"[[Same Old Love]]\" (2015), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"[[Tonight (Blondie song)|Tonight]]\" (2017), and [[Shawn Mendes]]' collaboration with [[Camila Cabello]], \"[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]\" (2019).\n\n==Early life==\nCharlotte Emma Aitchison was born on 2 August 1992, in [[Cambridge]], England.

Born in [[Cambridge]] and raised in [[Start Hill, Essex|Start Hill]], [[Essex]], she began posting songs on [[Myspace]] in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse [[raves]] and parties. In 2010 she signed a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]], releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Charli XCX rose to fame with the [[Icona Pop]] collaboration \"[[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|I Love It]]\", which became an international hit, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe.

The same year, she received her first solo hit with \"[[Boom Clap]]\", which became her third (first solo) Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her second studio album, the [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced ''[[Sucker (album)|Sucker]]'', was released at the end of the year, and produced the successful singles \"[[Break the Rules (Charli XCX song)|Break the Rules]]\" and \"[[Doing It (Charli XCX song)|Doing It]]\".\n\nIn 2015, Charli XCX began working with producers and artists in [[A. G. Cook]]'s British collective [[PC Music]], as well as producer [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]], developing a more experimental sound and image. While working on her third album, she released the ''[[Vroom Vroom (EP)|Vroom Vroom]]'' EP in 2016 and the mixtapes ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'' and ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]'' in 2017, as well as a series of singles including the BPI-certified \"[[After the Afterparty]]\", \"[[Boys (Charli XCX song)|Boys]]\", and \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\". In 2019, Charli XCX released her third studio album, ''[[Charli (album)|Charli]].''\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Charli XCX has co-written songs for other artists, including [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Beg for It (song)|Beg for It]]\" (2014), [[Selena Gomez]]'s \"[[Same Old Love]]\" (2015), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"[[Tonight (Blondie song)|Tonight]]\" (2017), and [[Shawn Mendes]]' collaboration with [[Camila Cabello]], \"[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]\" (2019).\n\n==Early life==\nCharlotte Emma Aitchison was born on 2 August 1992, in [[Cambridge]], England.
