After attending [[Iowa State University]] for two years, he joined the Air Force from [[Royal, Iowa]], in 1954, and was commissioned through the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|aviation cadet program]] in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforce.togetherweserved.com/usaf/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=122616|title=Shadow box|website=airforce.togetherweserved.com}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nDethlefsen served as a Navigator on [[C-124 Globemaster]] transports at [[Dover Air Force Base]] from February 1957 to January 1959, and then entered Undergraduate Pilot Training at [[Bainbridge Air Force Base]].\n\nAfter receiving his pilot wings in February 1960 and attending combat crew training, Dethlefsen flew [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100 Super Sabres]] with the [[9th Fighter Squadron|9th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] at [[Spangdahlem Air Base]] from January 1961 to February 1965.\n\nHe flew with the [[560th Flying Training Squadron|560th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] at [[McConnell Air Force Base]] from February 1965 to October 1966, when he deployed to Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1965, he earned his college degree from [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], with a major in business <ref>[http://www.iowahistory.org/museum/exhibits/medal-of-honor/dethlefsen_m_vietnam/ Iowa Medal of Honor Heroes].</ref><ref name=\"veterantributes.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=217|title=Veteran Tributes|website=www.veterantributes.org}}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam and Medal of Honor Mission===\nOn 1966, he was deployed to [[Southeast Asia]]. Dethlefsen flew [[F-105 Thunderchief]] fighters with the [[333rd Fighter Squadron|333rd Tactical Fighter Squadron]] and then the [[354th Fighter Squadron|354th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] of [[355th Fighter Group|335th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]] at [[Thailand]], from October 1966 to June 1967. By March 10, 1967 had risen to the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].\n\nOn March 10, 1967, Dethlefsen refused to fly his badly damaged [[F-105 Thunderchief]] back to [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in Thailand. Instead, he stayed in the skies above the steel works at Thai Nguyen and completely destroyed a SAM-site before limping home. His courage in the face of a maelstrom of enemy fire earned him the third Medal of Honor given to an airman in the Vietnam War. Dethlefsen, flying the number three aircraft, and three other F-105s of Lincoln flight, flew ahead of a strike force of 72 fighter-bombers (F-105 Thunderchiefs from [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base|Korat]] and Takhli, and [[F-4 Phantom]]s from [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base|Ubon]]) heading to the Thai Nguyen iron and steel works.\n\nTheir job was to attack the surface-to-air missile complex, antiaircraft guns and a ring of automatic weapons guarding the target. On the first pass, his flight leader (F-105F 63-8335, piloted by David Everson and Jose Luna, both POW) was shot down by 85mm AAA fire and his wing man was forced to withdraw with severe damage. Dethlefsen then took command of the flight while fending off MiG attacks and responding to his own battle-damaged aircraft. As he maneuvered, he evaded an intercepting [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] by flying into heavy enemy antiaircraft fire. His F-105 was severely damaged, but he determined the aircraft could still fly.\n\nDespite his nearly crippled plane, Dethlefsen made repeated strikes with his wingman, Kenneth Bell, against the enemy's defensive positions. Evading a second MiG, Dethlefsen dove through the obscuring haze to locate the missile complex when he was again hit by flak. Making a final dive bombing attack and a strafing run with 20&nbsp;mm cannon fires, Dethlefsen effectively destroyed two missile sites before finally leaving for Takhli, 500 miles away. The mission was considered a success although two F-4s of the strike force were shot down.<ref>Chris Hobson, ''Vietnam Air Losses'', Midland Publishing, 2001</ref>\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson decorates Merlyn Dethlefsen with MOH 29-2619M.JPG|thumb|Dethlefsen receives the Medal of Honor from President Johnson]]\nDethlefsen could have pulled out of the mission on a number of occasions: when attacked by MiGs, when he and his wingman were hit by flak, or when the smoke of battle made it difficult to locate the enemy. But he decided to make repeated passes, each one more dangerous than the one before. For his actions, Dethlefsen was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on February 1, 1968. He became the third of 12 airmen so honored during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n===Post War===\nAfter his tour of duty in Vietnam, he served as an instructor pilot with the 3575th Pilot Training Squadron and 3576th Student Squadron at [[Vance Air Force Base]], from June 1967 to August 1971.\n\nDethlefsen next attended [[Air War College]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] graduating in June 1972. He was then assigned to the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] at [[Carlisle Barracks]], from June 1972 to 1974. Dethlefsen then became assistant director of operations for the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] wing at [[Beale Air Force Base]] before serving as director of operations for the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] wing at [[Dyess Air Force Base]], from 1975 till 1977<ref name=\"veterantributes.org\"/>\n\nHe retired from the Air Force in 1977 with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].

Dethlefsen was 1 of a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of [[F-105 Thunderchief|F-105]] aircraft engaged in a fire suppression mission designed to destroy a key antiaircraft defensive complex containing [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAM), an exceptionally heavy concentration of antiaircraft artillery, and other automatic weapons. The defensive network was situated to dominate the approach and provide protection to an important North Vietnamese industrial center that was scheduled to be attacked by [[fighter bomber]]s immediately after the strike by Maj. Dethlefsen's flight. In the initial attack on the defensive complex the lead aircraft was crippled, and Maj. Dethlefsen's aircraft was extensively damaged by the intense enemy fire. Realizing that the success of the impending fighter bomber attack on the center now depended on his ability to effectively suppress the defensive fire, Maj. Dethlefsen ignored the enemy's overwhelming firepower and the damage to his aircraft and pressed his attack. Despite a continuing hail of antiaircraft fire, deadly surface-to-air missiles, and counterattacks by [[Mikoyan|MIG]] interceptors, Maj. Dethlefsen flew repeated close range strikes to silence the enemy defensive positions with bombs and cannon fire. His action in rendering ineffective the defensive SAM and antiaircraft artillery sites enabled the ensuing fighter bombers to strike successfully the important industrial target without loss or damage to their aircraft, thereby appreciably reducing the enemy's ability to provide essential war material.
