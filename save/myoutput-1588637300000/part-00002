The cartoons are manic, beautifully animated, and feature amazing voice acting. Even the music tries to recapture the spirit of the originals.\" Even the characters are doing like what they did in old 30s and 40s shorts.<ref name=\"oneofus\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|tt8543208|Looney Tunes Cartoons}}\n\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n{{Peter Browngardt}}\n{{HBO Max}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Television|United States|Cartoon|Animation}}\n\n[[Category:Upcoming animated television series]]\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American children's comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:American flash animated television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
