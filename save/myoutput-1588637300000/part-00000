Covering both the public and private sectors, AScW largely represented laboratory and technical workers in universities, the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] and in chemical and metal manufacturing. The AScW could name half-a-dozen Nobel prize winners amongst its membership.\n\nBy the end of 1970 Clive Jenkins had become sole general secretary of the union. With advertising and personal appearances on television he kept ASTMS in the public's eye, within 15 years the union had expanded from 65,000 members to a figure approaching 500,000. This was achieved both by individual recruitment and by merging with small unions and staff associations, such as the [[Managers' and Overlookers' Society]], [[Medical Practitioners' Union]], the [[United Commercial Travellers' Association of Great Britain and Ireland]], the [[Union of Insurance Staffs]] and the [[Prudential Assurance Staff Association]]. The number of mergers was eventually to exceed 30.\n\nIn 1976 trade union activist [[Sheila McKechnie]] was appointed as the full-time Health and Safety Director of ASTMS. McKechnie remained with ASTMS until her appointment as Chief Executive of the homeless charity [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]].\n\nIn 1988 ASTMS merged with TASS ([[Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Section]]), the federated white collar section of the AUEW (Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers) to form MSF ([[Manufacturing, Science and Finance]]). On 1 January 2002 MSF was to amalgamate with the AEEU ([[Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union]], a successor to AUEW) to form [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]].\n\nOn 1 May 2007 [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]] merged with the [[TGWU]] to form [[Unite the Union|Unite]], which is the second biggest trade union in the UK.\n\n==Amalgamations==\nA large number of smaller unions merged into the ASTMS:\n* 1970: [[Medical Practitioners' Union]]<ref name=\"smethurst\">John B.
