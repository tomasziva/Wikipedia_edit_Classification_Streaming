The video game industry was impacted by the outbreak in various ways, most often due to concerns over travel to and from China or elsewhere or related to slowdowns in the manufacturing processes within China.\n\n==Overview==\nIn contrast to [[Socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|many other economic sectors that are drastically affected by the pandemic]], the video game industry was generally more resilient to the pandemic. Most video game developers, publishers and operators were able to maintain operations with employees working from home to sustain game development and digital releases, though as stay-at-home orders persisted, some productivity issues arose.<ref name=\"nytimes april sales\">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/technology/personaltech/coronavirus-video-game-production.html | title = Gaming Sales Are Up, but Production Is Down | first = Jason | last = Schreier | author-link = Jason Schreier | date = April 21, 2020 | accessdate = April 22, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Further, with many people globally at home and unable to work, online gaming saw the record numbers of players during the pandemic as a popular activity to counter [[social distancing]], a practice recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]<ref name=\"who video games\"/> which helped to boost revenues for many companies.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/gaming/coronavirus-videogames-industry-impact/ |title = Game (still) on: How coronavirus is impacting the gaming industry | first = Nick | last=  Romero | date = March 19, 2020 | access-date = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html | title=  The world is turning to video games amid coronavirus outbreak | first= Daniel | last = Howley | date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Yahoo!]] }}</ref>\n\nThere were still negative impacts on the industry, notably with major trade events like the [[E3 2020]] cancelled or postponed which may impact relationships between the smaller developers and publishers. This particularly impacted [[indie developers]] who typically used these events for face-to-face meetings with potential partners to gain funding and publishing support, and required them to delay or cancel projects.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-08-what-does-a-year-without-events-mean-for-indies | title = What does a year without events mean for indies? | first = Ryland H. | last = Garnett | date = April 8, 2020 | accessdate = April 10, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Further, many esport leagues had to alter plans for their games, transitioning from live events to remote play or cancellation altogether.

The video game industry was impacted by the outbreak in various ways, most often due to concerns over travel to and from China or elsewhere or related to slowdowns in the manufacturing processes within China.\n\n==Overview==\nIn contrast to [[Socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|many other economic sectors that are drastically affected by the pandemic]], the video game industry was generally more resilient to the pandemic. Most video game developers, publishers and operators were able to maintain operations with employees working from home to sustain game development and digital releases, though as stay-at-home orders persisted, some productivity issues arose.<ref name=\"nytimes april sales\">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/technology/personaltech/coronavirus-video-game-production.html | title = Gaming Sales Are Up, but Production Is Down | first = Jason | last = Schreier | author-link = Jason Schreier | date = April 21, 2020 | accessdate = April 22, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Further, with many people globally at home and unable to work, online gaming saw the record numbers of players during the pandemic as a popular activity to counter [[social distancing]], a practice recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]<ref name=\"who video games\"/> which helped to boost revenues for many companies.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/gaming/coronavirus-videogames-industry-impact/ |title = Game (still) on: How coronavirus is impacting the gaming industry | first = Nick | last=  Romero | date = March 19, 2020 | access-date = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html | title=  The world is turning to video games amid coronavirus outbreak | first= Daniel | last = Howley | date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Yahoo!]] }}</ref>\n\nThere were still negative impacts on the industry, notably with major trade events like the [[E3 2020]] cancelled or postponed which may impact relationships between the smaller developers and publishers. This particularly impacted [[indie developers]] who typically used these events for face-to-face meetings with potential partners to gain funding and publishing support, and required them to delay or cancel projects.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-08-what-does-a-year-without-events-mean-for-indies | title = What does a year without events mean for indies? | first = Ryland H. | last = Garnett | date = April 8, 2020 | accessdate = April 10, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Further, many esport leagues had to alter plans for their games, transitioning from live events to remote play or cancellation altogether.
