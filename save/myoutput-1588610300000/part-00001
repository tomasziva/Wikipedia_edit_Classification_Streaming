While no set timetable has been set, the league is working on a goal of establishing a franchise by around 2021, assuming they have all the necessary arrangements in place. It is believed this would be most likely achieved through relocation of an existing franchise, with the Jaguars most often linked due to their association with the International Series, even though their owner is said to be content with the current arrangement and other franchises have more reason to move (the most often cited being poor on-field performance, lack of fans and uncertainty over stadium leases). The NFL has used some of the specific arrangements for the International Series games as a test bed for predicting how a London franchise could be made effective from a logistical and competitiveness standpoint.<ref name=\"lacanfora20121028\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/jason-la-canfora/20724077/nfls-move-to-london-could-come-soon-jags-a-target |title=NFL's move to London could come soon; Jags a target |work=CBS Sports |date=October 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |last=La Canfora |first=Jason }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Dave |first2=John |last2=Krawczynski |date=May 7, 2012 |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/vikings-limbo-expansion-not-nfls-173245299--nfl.html |title=Vikings in limbo and expansion not on NFL's radar |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=May 7, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the start of the 2019 season, the \"extreme long shot\" possibility arose that the [[Oakland Raiders]], due to legal disputes with the city of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], could [[Potential London NFL franchise|play all of their home games in London]] in 2019; they are already slated to host one regular season game abroad and also will host one of their preseason games in Canada.
