Landings here were necessary to link the British landings to the east at [[Gold Beach|Gold]] with the American landing to the west at [[Utah Beach|Utah]], thus providing a continuous [[lodgement]] on the Normandy coast of the [[Bay of the Seine]]. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of [[United States Army]] troops, with sea transport, mine sweeping, and [[List of ships in Omaha Bombardment Group|a naval bombardment force]] provided predominantly by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], with contributions from the [[Royal Navy|British]], [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]], and [[Free French Naval Forces|Free French]] navies.\n\nThe primary objective at Omaha was to secure a [[beachhead]] of {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} depth, between [[Port-en-Bessin]] and the [[Vire River]], linking with the British landings at Gold to the east, and reaching the area of [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]] to the west to link up with VII Corps landing at Utah. Opposing the landings was the German [[352nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|352nd Infantry Division]]. Of the 12,020 men of the division, 6,800 were experienced combat troops, detailed to defend a {{convert|53|km|sp=us|adj=on}} front. The German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line, and the defenses were mainly deployed in strongpoints along the coast. The untested American [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Infantry Division]], along with nine [[company (military unit)|companies]] of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] redirected from [[Pointe du Hoc]], assaulted the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of [[tank]]s, [[infantry]], and [[combat engineer]] forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.\n\nVery little went as planned during the landing at Omaha. Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of [[landing craft]] to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing U.S. troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days.\n\n== Terrain and defenses ==\n[[File:Omaha beach cross section.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|right|Diagrammatic cross section of the beach at Omaha]]\n\nThe coastline of Normandy was divided into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a [[spelling alphabet]]\u2014from Able, west of Omaha, to Roger on the east flank of [[Sword Beach|Sword]]. Omaha was originally designated ''X-Ray'', from the phonetic alphabet of the day. Two names were changed on 3 March 1944; with Omaha and Utah probably suggested by Omar Bradley, as two privates fitting out his London headquarters were from Omaha, Nebraska (Gayle Eyler) and Provo, Utah; they were not named after the corps commanders, who were from Virginia (Gerow) and Louisiana (Collins).{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2019|pp=136-139}} Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include [[Utah Beach|Utah]] on the Cotentin Peninsula.

At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.\n\n=== Engineer landings ===\nLike the infantry, the engineers had been pushed off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations. Three teams came in where there were no infantry or armor to cover them. Working under heavy fire, the engineers set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles\u2014work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40%.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 42\u201343}}</ref><ref>http://www.americandday.org/Veterans/Ross_Wesley.html eyewitness account</ref>\n\n== Second assault wave ==\n[[File:Omaha Beach 1944 Second Assault.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Official history map showing the second assault wave landings.]]\n\nWith the initial targets unaccomplished, the second and larger wave of assault landings brought in reinforcements, support weapons and headquarters elements at 07:00 to face nearly the same difficulties as had the first. The second wave was larger, and so the defenders' fire was less concentrated. The survivors of the first wave were unable to provide effective covering fire, and in places the fresh landing troops suffered casualty rates as high as those of the first wave. Failure to clear paths through the beach obstacles also added to the difficulties of the second wave. In addition, the incoming tide was beginning to hide the remaining obstacles, causing high attrition among the landing craft before they had reached the shore. As in the initial landings, difficult navigation caused disruptive mislandings, scattering the infantry and separating vital headquarters elements from their units.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 49}}</ref>\n\nOn the 116th RCT front, the remainder of the 1st Battalion, B/116, C/116 and D/116, were due to land in support of A/116 at Dog Green.

Their exact casualties in getting across the beach are unknown, but the one-third to one-half that made it to shore spent the rest of the day pinned down by [[sniper]]s.

As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, with a handful of tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 50}}</ref> Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brig.&nbsp;Gen. [[Norman Cota|Norman \"Dutch\" Cota]], was able to land relatively unscathed.<ref name=\"OffHist_p53\"/>\n\nFurther east, the strongpoint defenses were effective. On the Dog Red/Easy Green boundary, the defenses around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy toll on the remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins was too weak to have any effect and was forced back down.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 51\u201352}}</ref> To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green/Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 52}}</ref>\n\nOn the 16th RCT front, at the eastern end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints.

Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it \u2013 they were put out of action for several hours.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nOn the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, elements of five different companies had become entangled, and the situation was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, three of the four remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle.

Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 54\u201357}}</ref>\n\nThe survivors at the shingle, many facing combat for the first time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars.

While the 916th regiment, defending the center of the 352nd zone, was reporting that the landings had been frustrated, it was also requesting reinforcements. The request could not be met, because the situation elsewhere in [[Normandy]] was becoming more urgent for the defenders. The reserve force of the German 352nd division, the 915th regiment, which had earlier been deployed against the [[American airborne landings in Normandy|US airborne landings]] to the west of Omaha, was diverted to the Gold zone east of Omaha, where German defenses were crumbling.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/7-4/7-4_8.HTM|title= Cross-Channel Attack|accessdate=2007-06-22 |first= Gordon A.|last= Harrison|publisher= Historical Division, War Department |year= 1951|pages=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\n== Breakthrough ==\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=\"Are you going to lay there and get killed, or get up and do something about it?\"\n|source=Unidentified lieutenant, Easy Red.<ref name=\"OffHist_p57\"/>}}\n\nThe key geographical features that had influenced the landings also influenced the next phase of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 58}}</ref>\n\nThe other key aspect of the next few hours was leadership. The original plan was in tatters, with so many units mis-landed, disorganized and scattered. Most commanders had fallen or were absent, and there were few ways to communicate, other than shouted commands. In places, small groups of men, sometimes scratched together from different companies, in some cases from different divisions, were \"...inspired, encouraged or bullied...\"<ref name=\"OffHist_p57\"/> out of the relative safety of the shingle, starting the dangerous task of reducing the defenses atop the bluffs.\n\n=== Assaulting the bluffs ===\n[[File:Omaha beach aerial view draws.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Aerial view of Omaha showing the draws, left to right; Vierville (D-1), Les Moulins (D-3), St. Laurent (E-1), Colleville (E-3) and \"Number 5 Draw\" (F-1).]]\n\nSurvivors of C company 2nd Rangers in the first wave landed on Dog Green around 06:45; by 07:30, they had scaled the cliffs near Dog Green and the Vierville draw.

Finding targets difficult to spot, and in fear of hitting their own troops, the big guns of the [[battleship]]s and [[cruiser]]s concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches.

Thinking she would turn back out to sea, the engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up, guns still firing. At one point, gunners aboard the ''Frankford'' saw an immobilized tank at the water's edge, still firing. Watching the fall of its shot, they followed up with a salvo of their own.

The German emphasis on this [[Main Line of Resistance]] (MLR) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker, and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength. This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland, making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas, let alone achieve their D-Day objectives.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/7-4/7-4_8.HTM|title= Cross-Channel Attack|accessdate=2007-06-22 |first= Gordon A. |last=Harrison|publisher= Historical Division, War Department |year= 1951|page=326}}</ref> As an example of the effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers, the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow. One [[platoon]] attempted to outflank the position, only to run into another machine gun position to the left of the first. A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third, and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position. The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons off the beach meant that, after four hours, the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch5.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 93}}</ref>\n\n== Beachhead ==\n[[File:Normandy Invasion June 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Omaha on the afternoon of D-Day]]\n\nDespite penetrations inland, the key beach objectives had not been achieved. The draws necessary for the movement of vehicles off the beach had not been opened, and the strongpoints defending these were still putting up a spirited resistance. The failure to clear beach obstacles forced subsequent landings to concentrate on Easy Green and Easy Red.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 79}}</ref>\n\nWhere vehicles were landing, they found a narrow strip of beach with no shelter from enemy fire. Around 08:30, commanders suspended all such landings. This caused a jam of landing craft out to sea. The DUKWs had a particularly hard time of it in the rough conditions. 13 DUKWs carried the [[111th Field Artillery battalion]] of the 116th RCT; five were swamped soon after disembarking from the LCT, four were lost as they circled in the rendezvous area while waiting to land, and one capsized as they turned for the beach. Two were destroyed by enemy fire as they approached the beach and the lone survivor managed to offload its howitzer to a passing craft before it also succumbed to the sea. This one gun eventually landed in the afternoon.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page = 80}}</ref>\n\nThe official record of Omaha reports that \"...the tanks were leading a hard life...\".

Scattered along the length of the beach, trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders, tanks had to be controlled individually. This was perilous work. The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery, who had landed ahead of his unit, was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank. The command group of the 741st tank battalion lost three out of their group of five in their efforts. Additionally, the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders. When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong-points defending the E-3 draw, a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks. Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11:00. Only three were able to reach the rallying point, and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up the draw, forcing the remaining tank to back off.\n\n[[File:Omaha Beach American Casualty.jpg|thumb|left|An American casualty of the morning's battle]]\n\nReinforcement regiments were due to land by battalion, beginning with the 18th RCT at 09:30 on Easy Red. The first battalion to land, 2/18, arrived at the E-1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion off shore. Casualties were light, though. Despite the existence of a narrow channel through the beach obstacles, the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss 22 LCVPs, 2 LCI(L)s and 4 LCTs. Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire, the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11:30 of the last strong-point defending the entrance to the E-1 draw. Although a usable exit was finally opened, congestion prevented an early exploitation inland. The three battalions of the 115th RCT, scheduled to land from 10:30 on Dog Red and Easy Green, came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red. The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13:00, and delayed the move off the beach of all but 2/18, which had exited the beach further east before noon, until 14:00. Even then, this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 82\u201385}}</ref>\n\nBy early afternoon, the strong-point guarding the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough force on the ground to mop up the remaining defenders, the exit could not be opened. Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall, and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch5.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 95}}</ref>\n\nThe advance of the 18th RCT cleared away the last remnants of the force defending the E-1 draw. When engineers cut a road up the western side of this draw, it became the main route inland off the beaches. With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved, they were re-opened for the landing of vehicles by 14:00. Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E-1 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 104}}</ref>\n\nThe F-1 draw, initially considered too steep for use, was also eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road. In the absence of any real progress opening the D-3 and E-3 draws, landing schedules were revised to take advantage of this route, and a company of tanks from the 745th tank battalion were able to reach the high ground by 20:00.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 106}}</ref>\n\nApproaches to the exits were also cleared, with minefields lifted and holes blown in the embankment to permit the passage of vehicles.

The main advance was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment, with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached, south and south-eastwards. The heaviest opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers. Attempts by 3/26 and B/18 with support from the tanks of B/745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8. The threat of an armored counterattack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8. The 26th Infantry Regiment's three battalions, having been attached to the 16th, 18th and 115th Regiments the previous day, spent June 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards, forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin.

Landings here were necessary to link the British landings to the east at [[Gold Beach|Gold]] with the American landing to the west at [[Utah Beach|Utah]], thus providing a continuous [[lodgement]] on the Normandy coast of the [[Bay of the Seine]]. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of [[United States Army]] troops, with sea transport, mine sweeping, and [[List of ships in Omaha Bombardment Group|a naval bombardment force]] provided predominantly by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], with contributions from the [[Royal Navy|British]], [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]], and [[Free French Naval Forces|Free French]] navies.\n\nThe primary objective at Omaha was to secure a [[beachhead]] of {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} depth, between [[Port-en-Bessin]] and the [[Vire River]], linking with the British landings at Gold to the east, and reaching the area of [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]] to the west to link up with VII Corps landing at Utah. Opposing the landings was the German [[352nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|352nd Infantry Division]]. Of the 12,020 men of the division, 6,800 were experienced combat troops, detailed to defend a {{convert|53|km|sp=us|adj=on}} front. The German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line, and the defenses were mainly deployed in strongpoints along the coast. The untested American [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Infantry Division]], along with nine [[company (military unit)|companies]] of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] redirected from [[Pointe du Hoc]], assaulted the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of [[tank]]s, [[infantry]], and [[combat engineer]] forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.\n\nVery little went as planned during the landing at Omaha. Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of [[landing craft]] to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing U.S. troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days.\n\n== Terrain and defenses ==\n[[File:Omaha beach cross section.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|right|Diagrammatic cross section of the beach at Omaha]]\n\nThe coastline of Normandy was divided into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a [[spelling alphabet]]\u2014from Able, west of Omaha, to Roger on the east flank of [[Sword Beach|Sword]].

Two names were changed on 3 March 1944; with Omaha and Utah probably suggested by Omar Bradley, as two privates fitting out his London headquarters were from Omaha, Nebraska (Gayle Eyler) and Provo, Utah; they were not named after the corps commanders, who were from Virginia (Gerow) and Louisiana (Collins).{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2019|pp=136-139}} Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include [[Utah Beach|Utah]] on the Cotentin Peninsula.

They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 48\u201349}}</ref> All the other companies were, at best, disorganized, mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions. At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.\n\n=== Engineer landings ===\nLike the infantry, the engineers had been pushed off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations. Three teams came in where there were no infantry or armor to cover them. Working under heavy fire, the engineers set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles\u2014work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40%.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 42\u201343}}</ref><ref>http://www.americandday.org/Veterans/Ross_Wesley.html eyewitness account</ref>\n\n== Second assault wave ==\n[[File:Omaha Beach 1944 Second Assault.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Official history map showing the second assault wave landings.]]\n\nWith the initial targets unaccomplished, the second and larger wave of assault landings brought in reinforcements, support weapons and headquarters elements at 07:00 to face nearly the same difficulties as had the first. The second wave was larger, and so the defenders' fire was less concentrated. The survivors of the first wave were unable to provide effective covering fire, and in places the fresh landing troops suffered casualty rates as high as those of the first wave. Failure to clear paths through the beach obstacles also added to the difficulties of the second wave. In addition, the incoming tide was beginning to hide the remaining obstacles, causing high attrition among the landing craft before they had reached the shore. As in the initial landings, difficult navigation caused disruptive mislandings, scattering the infantry and separating vital headquarters elements from their units.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 49}}</ref>\n\nOn the 116th RCT front, the remainder of the 1st Battalion, B/116, C/116 and D/116, were due to land in support of A/116 at Dog Green. Three boats, including their headquarters and beach-master groups, landed too far west, under the cliffs. Their exact casualties in getting across the beach are unknown, but the one-third to one-half that made it to shore spent the rest of the day pinned down by [[sniper]]s. Not all sections of the badly scattered B/116 landed there, but those that did were quickly forced to join those survivors of A/116 fighting for survival at the water's edge.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 50\u201351}}</ref> Two companies of 2nd Rangers, coming in later on the edge of Dog Green, did manage to reach the seawall, but at the cost of half their strength.<ref name=\"OffHist_p53\">{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 53}}</ref>\n\nTo the left of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a different story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, with a handful of tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 50}}</ref> Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brig.&nbsp;Gen. [[Norman Cota|Norman \"Dutch\" Cota]], was able to land relatively unscathed.<ref name=\"OffHist_p53\"/>\n\nFurther east, the strongpoint defenses were effective. On the Dog Red/Easy Green boundary, the defenses around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy toll on the remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins was too weak to have any effect and was forced back down.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 51\u201352}}</ref> To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green/Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 52}}</ref>\n\nOn the 16th RCT front, at the eastern end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support battalion to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it \u2013 they were put out of action for several hours.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nOn the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, elements of five different companies had become entangled, and the situation was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, three of the four remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 54}}</ref>\n\n=== American situation ===\n[[File:American assault troops at Omaha Beach 02.jpg|thumb|left|Assault troops of the 3rd Battalion, 16th RCT, from the first two waves, shelter under the chalk cliffs (which identify this as an area of Fox Red).]]\n\nAlong with the infantry landing in the second wave, supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies. [[Combat engineer]]s, tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches, landed off-target and without their equipment.\n\nMany [[half-track]]s, [[Willys MA|jeeps]] and trucks foundered in deep water; those that made it ashore soon became jammed up on the narrowing beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch3.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 54\u201357}}</ref>\n\nThe survivors at the shingle, many facing combat for the first time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars.

While the 916th regiment, defending the center of the 352nd zone, was reporting that the landings had been frustrated, it was also requesting reinforcements. The request could not be met, because the situation elsewhere in [[Normandy]] was becoming more urgent for the defenders. The reserve force of the German 352nd division, the 915th regiment, which had earlier been deployed against the [[American airborne landings in Normandy|US airborne landings]] to the west of Omaha, was diverted to the Gold zone east of Omaha, where German defenses were crumbling.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/7-4/7-4_8.HTM|title= Cross-Channel Attack|accessdate=2007-06-22 |first= Gordon A.|last= Harrison|publisher= Historical Division, War Department |year= 1951|pages=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\n== Breakthrough ==\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=\"Are you going to lay there and get killed, or get up and do something about it?\"\n|source=Unidentified lieutenant, Easy Red.<ref name=\"OffHist_p57\"/>}}\n\nThe key geographical features that had influenced the landings also influenced the next phase of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 58}}</ref>\n\nThe other key aspect of the next few hours was leadership. The original plan was in tatters, with so many units mis-landed, disorganized and scattered. Most commanders had fallen or were absent, and there were few ways to communicate, other than shouted commands. In places, small groups of men, sometimes scratched together from different companies, in some cases from different divisions, were \"...inspired, encouraged or bullied...\"<ref name=\"OffHist_p57\"/> out of the relative safety of the shingle, starting the dangerous task of reducing the defenses atop the bluffs.\n\n=== Assaulting the bluffs ===\n[[File:Omaha beach aerial view draws.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Aerial view of Omaha showing the draws, left to right; Vierville (D-1), Les Moulins (D-3), St. Laurent (E-1), Colleville (E-3) and \"Number 5 Draw\" (F-1).]]\n\nSurvivors of C company 2nd Rangers in the first wave landed on Dog Green around 06:45; by 07:30, they had scaled the cliffs near Dog Green and the Vierville draw.

Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party established themselves at the top of the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east.

The German emphasis on this [[Main Line of Resistance]] (MLR) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker, and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength. This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland, making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas, let alone achieve their D-Day objectives.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/7-4/7-4_8.HTM|title= Cross-Channel Attack|accessdate=2007-06-22 |first= Gordon A. |last=Harrison|publisher= Historical Division, War Department |year= 1951|page=326}}</ref> As an example of the effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers, the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow. One [[platoon]] attempted to outflank the position, only to run into another machine gun position to the left of the first. A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third, and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position.

Around 08:30, commanders suspended all such landings. This caused a jam of landing craft out to sea. The DUKWs had a particularly hard time of it in the rough conditions. 13 DUKWs carried the [[111th Field Artillery battalion]] of the 116th RCT; five were swamped soon after disembarking from the LCT, four were lost as they circled in the rendezvous area while waiting to land, and one capsized as they turned for the beach. Two were destroyed by enemy fire as they approached the beach and the lone survivor managed to offload its howitzer to a passing craft before it also succumbed to the sea.

Scattered along the length of the beach, trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders, tanks had to be controlled individually. This was perilous work. The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery, who had landed ahead of his unit, was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank. The command group of the 741st tank battalion lost three out of their group of five in their efforts. Additionally, the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders. When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong-points defending the E-3 draw, a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks. Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11:00. Only three were able to reach the rallying point, and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up the draw, forcing the remaining tank to back off.\n\n[[File:Omaha Beach American Casualty.jpg|thumb|left|An American casualty of the morning's battle]]\n\nReinforcement regiments were due to land by battalion, beginning with the 18th RCT at 09:30 on Easy Red. The first battalion to land, 2/18, arrived at the E-1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion off shore. Casualties were light, though. Despite the existence of a narrow channel through the beach obstacles, the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss 22 LCVPs, 2 LCI(L)s and 4 LCTs. Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire, the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11:30 of the last strong-point defending the entrance to the E-1 draw. Although a usable exit was finally opened, congestion prevented an early exploitation inland. The three battalions of the 115th RCT, scheduled to land from 10:30 on Dog Red and Easy Green, came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red. The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13:00, and delayed the move off the beach of all but 2/18, which had exited the beach further east before noon, until 14:00. Even then, this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|pages= 82\u201385}}</ref>\n\nBy early afternoon, the strong-point guarding the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough force on the ground to mop up the remaining defenders, the exit could not be opened. Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall, and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch5.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 95}}</ref>\n\nThe advance of the 18th RCT cleared away the last remnants of the force defending the E-1 draw. When engineers cut a road up the western side of this draw, it became the main route inland off the beaches. With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved, they were re-opened for the landing of vehicles by 14:00. Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E-1 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 104}}</ref>\n\nThe F-1 draw, initially considered too steep for use, was also eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road. In the absence of any real progress opening the D-3 and E-3 draws, landing schedules were revised to take advantage of this route, and a company of tanks from the 745th tank battalion were able to reach the high ground by 20:00.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 106}}</ref>\n\nApproaches to the exits were also cleared, with minefields lifted and holes blown in the embankment to permit the passage of vehicles. As the tide receded, engineers were also able to resume their work of clearing the beach obstacles, and by the end of the evening, 13 gaps were opened and marked.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/100-11/ch4.htm|title= Omaha Beachhead|accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher= Historical Division, War Department |date= 20 September 1945|page= 102}}</ref>\n\n=== German reactions ===\nObserving the build-up of shipping off the beach, and in an attempt to contain what were regarded as minor penetrations at Omaha, a battalion was detached from the 915th Regiment being deployed against the British to the east. Along with an anti-tank company, this force was attached to the 916th Regiment and committed to a counterattack in the Colleville area in the early afternoon.

At midnight [[Dietrich Kraiss|General Dietrich Kraiss]], commander of the 352nd Division, reporting the total loss of men and equipment in the coastal positions, advised that he had sufficient forces to contain the Americans on D+1 but that he would need reinforcements thereafter, to be told that there were no more reserves available.<ref name=\"GermanCasualties\">{{cite web |url= http://www.army.mil/cmh/books/wwii/7-4/7-4_8.HTM|title= Cross-Channel Attack|accessdate=2007-06-22 |first= Gordon A. |last=Harrison|publisher= Historical Division, War Department |year= 1951|page=334}}</ref>\n\n== End of the day ==\n[[File:Omaha Beach 1944 Evening.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Official history map showing extent of advances made by evening.]]\n\nFollowing the penetrations inland, confused hard-fought individual actions pushed the foothold out {{convert|2+1/2|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} deep in the Colleville area to the east, less than that west of St. Laurent, and an isolated penetration in the Vierville area.

With the original objective yet to be achieved, the priority for the Allies was to link up all the Normandy beachheads.<ref name=\"Badsey_p87\"/> During the course of June 7, while still under sporadic shellfire, the beach was prepared as a supply area. Surplus cargo ships were deliberately sunk to form an artificial breakwater and, while still less than planned, 1,429 tons of stores were landed that day.<ref>{{cite book |last= Badsey|first= Stephen| last2= Bean|first2= Tim|title= Omaha Beach |year= 2004|publisher= Sutton Publishing |isbn= 0-7509-3017-9|pages= 96\u201397}}</ref>\n\nWith the beach assault phase completed the RCTs reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions and over the course of the next two days achieved the original D-Day objectives. On the 1st divisional front the 18th Infantry Regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from the 916th and 726th Grenadiers to break out of WN-63 and Colleville, both of which were subsequently taken by the 16th Infantry Regiment which also moved on [[Port-en-Bessin]]. The main advance was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment, with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached, south and south-eastwards. The heaviest opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers. Attempts by 3/26 and B/18 with support from the tanks of B/745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8. The threat of an armored counterattack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8. The 26th Infantry Regiment's three battalions, having been attached to the 16th, 18th and 115th Regiments the previous day, spent June 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards, forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin. By the morning of June 9 the 1st Division had established contact with the British XXX Corps, thus linking Omaha with Gold.<ref>{{cite book |last= Badsey|first= Stephen| last2= Bean|first2= Tim|title= Omaha Beach |year= 2004|publisher= Sutton Publishing |isbn= 0-7509-3017-9|pages= 94\u201395, 98\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nOn the 29th divisional front two battalions of the 116th Infantry Regiment cleared the last defenders from the bluffs while the remaining 116th battalion joined the Rangers in their move west along the coast. This force relieved the 2nd Ranger companies who were holding Pointe du Hoc on June 8 and subsequently forced the German 914th Grenadiers and the 439th Ost-Battalion to withdraw from the [[Grandcamp-Maisy|Grandcamp]] area which lay further to the west. Early on June 7 WN-69 defending St. Laurent was abandoned and the 115th Infantry Regiment was therefore able to push inland to the south-west, reaching the Formigny area on June 7 and the original D-Day [[phase line (cartography)|phase line]] the following day. The third regiment of 29th Division; the 175th, started landing on June 7. By the morning of June 9 this regiment had taken Isigny and on the evening of the following day forward patrols established contact with the [[101st Airborne Division]], thus linking Omaha with Utah.<ref>{{cite book |last= Badsey|first= Stephen| last2= Bean|first2= Tim|title= Omaha Beach |year= 2004|publisher= Sutton Publishing |isbn= 0-7509-3017-9|pages= 92\u201394, 97\u2013100}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Omaha Beach Nowadays.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Omaha landscape 67 years after landing.

Construction of 'Mulberry A' at Omaha began the day after D-Day with the scuttling of ships to form a breakwater. By D+10 the harbor became operational when the first pier was completed; ''LST 342'' docking and unloading 78 vehicles in 38 minutes. Three days later the worst storm to hit Normandy in 40 years began to blow, raging for three days and not abating until the night of June 22. The harbor was so badly damaged that the decision was taken not to repair it; supplies being subsequently landed directly on the beach until fixed port facilities were captured.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/1/2004_1_26.shtml |title= A Harbor Built from Scratch |accessdate= 2007-09-10 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071203072712/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/1/2004_1_26.shtml |archivedate= 2007-12-03 }}</ref> In the few days that the harbor was operational, 11,000 troops, 2,000 vehicles and 9,000 tons of equipment and supplies were brought ashore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.transchool.eustis.army.mil/museum/Mulberry.htm |title= Operation Mulberry|publisher= U.S. Army Transportation Museum| accessdate=2007-09-10|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114003437/http://www.transchool.eustis.army.mil/museum/Mulberry.htm |archivedate = November 14, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over the 100 days following D-Day more than 1,000,000 tons of supplies, 100,000 vehicles and 600,000 men were landed, and 93,000 casualties were evacuated, via Omaha.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/bridge1.htm |title= Bridge to the Past\u2014Engineers in World War II|publisher= US Army Corps of Engineers| accessdate=2007-09-11| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070823150646/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/bridge1.htm| archivedate = August 23, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crosses, Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, June 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The Normandy American Cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach]]\n\nToday at Omaha jagged remains of the harbor can be seen at low tide.
