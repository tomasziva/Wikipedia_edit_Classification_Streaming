From that year to 1912, all [[Revenue stamp|revenue issues]] were postage stamps [[overprint]]ed accordingly, that was either done locally or by [[De La Rue]] in [[London]]. Postage stamps also became [[Postage and revenue stamp|valid for fiscal use]] in 1913, so no new revenues were issued until 1926\u201330, when a series of [[key type stamp]]s depicting King [[George V]] were issued. These exist unappropriated for use as general-duty revenues, or with additional inscriptions indicating a specific use; Applications, Contracts, Registers or Stocks & Shares. The only other revenues after this series were [[Pound (currency)|\u00a3]]1 stamps depicting [[George VI]] and [[Elizabeth II]]. Postage stamps remained valid for fiscal use until at least the 1980s.\n\nMalta also used [[impressed duty stamp]]s from the 1920s until these were replaced by [[Impressed duty stamp#Pre-printed revenue stamps|pre-printed revenues]] in the 1970s. The latter were discontinued in the early 1990s. Malta also had specific stamps for Workmen's Compensation (1929\u201356), passport fees (1933\u201372), National Insurance (1956\u201378) and Airport Charge (1975\u201388). [[Excise stamp]]s have been used to pay the tax on cigarettes since the 1930s, the tax on spirits since the 2000s, and the tax on wine since 2015. Excise imprints were also used on cinema, theatre and football match tickets from around the 1950s to the 1980s.\n\n==General-duty revenues==\n[[File:1908 5s on 10s red revenue stamp of Malta.jpg|thumb|upright|The 5/- stamp of 1908, overprinted on a special printing of the 10/- stamp in red (the stamp had been originally issued as a 10/- postage stamp in black in 1899)<ref>{{cite book|title=Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Commonwealth and British Empire Stamps 1840\u20131970|date=2010|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|location=London|isbn=0852597312|pages=399\u2013400|edition=112}}</ref>]]\n\nMalta's first revenue stamps were issued on 9 August 1899, and this issue consisted of the \u00bd[[penny|d]], 1d, 4d, 1[[shilling|/-]] and 5/- values from the 1885\u201386 [[postage stamp|postage]] [[definitive stamp|definitive issue]] depicting [[Queen Victoria]] locally overprinted ''Revenue'' at the Government Printing Office in [[Valletta]].

From that year to 1941, Workmen's Compensation ({{lang-mt|Kumpens lill-\u0126addiem}}) stamps denominated 1d were issued with the colour being changed annually in order to prevent fraud (although some colours were reissued in different years). The issue for 1938\u201339 was locally overprinted with the years of validity. The law was revised in 1943, resulting in a change in procedure and the need for 2d stamps. Between 1943 and 1946, old stocks of postage stamps and earlier WCO stamps were issued with provisional surcharges. These were followed by a new issue between 1944 and 1956 in the same design as the previous stamps, but denominated 2d and once again in various colours.<ref name=\"msc\"/>\n\nThe WCO scheme was superseded by the National Insurance (NI) Act on 28 April 1956. Therefore, National Insurance ({{lang-mt|Sigurt\u00e0 Nazzjonali}}) stamps were required and old stocks of WCO issues were surcharged with new values. Between 1956 and 1966, a new set was issued, similar to the WCO types but with new inscriptions, values and colours. This issue incorporated a crown above the value, and after Malta achieved independence, a new design was issued omitting the crown. The latter series was issued between 1966 and 1971. Various provisional surcharges also exist on both sets. When the Maltese pound was adopted in 1972, new values were possibly issued but have never been recorded.

The design was printed in deep green, with the value in black. Reprints and additional values to this issue continued until 1967.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/><ref name=\"barefoot279\"/>\n\nA new design inscribed ''FEE PAID'' was issued in 1969, and these were printed in colours ranging from purple to brown, with the value in black.

Passport stamps were withdrawn upon the adoption of the [[Maltese lira]] in 1972.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/><ref name=\"barefoot279\"/>\n\n===Excise===\n====Cigarettes and alcohol====\nMalta has used [[excise stamp]]s to pay for the tax on cigarettes since at least the 1930s. Early issues consisted of long strips which depicted the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|British coat of arms]] and were inscribed ''EXCISE DUTY'' in English and ''DAZJU'' in Maltese. A smaller design was issued for imported cigarettes. Long strips with a plain design without any ornamentation were introduced in the 1950s, while designs depicting a mural crown and a Maltese cross were issued after independence in 1964.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\nIn 1972\u201373, smaller designs depicting the [[Coat of arms of Malta#Coat of Arms used between 1964 and 1975|post-independence coat of arms]] and denominated in the [[Maltese lira]] were issued. This design remained in use from the 1970s to the 1990s, with changes in the coats of arms in 1975 and 1988. A new series with a similar design but with the inscriptions altered to ''SISA'' in Maltese and ''EXCISE'' in English was introduced in around 1995. Specific types for imported cigarettes were also issued between the 1970s and the 1990s or 2000s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scicluna|first1=Joe|title=Malta Cigarette (Excise Duty) Revenue Labels|journal=Melita|date=Autumn 2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=8\u20139|publisher=Malta Study Circle}}</ref> In around 2005, stamps inscribed ''EXCISE DUTY PAID'' and printed on silver foil incorporating a security hologram were introduced, and these exist in two designs.

Issues to pay the tax on spirits are printed on silver foil, with designs similar to those used on cigarettes, and they exist inscribed either ''EXCISE DUTY PAID'' or ''MT EXCISE''.

From around 1953 to the late 1960s, the imprints were inscribed ''EXCISE REVENUE'' and had a crown in the centre, the design being based on the adhesive excise revenues used in the UK.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\nThis was replaced by a design inscribed ''INLAND REVENUE'' and depicting a mural crown in the early 1970s. After Malta became a republic in 1974, designs depicting the [[Coat of arms of Malta#Coat of Arms used between 1975 and 1988|new coat of arms]] were introduced, and they remained in use until at least 1985.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\n===Airport Charge===\nOn 1 July 1975, a Lm1 stamp depicting an [[Empennage|aeroplane tail]] and a [[Maltese cross]] was issued to pay the Airport Charge ({{lang-mt|\u0126las ta' l-Ajruport}}), a type of an [[airport improvement fee]].

[[Excise stamp]]s have been used to pay the tax on cigarettes since the 1930s, the tax on spirits since the 2000s, and the tax on wine since 2015.

Three decimal overprints are, however, known to exist.<ref name=\"msc\">{{cite book|last1=Grasham|first1=Donald|last2=Wood|first2=Hadrian|title=Malta Revenue Stamps of the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance and the National Insurance Scheme (1929\u20131974)|date=2011|publisher=Malta Study Circle|location=[[Surrey]]|isbn=9780956243522}}</ref> A new decimal design was introduced in around 1976.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/> National Insurance stamps were withdrawn in 1978, after which NI contributions were paid directly to the Inland Revenue Department.<ref>{{cite web |title=How much do you know about the history of Social Security in Malta? |url=https://socialsecurity.gov.mt/en/Legislation-Publications/Documents/History%20of%20Social%20Security%20SystemEN.pdf |publisher=Department of Social Security |date=2016 |accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Passport===\n[[File:1933-62 passport revenue stamps of Malta.jpg|thumb|Passport stamps issued between 1933 and 1962]]\n\nMalta's first passport stamps were issued in 1933, and they were inscribed ''FEE PAID'' and ''PASSPORT''. The design was printed in deep green, with the value in black. Reprints and additional values to this issue continued until 1967.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/><ref name=\"barefoot279\"/>\n\nA new design inscribed ''FEE PAID'' was issued in 1969, and these were printed in colours ranging from purple to brown, with the value in black. Only four values from this issue are known to exist, although it is likely that more values were issued. Passport stamps were withdrawn upon the adoption of the [[Maltese lira]] in 1972.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/><ref name=\"barefoot279\"/>\n\n===Excise===\n====Cigarettes and alcohol====\nMalta has used [[excise stamp]]s to pay for the tax on cigarettes since at least the 1930s. Early issues consisted of long strips which depicted the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|British coat of arms]] and were inscribed ''EXCISE DUTY'' in English and ''DAZJU'' in Maltese. A smaller design was issued for imported cigarettes. Long strips with a plain design without any ornamentation were introduced in the 1950s, while designs depicting a mural crown and a Maltese cross were issued after independence in 1964.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\nIn 1972\u201373, smaller designs depicting the [[Coat of arms of Malta#Coat of Arms used between 1964 and 1975|post-independence coat of arms]] and denominated in the [[Maltese lira]] were issued. This design remained in use from the 1970s to the 1990s, with changes in the coats of arms in 1975 and 1988. A new series with a similar design but with the inscriptions altered to ''SISA'' in Maltese and ''EXCISE'' in English was introduced in around 1995. Specific types for imported cigarettes were also issued between the 1970s and the 1990s or 2000s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scicluna|first1=Joe|title=Malta Cigarette (Excise Duty) Revenue Labels|journal=Melita|date=Autumn 2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=8\u20139|publisher=Malta Study Circle}}</ref> In around 2005, stamps inscribed ''EXCISE DUTY PAID'' and printed on silver foil incorporating a security hologram were introduced, and these exist in two designs. In 2017, similar stamps inscribed ''MT EXCISE'' were introduced.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\nExcise duty stamps to pay the tax on alcohol have been in use since around 2008. Issues to pay the tax on spirits are printed on silver foil, with designs similar to those used on cigarettes, and they exist inscribed either ''EXCISE DUTY PAID'' or ''MT EXCISE''. The excise duty on wine was introduced in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chetcuti|first1=Joseph|date=2015|title=Notice to all wine importers|url=https://customs.gov.mt/docs/default-source/important-notices-to-importers/notice-to-all-wine-importers.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=Department of Customs|publisher=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904151351/https://customs.gov.mt/docs/default-source/important-notices-to-importers/notice-to-all-wine-importers.pdf?sfvrsn=2|archivedate=4 September 2016}}</ref> and the first issue was inscribed ''EXCISE TAX STAMP'' and printed on gold foil. Later that year, paper strips and circular labels inscribed ''MT EXCISE'' were issued, and they are still in use as of 2017.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\n====Entertainment tax====\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, cinema, theatre and football match tickets had an excise imprint indicating that a form of [[entertainment tax]] had been paid. From around 1953 to the late 1960s, the imprints were inscribed ''EXCISE REVENUE'' and had a crown in the centre, the design being based on the adhesive excise revenues used in the UK.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\nThis was replaced by a design inscribed ''INLAND REVENUE'' and depicting a mural crown in the early 1970s. After Malta became a republic in 1974, designs depicting the [[Coat of arms of Malta#Coat of Arms used between 1975 and 1988|new coat of arms]] were introduced, and they remained in use until at least 1985.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/>\n\n===Airport Charge===\nOn 1 July 1975, a Lm1 stamp depicting an [[Empennage|aeroplane tail]] and a [[Maltese cross]] was issued to pay the Airport Charge ({{lang-mt|\u0126las ta' l-Ajruport}}), a type of an [[airport improvement fee]]. This stamp replaced a series of Passenger Service Charge labels which had been in use since the 1960s or earlier. A Lm2 value with an identical design was issued on 24 March 1988.<ref name=\"revrevd\"/><ref name=\"barefoot278\">{{harvnb|Barefoot|2012|p=278}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Postage stamps and postal history of Malta]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Barefoot|first1=John|title=British Commonwealth Revenues|date=2012|publisher=J.
