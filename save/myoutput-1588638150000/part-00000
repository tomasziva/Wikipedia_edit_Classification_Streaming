Murder necessarily required that an appreciable time pass between the formation and execution of the intent to kill. The courts broadened the scope of murder by eliminating the requirement of actual premeditation and deliberation as well as true malice. All that was required for malice aforethought to exist is that the perpetrator act with one of the four states of mind that constitutes \"malice\".\n\nThe four states of mind recognized as constituting \"malice\" are:<ref>Wise, Edward. \"Criminal Law\" in ''Introduction to the Law of the United States'' (Clark and Ansay, eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lpybMKdDoVIC&pg=PA154 154] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517093704/https://books.google.com/books?id=lpybMKdDoVIC&pg=PA154 |date=2015-05-17 }} (2002).</ref>\n\n{{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman\n|[[Intention (criminal law)|Intent to kill]],\n|Intent to inflict [[grievous bodily harm]] short of death,\n|Reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (sometimes described as an \"abandoned and malignant heart\"), or\n|Intent to commit a dangerous [[felony]] (the \"[[felony murder]]\" doctrine).\n}}\n\nUnder state of mind (i), intent to kill, the ''deadly weapon rule'' applies. Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a [[deadly weapon]] or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. In other words, \"[[transferred intent|intent follows the bullet]]\". Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims.\n\nUnder state of mind (iii), an \"abandoned and malignant heart\", the killing must result from the defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury. In Australian jurisdictions, the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death (or grievous bodily harm in most states), as opposed to possibility.<ref name=\"R v Crabbe\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1985|litigants=R v [[Douglas Crabbe|Crabbe]] |parallelcite=(1985) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 464 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=26 March 1985}}; but the common law has been modified in NSW: {{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1991|litigants=Royall v R |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 378 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=25 June 1991}}.</ref>\n\nUnder state of mind (iv), the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping. Importantly, the underlying felony ''cannot'' be a [[lesser included offense]] such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.\n\nIn Spanish criminal law, murder takes place when any of these requirements concur: Treachery (the use of means to avoid risk for the aggressor or to ensure that the crime goes unpunished), price or reward (financial gain) or viciousness (deliberately increasing the pain of the victim). After the last reform of the Spanish Criminal Code, in force since July 1, 2015, another circumstance that turns homicide into murder is the desire to facilitate the commission of another crime or to prevent it from being discovered.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/549720-lo-1-2015-de-30-mar-modifica-la-lo-10-1995-de-23-nov-del-codigo-penal.html |title=Ley Org\u00e1nica 1/2015, de 30 de marzo, por la que se modifica la Ley Org\u00e1nica 10/1995, de 23 de noviembre, del C\u00f3digo Penal|website=Noticias Jur\u00eddicas|access-date=|language = Spanish}}</ref>\n\nAs with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation. Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offense. The jury might sympathize with the defendant (e.g. in a [[crime of passion]], or in the case of a bullied victim who kills their tormentor), and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.\n\n===Degrees of murder===\n{{Redirect|Murder in the second degree|the 2016 album|Murder in the Second Degree}}\n{{redirect|Premeditated murder|the 1995 Serbian film|Premeditated Murder}}\nMany jurisdictions divide murder by degrees. The distinction between first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in [[Murder (Canadian law)|Canadian murder law]] and [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|U.S. murder law]].\n\nThe most common division is between first- and second-degree murder. Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form. The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation. In some, murder committed by acts such as [[strangulation]], [[poisoning]], or [[lying in wait]] are also treated as first-degree murder.<ref>Murder in the First and Second Degree (14\u201317)\nA murder which shall be perpetrated by ... poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape or sex offense, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony committed or attempted with the use of a deadly weapon, shall be ... murder in the first degree ... and shall be punished by death or life imprisonment ... except that any person ... under 17 years of age at the time of the murder shall be punished with imprisonment ... for life.\nAll other kinds of murder, including that which shall be proximately caused by the unlawful distribution of opium or any synthetic or natural salt, compound, derivative, or the preparation of opium ... cause the death of the user, shall be ... murder in the second degree and ... shall be punished as a Class C felony\n</ref> A few states in the U.S. further distinguish [[third-degree murder]], but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second-degree versus third-degree. For example, Minnesota defines third-degree murder as [[depraved-heart murder]], whereas Florida defines third-degree murder as [[felony murder]] (except when the underlying felony is specifically listed in the definition of first-degree murder).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=flr|first=Frank|last=Brenner|title=The Impulsive Murder and the Degree Device|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=22|issue=3|year=1953|access-date=2018-03-13|ref=harv|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214239/https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=flr|archivedate=2018-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|title=Minnesota Second-Degree Murder|website=findlaw.com|access-date=2018-03-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314043759/http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|archivedate=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\nSome jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder. This is the [[crime]] of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another [[human]] being (also known as murder) after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so, in order to either increase the likelihood of success, or to evade detection or apprehension.<ref>{{cite web|title=Premeditation|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910082842/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> [[U.S. state|State]] laws in the [[United States]] vary as to definitions of \"premeditation\". In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder. Premeditated murder is one of the most serious forms of [[homicide]], and is punished more severely than [[manslaughter]] or other types of homicide, often with a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]], or in some countries, the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]. In the U.S, [[United States federal law|federal law]] ({{USCSub|18|1111|a}}) criminalizes premeditated murder, felony murder and second-degree murder committed under situations where federal jurisdiction applies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Title 18 USC, Sec. 1111, Murder|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910040431/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] classifies [[Murder (Canadian law)|murder]] as either 1st- or 2nd-degree. The former type of murder is often called premeditated murder, although premeditation is not the only way murder can be classified as first-degree.\n\n===Common law===\nAccording to Blackstone, English [[common law]] identified murder as a ''public wrong''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |title=Blackstone, Book 4, Chapter 14 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203082805/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 }}</ref> According to common law, murder is considered to be ''[[malum in se]]'', that is an act which is evil within itself. An act such as murder is wrong or evil by its very nature. And it is the very nature of the act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime.<ref>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage By Bryan A. Garner, p. 545.</ref>\n\nSome jurisdictions still take a [[common law]] view of murder. In such jurisdictions, what is considered to be murder is defined by [[precedent]] case law or previous decisions of the courts of law. However, although the common law is by nature flexible and adaptable, in the interests both of certainty and of securing convictions, most common law jurisdictions have [[Codification (law)|codified]] their criminal law and now have statutory definitions of murder.\n\n===Exclusions===\n\n====General====\nAlthough laws vary by country, there are circumstances of exclusion that are common in many legal systems.\n* Killing of enemy combatants who have not surrendered by lawful combatants, in accordance with lawful orders in war, is generally not considered murder.  Illicit killings within a war may constitute murder or homicidal [[war crime]]s; see [[Laws of war]]\n* [[Right of self-defense|Self-defense]]: acting in self-defense or in defense of another person is generally accepted as legal justification for killing a person in situations that would otherwise have been murder. However, a self-defense killing might be considered manslaughter if the killer established control of the situation before the killing took place. In the case of self-defense, it is called a \"justifiable homicide\".<ref name=\"crim liability\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&dateTexte=|title=Article 122-5|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|language=fr|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408162844/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&dateTexte=|archivedate=2008-04-08}}</ref>\n* Unlawful killings without malice or intent are considered [[manslaughter]].\n* In many common law countries, [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] is a partial defense to a charge of murder which acts by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter (this is voluntary manslaughter, which is more severe than involuntary manslaughter).\n* Accidental killings are considered [[homicide]]s.

Using properly filtered data, it is possible to make the case for or against either of these issues. For example, one could look at murder rates in the United States from 1950 to 2000,<ref>{{cite web |author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=Disaster Center web site |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701112104/http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref> and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a [[capital punishment in the United States|moratorium on death sentences]] was effectively imposed in the late 1960s. This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and, as such, it is morally justified. Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher murder rates than [[Canada]] and most [[European Union]] countries, although all those countries have abolished the death penalty. Overall, the global pattern is [[chaos theory|too complex]], and on average, the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social, economic, and cultural.\n\nDespite the immense improvements in [[forensics]] in the past few decades, the fraction of murders solved has decreased in the United States, from 90% in 1960 to 61% in 2007.<ref name=\"mccune\">{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Why Fewer Murder Cases Get Solved These Days|url=https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|accessdate=10 September 2017|agency=PacificStandard|date=20 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910125159/https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> Solved murder rates in major U.S. cities varied in 2007 from 36% in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to 76% in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]].<ref name=\"monitor\">{{cite news|last1=Whitley|first1=Brian|title=Why fewer murder cases get solved|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|accessdate=10 September 2017|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084042/https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> Major factors affecting the arrest rate include witness cooperation<ref name=\"mccune\" /> and the number of people assigned to investigate the case.<ref name=\"monitor\" />\n\n===History of murder rates===\n[[File:Homicide-world.png|250px|thumb|Intentional homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants, 2009]]\nAccording to scholar Pieter Spierenburg [[homicide rates]] per 100,000 in [[Europe]] have fallen over the centuries, from 35 per 100,000 in medieval times, to 20 in 1500&nbsp;AD, 5 in 1700, to below two per 100,000 in 1900.<ref name=\"Spierenburg\">Spierenburg, Pieter, ''A History of Murder: Personal Violence in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present'', Polity, 2008.

Much of the raise in the U.S. murder rate during the first half of the 20th century is generally thought to be attributed to gang violence associated with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Since most murders are committed by young males, the near simultaneous low in the murder rates of major developed countries circa 1960 can be attributed to low birth rates during the Great Depression and World War II. Causes of further moves are more controversial. Some of the more exotic factors claimed to affect murder rates include the availability of abortion<ref>\"Freakonomics\", Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner, 2005, {{ISBN|0-06-073132-X}}</ref> and the likelihood of chronic exposure to [[lead poisoning#Nervous system|lead]] during childhood (due to the use of leaded paint in houses and [[tetraethyllead]] as a gasoline additive in internal combustion engines).<ref>{{cite web\n|url         = https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health/\n|title       = Lead: America's Real Criminal Element\n|last        = Drum\n|first       = Kevin\n|date        = 2016-02-11\n|website     = Mother Jones\n|access-date = 2017-08-14\n|url-status     = live\n|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170811141759/https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health/\n|archivedate = 2017-08-11\n}}</ref><!-- See the article on lead poisoning for citations.-->\n{{clear}}\n\n==Investigation==\n\nThe success rate of [[criminal investigation]]s into murders (the [[clearance rate]]) tends to be relatively high for murder compared to other crimes, due to its seriousness.

The courts broadened the scope of murder by eliminating the requirement of actual premeditation and deliberation as well as true malice.

Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a [[deadly weapon]] or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. In other words, \"[[transferred intent|intent follows the bullet]]\". Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims.\n\nUnder state of mind (iii), an \"abandoned and malignant heart\", the killing must result from the defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury. In Australian jurisdictions, the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death (or grievous bodily harm in most states), as opposed to possibility.<ref name=\"R v Crabbe\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1985|litigants=R v [[Douglas Crabbe|Crabbe]] |parallelcite=(1985) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 464 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=26 March 1985}}; but the common law has been modified in NSW: {{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1991|litigants=Royall v R |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 378 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=25 June 1991}}.</ref>\n\nUnder state of mind (iv), the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping. Importantly, the underlying felony ''cannot'' be a [[lesser included offense]] such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.\n\nIn Spanish criminal law, murder takes place when any of these requirements concur: Treachery (the use of means to avoid risk for the aggressor or to ensure that the crime goes unpunished), price or reward (financial gain) or viciousness (deliberately increasing the pain of the victim). After the last reform of the Spanish Criminal Code, in force since July 1, 2015, another circumstance that turns homicide into murder is the desire to facilitate the commission of another crime or to prevent it from being discovered.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/549720-lo-1-2015-de-30-mar-modifica-la-lo-10-1995-de-23-nov-del-codigo-penal.html |title=Ley Org\u00e1nica 1/2015, de 30 de marzo, por la que se modifica la Ley Org\u00e1nica 10/1995, de 23 de noviembre, del C\u00f3digo Penal|website=Noticias Jur\u00eddicas|access-date=|language = Spanish}}</ref>\n\nAs with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation. Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offense. The jury might sympathize with the defendant (e.g. in a [[crime of passion]], or in the case of a bullied victim who kills their tormentor), and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.\n\n===Degrees of murder===\n{{Redirect|Murder in the second degree|the 2016 album|Murder in the Second Degree}}\n{{redirect|Premeditated murder|the 1995 Serbian film|Premeditated Murder}}\nMany jurisdictions divide murder by degrees. The distinction between first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in [[Murder (Canadian law)|Canadian murder law]] and [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|U.S. murder law]].\n\nThe most common division is between first- and second-degree murder. Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form. The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation. In some, murder committed by acts such as [[strangulation]], [[poisoning]], or [[lying in wait]] are also treated as first-degree murder.<ref>Murder in the First and Second Degree (14\u201317)\nA murder which shall be perpetrated by ... poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape or sex offense, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony committed or attempted with the use of a deadly weapon, shall be ... murder in the first degree ... and shall be punished by death or life imprisonment ... except that any person ... under 17 years of age at the time of the murder shall be punished with imprisonment ... for life.\nAll other kinds of murder, including that which shall be proximately caused by the unlawful distribution of opium or any synthetic or natural salt, compound, derivative, or the preparation of opium ... cause the death of the user, shall be ... murder in the second degree and ... shall be punished as a Class C felony\n</ref> A few states in the U.S. further distinguish [[third-degree murder]], but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second-degree versus third-degree. For example, Minnesota defines third-degree murder as [[depraved-heart murder]], whereas Florida defines third-degree murder as [[felony murder]] (except when the underlying felony is specifically listed in the definition of first-degree murder).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=flr|first=Frank|last=Brenner|title=The Impulsive Murder and the Degree Device|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=22|issue=3|year=1953|access-date=2018-03-13|ref=harv|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214239/https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=flr|archivedate=2018-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|title=Minnesota Second-Degree Murder|website=findlaw.com|access-date=2018-03-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314043759/http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|archivedate=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\nSome jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder. This is the [[crime]] of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another [[human]] being (also known as murder) after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so, in order to either increase the likelihood of success, or to evade detection or apprehension.<ref>{{cite web|title=Premeditation|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910082842/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> [[U.S. state|State]] laws in the [[United States]] vary as to definitions of \"premeditation\". In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder. Premeditated murder is one of the most serious forms of [[homicide]], and is punished more severely than [[manslaughter]] or other types of homicide, often with a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]], or in some countries, the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]. In the U.S, [[United States federal law|federal law]] ({{USCSub|18|1111|a}}) criminalizes premeditated murder, felony murder and second-degree murder committed under situations where federal jurisdiction applies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Title 18 USC, Sec. 1111, Murder|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910040431/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] classifies [[Murder (Canadian law)|murder]] as either 1st- or 2nd-degree. The former type of murder is often called premeditated murder, although premeditation is not the only way murder can be classified as first-degree.\n\n===Common law===\nAccording to Blackstone, English [[common law]] identified murder as a ''public wrong''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |title=Blackstone, Book 4, Chapter 14 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203082805/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 }}</ref> According to common law, murder is considered to be ''[[malum in se]]'', that is an act which is evil within itself. An act such as murder is wrong or evil by its very nature. And it is the very nature of the act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime.<ref>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage By Bryan A. Garner, p. 545.</ref>\n\nSome jurisdictions still take a [[common law]] view of murder. In such jurisdictions, what is considered to be murder is defined by [[precedent]] case law or previous decisions of the courts of law. However, although the common law is by nature flexible and adaptable, in the interests both of certainty and of securing convictions, most common law jurisdictions have [[Codification (law)|codified]] their criminal law and now have statutory definitions of murder.\n\n===Exclusions===\n\n====General====\nAlthough laws vary by country, there are circumstances of exclusion that are common in many legal systems.\n* Killing of enemy combatants who have not surrendered by lawful combatants, in accordance with lawful orders in war, is generally not considered murder.  Illicit killings within a war may constitute murder or homicidal [[war crime]]s; see [[Laws of war]]\n* [[Right of self-defense|Self-defense]]: acting in self-defense or in defense of another person is generally accepted as legal justification for killing a person in situations that would otherwise have been murder. However, a self-defense killing might be considered manslaughter if the killer established control of the situation before the killing took place. In the case of self-defense, it is called a \"justifiable homicide\".<ref name=\"crim liability\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&dateTexte=|title=Article 122-5|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|language=fr|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408162844/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&dateTexte=|archivedate=2008-04-08}}</ref>\n* Unlawful killings without malice or intent are considered [[manslaughter]].\n* In many common law countries, [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] is a partial defense to a charge of murder which acts by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter (this is voluntary manslaughter, which is more severe than involuntary manslaughter).\n* Accidental killings are considered [[homicide]]s.

Using properly filtered data, it is possible to make the case for or against either of these issues. For example, one could look at murder rates in the United States from 1950 to 2000,<ref>{{cite web |author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=Disaster Center web site |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701112104/http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref> and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a [[capital punishment in the United States|moratorium on death sentences]] was effectively imposed in the late 1960s. This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and, as such, it is morally justified. Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher murder rates than [[Canada]] and most [[European Union]] countries, although all those countries have abolished the death penalty. Overall, the global pattern is [[chaos theory|too complex]], and on average, the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social, economic, and cultural.\n\nDespite the immense improvements in [[forensics]] in the past few decades, the fraction of murders solved has decreased in the United States, from 90% in 1960 to 61% in 2007.<ref name=\"mccune\">{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Why Fewer Murder Cases Get Solved These Days|url=https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|accessdate=10 September 2017|agency=PacificStandard|date=20 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910125159/https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> Solved murder rates in major U.S. cities varied in 2007 from 36% in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to 76% in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]].<ref name=\"monitor\">{{cite news|last1=Whitley|first1=Brian|title=Why fewer murder cases get solved|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|accessdate=10 September 2017|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084042/https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|archivedate=10 September 2017}}</ref> Major factors affecting the arrest rate include witness cooperation<ref name=\"mccune\" /> and the number of people assigned to investigate the case.<ref name=\"monitor\" />\n\n===History of murder rates===\n[[File:Homicide-world.png|250px|thumb|Intentional homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants, 2009]]\nAccording to scholar Pieter Spierenburg [[homicide rates]] per 100,000 in [[Europe]] have fallen over the centuries, from 35 per 100,000 in medieval times, to 20 in 1500&nbsp;AD, 5 in 1700, to below two per 100,000 in 1900.<ref name=\"Spierenburg\">Spierenburg, Pieter, ''A History of Murder: Personal Violence in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present'', Polity, 2008.

Much of the raise in the U.S. murder rate during the first half of the 20th century is generally thought to be attributed to gang violence associated with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Since most murders are committed by young males, the near simultaneous low in the murder rates of major developed countries circa 1960 can be attributed to low birth rates during the Great Depression and World War II. Causes of further moves are more controversial. Some of the more exotic factors claimed to affect murder rates include the availability of abortion<ref>\"Freakonomics\", Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner, 2005, {{ISBN|0-06-073132-X}}</ref> and the likelihood of chronic exposure to [[lead poisoning#Nervous system|lead]] during childhood (due to the use of leaded paint in houses and [[tetraethyllead]] as a gasoline additive in internal combustion engines).<ref>{{cite web\n|url         = https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health/\n|title       = Lead: America's Real Criminal Element\n|last        = Drum\n|first       = Kevin\n|date        = 2016-02-11\n|website     = Mother Jones\n|access-date = 2017-08-14\n|url-status     = live\n|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170811141759/https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health/\n|archivedate = 2017-08-11\n}}</ref><!-- See the article on lead poisoning for citations.-->\n{{clear}}\n\n==Investigation==\n\nThe success rate of [[criminal investigation]]s into murders (the [[clearance rate]]) tends to be relatively high for murder compared to other crimes, due to its seriousness.
