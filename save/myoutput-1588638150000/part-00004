Jai Singh succeddes in winning 33 forts from Shivaji. Then, the Mughal general Beshak Khan orders a quick vacation of the strategic fortess Kondhana, insulting [[Jijabai]], who swears to remain barefoot until the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] recapture Kondhana. Tanhaji too is informed about the treaty. 5 years later, Shivaji's spy informs him about Aurangzeb's plan to incharge the [[Sinhagad|Kondhana fort]] to the Rajput general Udaybhan Rathod and base it for Aurangzeb's southern imperial expansion. Shivaji plans to recapture Kondhana, considering himself to lead the campaign as Tanhaji, though an able general, can't be emoloyed due to his personal issue. Meanwhile, Tanhaji celebrates Holi with his family. Marathas begin their war preparations and Shivaji warns his generals to keep Tanhaji from knowing about the campaign, who arrives at [[Rajgad Fort|Rajgad]] for inviting Shivaji to Rayba's wedding. Chandraji Pisal, a Maratha general, reveals Tanhaji about the secret plan by his nephew Chultya's recommendation, who postponds Rayba's wedding to lead the campaign.\n\nElsewhere, Udaybhan reaches [[Burhanpur]] while the Marathas discuss his route possibilities. Tanhaji coins an attack plan but Pisal sends Chultya to warn Udaybhan about this, who has captured Kamla Devi, the sister of Udaybhan's Rajput general Jagat Singh. Chultya informs Udaybhan about Tanhaji's attack plan and he tricks Tanhaji into attacking Maratha soldiers. Dejected, Tanhaji reaches Kondhana alone to learn about a secret theif-enterence to the fort. Udaybhan successfully reaches Kondhana and aims a huge cannon at Rajgad. A guard is punished for disobeying the protocol and Tanhaji encourages the villagers to fight the invaders. He then participates in a [[Maha Shivaratri|Shivratri]] event on Kondhana where he kills Chultya for betreyal. Tanhaji is captured and tortured by Udaybhan, who imprisons him. Jagat Singh secretly releases Tanhaji, revealing Udaybhan's plan to marry his sister. Tanhaji promises to release them from Udaybhan's clutches. Tanhaji escapes from the theif-enterence and returns to Umrat.\n\nUdaybhan hangs the guards respnsible for Tanhaji's escape and Jagat Singh agrees to marry his sister to Udaybhan on Ashtami's eve, thus convincing her to fake the marriage preparation until Tanhaji arrives. Tanhaji now plans to directly attack Kondhana during Ashtami night on February 4, 1670. He scales the fort through various enterences and attacks the Mughal army. Udaybhan is alerted and an ensuing battle leads in Tanhaji's death, although he successfully captures Kondhana, thus killing Udaybhan. Shivaji arrives at Kondhana and praises a visibly dying Tanhaji for his heroic act. There, he says the famous dialogue, \"Gad Aala Pan Sinha Gela\" ( meaning- I won the fort, but lost my Lion). Shivaji himself conducts Rayba's marriage while Aurangzeb's dream of winning [[South India|Southern India]] remains unfilled. The film ends with Savitribai fullfilling her promise of grandly welcoming Tanhaji from his return.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as [[Tanaji Malusare]]\u2013 Parvati and Kaloji's son, Suryaji's brother, Shivaji's military leader and friend, Savitri's husband, Raiba's father\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as [[Uday Bhan|Udaybhan Singh Rathore]]\u2013 Aurangzeb's royal guard\n* [[Kajol]] as Savitri Bai Malusare\u2013 Tanaji's wife, Raiba's mother\n* [[Sharad Kelkar]] as [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]\u2013 Jija Bai and Shahaji's son, Tanaji's friend\n* [[Luke Kenny]] as [[Aurangzeb]]\u2013 [[Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]]\n* [[Vipul Gupta]] as Jagat Singh\u2013 Kamla's brother\n* Padmavati Rao as [[Jijabai|Rajmata Jija Bai]]\u2013 Shahaji's wife, Shivaji's mother \n* [[Shashank Shende]] as Shelaar\u2013 Parvati's brother, Tanaji and Suryaji's uncle\n* [[Devdatta Nage]] as Suryaji Malusare\u2013 Parvati and Kaloji's son, Tanaji's brother, Raiba's uncle\n* [[Neha Sharma]] as Kamla Devi\u2013 Jagat's sister, Uday Bhan's love interest\n* [[Ajinkya Deo]] as Chandraji Pisal\n* Yuri Suri as [[Jai Singh I|Mirza Raje Jai Singh]]\n* Jagannath Nivangune as Kaloji Malusare\u2013 Parvati's husband, Tanaji and Suryaji's father, Raiba's grandfather\n* Trisha Patil as Parvati Bai Malusare\u2013 Shelaar's sister, Kaloji's wife, Tanaji and Suryaji's mother, Raiba's grandmother\n* Hardik Sangani as Gondya\n* [[Nissar Khan]] as Beshak Khan\n* Prasanna Ketkar as Sarnaik\n* Kailash Waghmare as Chultiya\n* Harsh Sharma as Young Tanaji\n* Ranav Sharma as Young Suryaji\n* Arush Nand as Raiba Malusare\u2013 Savitri and Tanaji's son\n* Dhairyasheel Gholap as Shrubhau\n* Nilesh Lalwani as Tatya\n* Pramod More as Leader of Gondia\n* Bhagyashree Nhalve as Suryaji's wife\n* Devendra Gaikwad as Raiba's father-in-law\n* Rajesh Ahir as Raha Sangram Singh\n* Angad Mhaskar as Pant\n* Nikhat Khan as Udaybhan's mom\n* Antima Sharma as Nafeesa\n* Niranjan Jadhao as Trimbak Rao\n* Elakshi More as Soryabhi\n* Shivraj Walvekar as Pratap Rao\n* [[Rajveer Singh]] as Khaibar Khan\n* Ramchandran Singh as Raja Kaka\n* Maira Dandekar as Raiba's wife\n* Tufali Khan as Munawar Khan\n* Mridul Kumar as Noor Khan Baig\n* Sandeep Juwatkar as Gujar\n* Ajay Kumar Nain as Rajput Vakil\n* Nitesh Kalbande as Divya Malusare\n* Tareeq Ahmed Khan as Soldier\n\n== Production ==\n[[Pre-production]] began on 20 July 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/ajay-devgn-reveals-first-look-of-taanaji-the-unsung-warrior/story-JLG1bg6gPEWhTGhRZ0PIuJ.html|title=Ajay Devgn reveals first look of Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior|date=2017-07-20|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] commenced from 25 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/TSeries/status/1044483007912992769/|title=TSeries on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Marketing and release ==\nEarlier marketed as ''Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior'', it was revealed on Twitter by [[Ajay Devgn]] that the film will be known as ''Tanhaji''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In December 2017, the release date of ''Tanhaji'' was revealed as 22 November 2019 but was postponed to December 2019 due to shooting problems.

Jai Singh succeddes in winning 33 forts from Shivaji. Then, the Mughal general Beshak Khan orders a quick vacation of the strategic fortess Kondhana, insulting [[Jijabai]], who swears to remain barefoot until the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] recapture Kondhana. Tanhaji too is informed about the treaty. 5 years later, Shivaji's spy informs him about Aurangzeb's plan to incharge the [[Sinhagad|Kondhana fort]] to the Rajput general Udaybhan Rathod and base it for Aurangzeb's southern imperial expansion. Shivaji plans to recapture Kondhana, considering himself to lead the campaign as Tanhaji, though an able general, can't be emoloyed due to his personal issue. Meanwhile, Tanhaji celebrates Holi with his family. Marathas begin their war preparations and Shivaji warns his generals to keep Tanhaji from knowing about the campaign, who arrives at [[Rajgad Fort|Rajgad]] for inviting Shivaji to Rayba's wedding. Chandraji Pisal, a Maratha general, reveals Tanhaji about the secret plan by his nephew Chultya's recommendation, who postponds Rayba's wedding to lead the campaign.\n\nElsewhere, Udaybhan reaches [[Burhanpur]] while the Marathas discuss his route possibilities. Tanhaji coins an attack plan but Pisal sends Chultya to warn Udaybhan about this, who has captured Kamla Devi, the sister of Udaybhan's Rajput general Jagat Singh. Chultya informs Udaybhan about Tanhaji's attack plan and he tricks Tanhaji into attacking Maratha soldiers. Dejected, Tanhaji reaches Kondhana alone to learn about a secret theif-enterence to the fort. Udaybhan successfully reaches Kondhana and aims a huge cannon at Rajgad. A guard is punished for disobeying the protocol and Tanhaji encourages the villagers to fight the invaders. He then participates in a [[Maha Shivaratri|Shivratri]] event on Kondhana where he kills Chultya for betreyal. Tanhaji is captured and tortured by Udaybhan, who imprisons him. Jagat Singh secretly releases Tanhaji, revealing Udaybhan's plan to marry his sister. Tanhaji promises to release them from Udaybhan's clutches. Tanhaji escapes from the theif-enterence and returns to Umrat.\n\nUdaybhan hangs the guards respnsible for Tanhaji's escape and Jagat Singh agrees to marry his sister to Udaybhan on Ashtami's eve, thus convincing her to fake the marriage preparation until Tanhaji arrives. Tanhaji now plans to directly attack Kondhana during Ashtami night on February 4, 1670. He scales the fort through various enterences and attacks the Mughal army. Udaybhan is alerted and an ensuing battle leads in Tanhaji's death, although he successfully captures Kondhana, thus killing Udaybhan. Shivaji arrives at Kondhana and praises a visibly dying Tanhaji for his heroic act. There, he says the famous dialogue, \"Gad Aala Pan Sinha Gela\" ( meaning- I won the fort, but lost my Lion). Shivaji himself conducts Rayba's marriage while Aurangzeb's dream of winning [[South India|Southern India]] remains unfilled.
