Police believed at the time that the letters could quite likely have been authentic after comparing them with others written by Jane. The letter from \"The Man\" said that he had appointed himself \"guardian\" of the children and was willing to hand them back to their parents.

Shortly afterwards a man identified as Tony Munro arrived in an upset manner and had a private conversation with Max which caused both to panic. Munro left and returned an hour later and Max showed Ruth the bodies of the 3 kids in the trunk of his car telling her they had died before Munro could get them to hospital after a children's game gone wrong. A day or so later following media reports, Max admitted to Ruth he was the man the kids had been playing with on the beach. She claims the bodies were dumped in a nearby dam temporarily by Max then later buried in a well on their family property 200km away and she seeks the well excavated (this is also corroborated by her half sister Rachael Vaughan) <ref> {url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbRuBco63-Y}</ref>. Her older brother Andrew McIntyre confirms this story <ref> {url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgeAqm-ERKg}</ref>. SA Police have not acted on this lead and she has a online petition running to have the site excavated.

Various witness have also stated Phipps had a cottage at the rear of the factory near the sand pit which was out of bounds to all staff where his son alleged Phipps engaged in secret activities. However no proof exists against Phipps in this matter.\n\nThe McIntyre children allegations are consistent with a story in New Idea Magazine on 28 Feb 2018 wherein a new witness alleged he saw the Beaumont children with 3 adults (2 men & a woman), the men possibly fitting the description of McIntyre Snr & Munro, around 1.30pm that day near Phipps house <ref> {url=https://www.newidea.com.au/beaumont-children-witness-comes-forward}</ref>.

Another important distinction is that von Einem was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old and suspected of killing men in their teens and twenties; victims older than the Beaumont children and the children who were abducted from the [[Adelaide Oval]]. Such disparities amongst victims of a [[serial killer]] are not unheard of, but unusual.<ref name=\"O'Brien2002\"/>\n\nThe reference to surgical experimentation von Einem had purportedly made to Mr B also corresponded to the [[coroner]]'s reports on several of the murdered youths.

They disappeared while on their way to school on 26 August 1970 and their bodies were found several days later in a dry creek bed. Both girls had been strangled. Brown's July 2000 trial was delayed after his lawyer applied for a section 613 verdict (unfit to be tried) from the jury. He was never retried as he was found to have [[dementia]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Brown died in 2002.\n\nAlong with von Einem, Brown is considered to be the most likely suspect for the Beaumont abduction as he bore a striking similarity to an [[Facial composite|identikit]] picture of the suspect for both the Beaumont and Adelaide Oval cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/suspected-mass-child-killer-is-buried-with-his-secrets-at-90-20020722-gduf0t.html|title=Suspected mass child killer is buried with his secrets at 90|date=22 July 2002|website=The Age}}</ref> A search for a connection to the Beaumonts was unsuccessful as no employment records existed that could shed light on his movements at the time. Some of the records were believed lost in the [[1974 Brisbane flood]]. It is also possible that Brown, who had unrestricted access to government buildings, may have deleted his own files.\n\nAlthough there is no proof that he had ever visited Adelaide, a witness recalled having a conversation with Brown in which he mentioned having seen the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] nearing completion, which places him in the city in June 1973. The Oval abduction occurred on 25 August 1973. However, no evidence has ever been found to connect Brown with Adelaide in 1966, when the Beaumont children were abducted.<ref name=\"cccnews.info\"/> Another witness, who reported seeing a man<ref>The suspect in both crimes wore a distinctive wide-brimmed hat with a low, flat crown. Rare in Adelaide, the hat was common in the north of Australia.</ref> near the Oval carrying a young girl while another older girl in distress followed, later identified Brown as the man she had seen after seeing his picture on television in December 1998 in relation to the MacKay murders.

Additionally, she had reported that the man was wearing a pair of [[horn rimmed glasses]], a pair of which Brown is known to have worn, something considered by police to be another noteworthy point in the identification. Brown was 53 at the time of the Beaumont disappearance, which may or may not match the description of the suspect seen with the children, who was reported as being in his late thirties.\n\n===James Ryan O'Neill===\n{{Main|James Ryan O'Neill}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, James O'Neill, who was jailed for life in 1975 for the murder of a 9-year-old boy in [[Tasmania]], had told a station owner in the Kimberley and several other acquaintances that he was responsible for the disappearance of the Beaumont children. In 2006, O'Neill lost an injunction in the [[High Court of Australia]] to stop the broadcast of a documentary ''The Fishermen'' which attempted to link him to the Beaumont case. The documentary aired on 26 October 2006 on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lower|first1=Gavin|title=Ban on O'Neill screening quashed|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/ban-on-oneill-screening-quashed/story-e6frfkp9-1111112285777|accessdate=10 July 2014| work=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|date=29 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Convicted killer's lawyer rejects Beaumont children allegations| url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-09-28/convicted-killers-lawyer-rejects-beaumont-children/1273956|accessdate=10 July 2014| work=ABC News|date=28 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nFormer Victorian detective Gordon Davie spent three years speaking to O'Neill to win his confidence before filming him for the documentary. Davie said that although there was no evidence to link O'Neill to the disappearance, he was persuaded that O'Neill was to blame. \"I asked him about the Beaumonts and he said: 'I couldn't have done it. I was in [[Melbourne]] at that time.' That is not a denial.\" Later asked again if he had murdered the children, he replied, \"Look, on legal advice I am not going to say where I was or when I was there.\" Although O'Neill claims never to have visited Adelaide, his work in the opal industry at the time required that he frequently visit [[Coober Pedy]], which would have required him to pass through Adelaide.

He was identified as Neil Muir (25). His body was badly mutilated. In 1982, the mutilated body of Mark Langley (18) was found. Before his death, he had been subjected to \"surgery\" &mdash; his abdomen had been sliced open, and had been [[shaved]] prior to this. Part of his bowel had been removed and Langley had died from loss of blood. Over the next few months more bodies were found. The dismembered skeletal remains of Peter Stogneff (14) were found almost a year after his disappearance and Alan Barnes (18) was found mutilated in a similar manner to Langley. A fifth victim, Richard Kelvin (15), was found in 1983, once again with the same mutilations. Bevan Spencer von Einem was convicted of Kelvin's murder in 1984 and was charged with the murders of Barnes and Langley in 1989. However, the prosecution was forced to enter a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' (unwilling to pursue) when crucial evidence was deemed inadmissible. These crimes have been known collectively as the Family Murders; police believe that a core group of four people and up to eight associates were involved in the murders. Testimony given during von Einem's trial alleged he was involved in both the Beaumont children disappearance and the abduction of Ratcliffe and Gordon.<ref name=\"MysteryOver\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Beaumont case resulted in one of the largest police investigations in Australian criminal history and remains one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, even after many decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2016/01/20/expert-says-beaumont-children-died-in-1966.html|title=Expert says Beaumont children died in 1966|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=28 January 2016|publisher=[[Sky News Australia|Sky News]]}}</ref> In January 2018, the [[Premier of South Australia]], [[Jay Weatherill]], said that [[South Australia Police]] had \"never given up on the case\" and that they \"have a policy that no murder investigation ends up in a closed file\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-23/development-beaumont-children-case-best-lead-ever/9351666|title='Best lead there's ever been': Hopes raised in Beaumont children case|date=23 January 2018|work=ABC News|access-date=14 February 2018|language=en-AU}}</ref> The State Government also continues to maintain a $1 million reward for information relating to the children's disappearance.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe kidnapping is also viewed by many [[social commentator]]s as a significant event in the evolution of Australian society, with a large number of people changing the way they supervised their children daily.<ref name=\"Lifestyle2\"/><ref name=\"AndrewRule2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/true-crime-scene/andrew-rule-takes-a-hard-look-at-the-beaumont-children-murder-mystery/news-story/0d415a3e86a6701134046a9bb65151e1|title=Andrew Rule takes a hard look at 'The Beaumont Children' murder mystery|last1=Rule|first1=Andrew|date=24 January 2016|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> At the time, it was never publicly suggested that the children should not have been allowed to travel unsupervised, or that their parents were in any way negligent, simply because contemporary Australian society took it for granted that this was safe and acceptable.<ref name=\"ND2018\">{{cite news|url=https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/state/sa/2018/01/22/new-search-beaumont-children/|title=Police to conduct new search for Beaumont children at factory site|last=Elder|first=John|date=22 January 2018|newspaper=The New Daily|accessdate=23 January 2018|quote=I was Arnna's age, 7, when they vanished.

Shortly afterwards a man identified as Tony Munro arrived in an upset manner and had a private conversation with Max which caused both to panic. Munro left and returned an hour later and Max showed Ruth the bodies of the 3 kids in the trunk of his car telling her they had died before Munro could get them to hospital after a children's game gone wrong. A day or so later following media reports, Max admitted to Ruth he was the man the kids had been playing with on the beach. She claims the bodies were dumped in a nearby dam temporarily by Max then later buried in a well on their family property 200km away and she seeks the well excavated <ref> {url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbRuBco63-Y}</ref>. Her older brother Andrew McIntyre confirms this story <ref> {url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgeAqm-ERKg}</ref>.\nSA Police have not acted on this lead and she has a online petition running to have the site excavated. It is possible these allegations align with 2013-2018 allegations naming Harry Phipps by his son as being involved <ref> {url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWN3cHKeuCw}</ref> given a witness alleged he & another teenager were paid to dig a hole in a sand pit in his Cast Alloy factory premises nearby the previous weekend, where it might be this accident may have happened, indicating possibly McIntyre & Munro had procured the kids for Phipps and others unknown. Various witness have also stated Phipps had a cottage at the rear of the factory near the sand pit which was out of bounds to all staff where his son alleged Phipps engaged in secret activities. However no proof exists against Phipps in this matter.\n\nThe McIntyre children allegations are consistent with a story in New Idea Magazine on 28 Feb 2018 wherein a new witness alleged he saw the Beaumont children with 3 adults (2 men & a woman), the men possibly fitting the description of McIntyre Snr & Munro, around 1.30pm that day near Phipps house <ref> {url=https://www.newidea.com.au/beaumont-children-witness-comes-forward}</ref>. This report is relevant as Jane Beaumont bought food at the Wenzel bakery around 12 noon consisting of 1 pie, 5 pasties, 6 finger buns and 2 large bottles of fizzy drinks - too much food for 3 kids but enough for 6 people (3 adults & 3 children) <ref> {url=https://thebeaumontchildren.com.au/what-happened-to-the-beaumont-children/}</ref>.

Another important distinction is that von Einem was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old and suspected of killing men in their teens and twenties; victims older than the Beaumont children and the children who were abducted from the [[Adelaide Oval]]. Such disparities amongst victims of a [[serial killer]] are not unheard of, but unusual.<ref name=\"O'Brien2002\"/>\n\nThe reference to surgical experimentation von Einem had purportedly made to Mr B also corresponded to the [[coroner]]'s reports on several of the murdered youths.

They disappeared while on their way to school on 26 August 1970 and their bodies were found several days later in a dry creek bed. Both girls had been strangled. Brown's July 2000 trial was delayed after his lawyer applied for a section 613 verdict (unfit to be tried) from the jury. He was never retried as he was found to have [[dementia]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Brown died in 2002.\n\nAlong with von Einem, Brown is considered to be the most likely suspect for the Beaumont abduction as he bore a striking similarity to an [[Facial composite|identikit]] picture of the suspect for both the Beaumont and Adelaide Oval cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/suspected-mass-child-killer-is-buried-with-his-secrets-at-90-20020722-gduf0t.html|title=Suspected mass child killer is buried with his secrets at 90|date=22 July 2002|website=The Age}}</ref> A search for a connection to the Beaumonts was unsuccessful as no employment records existed that could shed light on his movements at the time.

Additionally, she had reported that the man was wearing a pair of [[horn rimmed glasses]], a pair of which Brown is known to have worn, something considered by police to be another noteworthy point in the identification.

In 2006, O'Neill lost an injunction in the [[High Court of Australia]] to stop the broadcast of a documentary ''The Fishermen'' which attempted to link him to the Beaumont case.

Davie said that although there was no evidence to link O'Neill to the disappearance, he was persuaded that O'Neill was to blame. \"I asked him about the Beaumonts and he said: 'I couldn't have done it. I was in [[Melbourne]] at that time.' That is not a denial.\" Later asked again if he had murdered the children, he replied, \"Look, on legal advice I am not going to say where I was or when I was there.\" Although O'Neill claims never to have visited Adelaide, his work in the opal industry at the time required that he frequently visit [[Coober Pedy]], which would have required him to pass through Adelaide.

Before his death, he had been subjected to \"surgery\" &mdash; his abdomen had been sliced open, and had been [[shaved]] prior to this. Part of his bowel had been removed and Langley had died from loss of blood. Over the next few months more bodies were found. The dismembered skeletal remains of Peter Stogneff (14) were found almost a year after his disappearance and Alan Barnes (18) was found mutilated in a similar manner to Langley. A fifth victim, Richard Kelvin (15), was found in 1983, once again with the same mutilations. Bevan Spencer von Einem was convicted of Kelvin's murder in 1984 and was charged with the murders of Barnes and Langley in 1989. However, the prosecution was forced to enter a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' (unwilling to pursue) when crucial evidence was deemed inadmissible. These crimes have been known collectively as the Family Murders; police believe that a core group of four people and up to eight associates were involved in the murders.
