The plot focuses on a widow who discovers her late husband led a double life and had a son with another woman during the course of their marriage. The film premiered on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] and while the performances were met with positive reviews, the storyline has been met with some criticism.\n\n==Plot==\nBusinessman Richard Kennerly is married to the socialite Catherine, and they have a daughter, Beth. Richard leads a seemingly normal life in [[Beverly Hills]] with his wife and daughter, but this masks an affair he has been having for the past 8 years with an artist, Nina Simon, with whom he has a six-year-old son, Eric. Richard set Nina and their son up in a beachside home in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] and has been living a double life. Catherine is unaware of Nina and Richard's relationship, while Nina accepts the circumstances for what they are and continues the affair.\n\nWhile at home with his wife and daughter, Beth explains to Richard that she wants to move out with her boyfriend. Richard soon becomes severely ill. Unable to recover, he passes away from the fatal illness that plagued him and the double life that he once lived is exposed. Catherine discovers the extra marital relationship that he had and becomes aware of who his mistress was.\n\nDevastated, Catherine discovers Richard's son, Eric, with Nina but realizes that he left nothing for the child. Catherine and Nina begin to feud, and Catherine refuses to acknowledge the child's existence. Nina wants her son's education to be paid for, but Catherine clashes with her. The two women get into a fist fight at Richard's funeral.
