The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years. This however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in their home, so they can have a chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors.

Divorce is not perceived as a solution to any matrimonial-related problem because it hinders the development or progress of the basic community unit. Therefore, husband and wife are obligated to fix any problems within the boundaries of the marriage.<ref name=Ozamiz/>\n\nWomen in the pre-colonial Philippines enjoyed nearly equal status with men {{dubious|date=February 2015}}.  Prior to colonization, both men and women could get a divorce for the following reasons: failure to meet family obligations, childlessness, and infidelity.  Children, regardless of gender, and properties were equally divided in a divorce. Since a man needed to pay a dowry to the woman's family, she was required to give it back should she be found at fault.  If the man was at fault, he then lost the right to get back his dowry.\n\nIn the Philippines, society valued offspring regardless of gender. Female children were as valuable as male ones, mainly because they recognized that women are as important as men. Parents provide equal opportunities to their children. Filipino daughters can also go to school like Filipino sons, Filipino daughters can also inherit property like Filipino sons, and Filipino daughters can also become village chiefs like Filipino sons.\n\nIn 1994, the [[John and Lorena Bobbitt]] case, in which a wife [[Penis removal|cut off the penis]] of her sleeping husband, seized the attention of media in the [[Philippines]], which reported that a similar incident had occurred in [[Cebu]] the previous November.

Heavy works that require more strength is done by the husband. Now, the chore work is evenly distributed with the men doing just as much work as the women{{dubious|date=February 2015}}. The scope of their functions include cooking, cleaning, teaching the children, washing clothes, repairs, budgeting, and helping in the farm. The husband is the one who makes sure the farm would yield quality crops, so he does all the maintenance work. In some cases, where the husband needs help from other men, the wife would make sure that the men are fed, so she cooks food and bring it to the farm. The Filipino women, ensures that everyone is well fed, including any workers, relatives, or visitors.\n\nIn general, Filipino women find pride in their work. They do not find themselves alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives them a sense of dignity and responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life.<ref name=Ozamiz/> In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alcantara|first=Adelamar N.|date=1994-01-01|title=Gender Roles, Fertility, and the Status of Married Filipino Men and Women|jstor=41853665|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=42|issue=1/4|pages=94\u2013109}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Women Workers in the Philippines|last=|first=|publisher=National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1900s, the female workforce in the Philippines was also a highly debated topic during workers\u2019 conferences.  In 1910, during the first Congress of Labor, the decision to enact a law that would regulate the employment of women and children was approved due to poor working conditions (\u201cdark and ill-ventilated rooms, smoke-filled factories\u201d, etc.) for women and children.<ref name=\":1\" /> Then, in March 1923, \u201cAn Act to Regulate the Employment of Women and Children in Agricultural and Non-Agricultural Establishments and Other Workplaces\u201d was passed to oversee the welfare of women and children.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1960, under the Department of Labor, the Bureau of Women and Minors was created and was responsible for the promotion, development, and the protection of the welfare of working women and minors.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since then, more acts were made to oversee the welfare of women workers, as seen in both the 1935 and 1973 constitutions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Filipino women and Philippine politics===\n{{Main article|Women and government in the Philippines}}\n\n[[File:Corazon Aquino 1992.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Corazon C.

They have become presidents, senators, congresswomen, mayors. They have served in government offices, and have held cabinet positions for presidents. Filipino women have proven that they are capable of carrying out responsibilities and tasks as well as their male counterparts. There are 48 women Representatives elected in the 15th Congress (2010 national election). They accounted for 21.6 percent of the total 222 Representatives as members of the Lower House. In 2010 Senatorial election, there were 14 women who ran out of 61 candidates (23.0%), of which two entered the top 12 winning senators (16.7%).<ref>[http://pcw.gov.ph/statistics/201205/women-participation-politics-and-governance]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe number of [[Women and government in the Philippines|women who engage in politics]] are smaller compare to their male counterparts. This was primarily because engagement in politics is considered \"dirty.\"\n\nA recent study revealed that there is a re-emergence of the empowerment of Filipino women through the political process, just as they were prior to the arrival of conquerors from Spain. Philippine women are rediscovering their strengths. Filipino women had been successful in implementing policies by becoming executive staff members, advisers to politicians, and as advocates within non-governmental organizations.<ref name=Shah/>\n\nModern-day Filipino women are making strides in electoral politics by initiating more female-oriented programs. They are performing well as leaders, although generally, Filipino women still often earn political seats by having fathers and husbands who are politically connected, a \"dynasty system\" that hinders other Filipino women from joining the electoral process. Other factors that prevent full-engagement of other well-qualified Filipino women from the Philippine political scene are the expense in politics and the importance of the family name.<ref name=Shah/>\n\nParticipation of Filipino women in Philippine politics was encouraged during the Beijing Declaration in 1995 at the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women. In February 2005, however, a United Nations review on the progress of Philippine women and their role in politics revealed that despite \"an increase in the quality of female politicians, there was not enough increase in\" the number of women participants in government activities. From 1992 to 2001, Filipino women had been elected as local chief executives, functioning as mayors, governors, and captains of villages. One influential factor contributing to the increasing number of female politicians, is the elevation of Corazon Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as Philippine women Presidents.<ref name=Shah/><ref name=Vartti2/>\n\nWomen like Aurora Javate-De Dios are worked and are working to expand rights for Filipino women within the political sphere.  De Dios went to school with hopes of entering diplomacy, and ended up becoming an underground leader involved in the publishing of anti-Marcos newsletters.  This political involvement is what led De Dios to join forces with other Filipino women in creating MAKIBAKA, otherwise known as the Free Movement of New Women.  These women were in opposition to the enlisting of Filipino men in the Vietnam War, and wanted to expand women's rights.  Not long after its creation, MAKIBAKA was disbanded due to martial law created in Marcos' reign.  Many of the women were imprisoned for their involvement. De Dios was imprisoned for three months due to her involvement with anti-Marcos leaders.  After her imprisonment, De Dios worked to create WSAP, Women's Studies Association of the Philippines.  Through WSAP, De Dios trained teachers from all over the country on theory and practice, covering things like gender sensitivity training, the history of the women's rights movement, and how to teach in a feminist framework.  This sensibility that De Dios has cultivated has become an institution of sorts, as a workshop was held to discuss these experiences during the World Conference on Women in Beijing.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Imam|first=Hyat|date=March 1995|title=The Diplomat|url=http://www.isiswomen.org/phocadownload/print/isispub/wia/wia1995-3/WIA1995-3-07-TheDiplomat.pdf|journal=Women in Action|volume=|pages=32-35|via=}}</ref>  \n\nDe Dios  has not only worked to allow women equal opportunity in education but has been a part of lobbying for several acts in the Philippines, including the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act and the Violence Against Women and Their Children Act.

The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years. This however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in their home, so they can have a chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors.

Divorce is not perceived as a solution to any matrimonial-related problem because it hinders the development or progress of the basic community unit. Therefore, husband and wife are obligated to fix any problems within the boundaries of the marriage.<ref name=Ozamiz/>\n\nWomen in the pre-colonial Philippines enjoyed nearly equal status with men {{dubious|date=February 2015}}.  Prior to colonization, both men and women could get a divorce for the following reasons: failure to meet family obligations, childlessness, and infidelity.  Children, regardless of gender, and properties were equally divided in a divorce. Since a man needed to pay a dowry to the woman's family, she was required to give it back should she be found at fault.  If the man was at fault, he then lost the right to get back his dowry.\n\nIn the Philippines, society valued offspring regardless of gender. Female children were as valuable as male ones, mainly because they recognized that women are as important as men. Parents provide equal opportunities to their children. Filipino daughters can also go to school like Filipino sons, Filipino daughters can also inherit property like Filipino sons, and Filipino daughters can also become village chiefs like Filipino sons.\n\nIn 1994, the [[John and Lorena Bobbitt]] case, in which a wife [[Penis removal|cut off the penis]] of her sleeping husband, seized the attention of media in the [[Philippines]], which reported that a similar incident had occurred in [[Cebu]] the previous November.

In some cases, where the husband needs help from other men, the wife would make sure that the men are fed, so she cooks food and bring it to the farm. The Filipino women, ensures that everyone is well fed, including any workers, relatives, or visitors.\n\nIn general, Filipino women find pride in their work. They do not find themselves alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives them a sense of dignity and responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life.<ref name=Ozamiz/> In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alcantara|first=Adelamar N.|date=1994-01-01|title=Gender Roles, Fertility, and the Status of Married Filipino Men and Women|jstor=41853665|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=42|issue=1/4|pages=94\u2013109}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Women Workers in the Philippines|last=|first=|publisher=National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1900s, the female workforce in the Philippines was also a highly debated topic during workers\u2019 conferences.  In 1910, during the first Congress of Labor, the decision to enact a law that would regulate the employment of women and children was approved due to poor working conditions (\u201cdark and ill-ventilated rooms, smoke-filled factories\u201d, etc.) for women and children.<ref name=\":1\" /> Then, in March 1923, \u201cAn Act to Regulate the Employment of Women and Children in Agricultural and Non-Agricultural Establishments and Other Workplaces\u201d was passed to oversee the welfare of women and children.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1960, under the Department of Labor, the Bureau of Women and Minors was created and was responsible for the promotion, development, and the protection of the welfare of working women and minors.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since then, more acts were made to oversee the welfare of women workers, as seen in both the 1935 and 1973 constitutions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Filipino women and Philippine politics===\n{{Main article|Women and government in the Philippines}}\n\n[[File:Corazon Aquino 1992.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Corazon C. Aquino]], 1992, the first female president of the Republic of the Philippines, recognized by the international diplomatic community as the \"Mother of Asian Democracy\".]]\nCompared to other countries, Filipino women have gained and enjoyed equal rights with men. They have become presidents, senators, congresswomen, mayors. They have served in government offices, and have held cabinet positions for presidents. Filipino women have proven that they are capable of carrying out responsibilities and tasks as well as their male counterparts. There are 48 women Representatives elected in the 15th Congress (2010 national election). They accounted for 21.6 percent of the total 222 Representatives as members of the Lower House. In 2010 Senatorial election, there were 14 women who ran out of 61 candidates (23.0%), of which two entered the top 12 winning senators (16.7%).<ref>[http://pcw.gov.ph/statistics/201205/women-participation-politics-and-governance]{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe number of [[Women and government in the Philippines|women who engage in politics]] are smaller compare to their male counterparts. This was primarily because engagement in politics is considered \"dirty.\"\n\nA recent study revealed that there is a re-emergence of the empowerment of Filipino women through the political process, just as they were prior to the arrival of conquerors from Spain. Philippine women are rediscovering their strengths. Filipino women had been successful in implementing policies by becoming executive staff members, advisers to politicians, and as advocates within non-governmental organizations.<ref name=Shah/>\n\nModern-day Filipino women are making strides in electoral politics by initiating more female-oriented programs. They are performing well as leaders, although generally, Filipino women still often earn political seats by having fathers and husbands who are politically connected, a \"dynasty system\" that hinders other Filipino women from joining the electoral process. Other factors that prevent full-engagement of other well-qualified Filipino women from the Philippine political scene are the expense in politics and the importance of the family name.<ref name=Shah/>\n\nParticipation of Filipino women in Philippine politics was encouraged during the Beijing Declaration in 1995 at the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women. In February 2005, however, a United Nations review on the progress of Philippine women and their role in politics revealed that despite \"an increase in the quality of female politicians, there was not enough increase in\" the number of women participants in government activities. From 1992 to 2001, Filipino women had been elected as local chief executives, functioning as mayors, governors, and captains of villages. One influential factor contributing to the increasing number of female politicians, is the elevation of Corazon Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as Philippine women Presidents.<ref name=Shah/><ref name=Vartti2/>\n\nWomen like Aurora Javate-De Dios are worked and are working to expand rights for Filipino women within the political sphere.  De Dios went to school with hopes of entering diplomacy, and ended up becoming an underground leader involved in the publishing of anti-Marcos newsletters.  This political involvement is what led De Dios to join forces with other Filipino women in creating MAKIBAKA, otherwise known as the Free Movement of New Women.  These women were in opposition to the enlisting of Filipino men in the Vietnam War, and wanted to expand women's rights.  Not long after its creation, MAKIBAKA was disbanded due to martial law created in Marcos' reign.  Many of the women were imprisoned for their involvement. De Dios was imprisoned for three months due to her involvement with anti-Marcos leaders.  After her imprisonment, De Dios worked to create WSAP, Women's Studies Association of the Philippines.  Through WSAP, De Dios trained teachers from all over the country on theory and practice, covering things like gender sensitivity training, the history of the women's rights movement, and how to teach in a feminist framework.  This sensibility that De Dios has cultivated has become an institution of sorts, as a workshop was held to discuss these experiences during the World Conference on Women in Beijing.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Imam|first=Hyat|date=March 1995|title=The Diplomat|url=http://www.isiswomen.org/phocadownload/print/isispub/wia/wia1995-3/WIA1995-3-07-TheDiplomat.pdf|journal=Women in Action|volume=|pages=32-35|via=}}</ref>  \n\nDe Dios  has not only worked to allow women equal opportunity in education but has been a part of lobbying for several acts in the Philippines, including the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act and the Violence Against Women and Their Children Act.
