{"title_page": "Women in engineering in the United States", "text_new": "{{Women in society sidebar}}\nHistorically, women in the [[United States]] have been represented at lower rates than men in both [[science]] and [[engineering]] [[college]] programs and careers.  Over time, this pattern has led to a significantly higher concentration of male professional engineers compared to women.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}} Additionally, this disparity has led to careers in [[Education]], [[History]], [[English language|English]], [[Humanities]] and the like to be seen as \u201cfeminine\u201d careers and areas of study.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}} Some Feminist theorists suggest that these social and historical factors have perpetuated women\u2019s low participation rates in engineering over time.{{sfn|Polachek|1978}} Numerous explanations and points of view have been offered to explain women's participation rates in this field. These explanations include beliefs regarding women's lack of interest in science and engineering, their physiological inability to succeed as engineers, and environmental factors in women's [[childhood]]s that discourage them from entering science and engineering fields.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}\n\nNegative perceptions of female engineers may play a role in explaining their low numbers within the field.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}} According to recent statistics, college-educated women are less than half as likely as men to be employed in science and engineering jobs.\n\nTwo forms of [[activism]] tasked with raising awareness include both organizations on college campuses and those geared towards society at large.\n\n==History==\n\nIn the early 1960s, a President\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women emphasized the need for women to fill a shortage of jobs in [[teaching]], science, and engineering.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}} In 1960, however, less than 1% of recorded engineers were women. Furthermore, female engineers that were employed were less likely to have obtained advanced degrees in their field than men.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}} Research has shown that these trends were reflective of both men's and women's dominant opinions regarding women's role in the workforce throughout this period. At the time, both groups largely emphasized women\u2019s roles as traditional homemakers and mothers rather than as serious scientists or engineers.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Pendleton|1978}}\n\nDespite changing political views towards women and minorities during the [[civil rights movement]], college women\u2019s enrollment rates into engineering were still relatively low when compared to men's.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}} For example, in a study of over 440 college campuses nationwide throughout 1971-72, approximately 17% of polled Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors were women.<ref name=autogenerated10>Montinelli, 1976{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref> This coincides with the fact that, throughout this period, there was little recorded formal discrimination in the American educational system.{{sfn|Cole|1981}} Women who actually applied to engineering programs were enrolled at similar rates to men. Early increases in these numbers did occur, though, throughout 1968-78. During this period, there was an estimated 100% increase in the number of female science and engineering majors throughout the [[United States]].{{sfn|Cole|1981}} However, it was also estimated that they still accounted for less than 4.9% of such majors throughout this period.{{sfn|Cole|1981}}\n\nDespite women\u2019s increasing numbers in science and engineering fields, [[affirmative action]] and similar efforts were implemented throughout the U.S. to increase STEM enrollment rates.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}<ref name=autogenerated10/>{{sfn|Perrucci|1970}} It was proposed, among other factors, that early socialization by elementary schools and social stereotyping was to blame for this issue.  In the mid 1980s, a shortage of qualified engineers was predicted by the year 2000, further instigating efforts to both recruit and retain women in these fields.<ref name=autogenerated13>Freckman, 1975{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref>  Existing groups that promote women in engineering: ASCE Task force Committee on Women in Civil Engineering, Extraordinary Women Engineers Project Coalition.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dKptTDl6eUcC&pg=PA2&dq=changing+our+world++hatch|title=Changing Our World: True Stories of Women Engineers|last=Hatch|first=Sybil E.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=9780784408353|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics and relevant data==\n[[File:Percentage of Engineering Bachelor\u2019s Degrees Awarded to Women by School.png|right|300px|Percentage of Engineering Bachelor\u2019sDegrees Awarded to Womenby School]]\nAccording to the [[National Science Foundation]], overall, women have higher college graduation rates compared to men.

The percentage increase in the computer science industry displayed was larger, increasing from approximately 10% in 1989 to 21% in 2008.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nConcerning [[ethnic group|minority]] ([[African American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) women, the percentages of engineering bachelor\u2019s recipients increased from approximately 7% in 1989 to 12% in 2008.{{fact|date=March 2020}} The percentages of minority  women with engineering [[doctoral degrees]] were much lower, however, barely increasing from 1% throughout this period. [[Southeast Asians|Asian]] women actually accounted for a lower rate of engineering bachelor's degree during this time period, from approximately 2.5% to 5%. PhD  recipient rates from 1989 to 2008 were nearly identical to minority women\u2019s.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAccording to the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] in 2004, there were approximately 192,900 female engineers throughout the country, compared with over 1,515,000 men.<ref name=autogenerated15>National Society of Professional Engineers, 2004{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref> Of these women, approximately 1/3 of them were [[software engineers]] (62,900). Women were also employed in higher rates than men in [[environmental engineering]] (9% to 4%) and [[chemical engineering]] (7% to 4%). However, they were less likely than men to be employed in [[mechanical engineering]] (8% to 17%) and [[electrical engineering]] (12% to 18%).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1999, women made up approximately one quarter of all engineers under the age of 25, whereas they constituted one-twentieth of those over age 49. This age discrepancy has been attributed to women's notable, but recent, movement into engineering within the past few decades.<ref name=autogenerated15/> According to the Society of Women Engineers, women and other minorities constituted approximately 16%-17% of engineering graduate students from 1990-2003. Furthermore, in 2003 approximately 20% (approximately 12,000)of new engineers were women, compared with about 80% of men (approximately 49,000).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAccording to the ASEE, the top 10 colleges producing women engineers:<ref>ASEE Engineering by the Numbers Report, 2016{{vs|date=March 2020}} https://ira.asee.org/by-the-numbers/</ref>\n\n# Georgia Institute of Technology  \n# Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n# University of Michigan \n# Purdue University \n# Univ. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign \n# Ohio State University \n# Pennsylvania State University \n# University of Florida \n# Texas A&M University \n# Cornell University\n\n==Explanations for low participation rates==\n\nNumerous explanations have come forth to account for the lack of women engineering majors in college. Historically, women have both majored and remained in college engineering programs at lower rates than men.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}<ref name=autogenerated26>Corell, 2001{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref> One of the reasons used to explain this trend has been a supposed overemphasis on the traditional \"male breadwinner\" household model when it comes to organizing families today.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}} Although the percentage of families organized according to this model has declined considerably in recent decades, many individuals, including women, still see adult men as the primary [[wage]] earners in households where men were present.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}} Even if this is the case women represent close to  60% of university graduates, including biology mayors. [https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72 IES:  What is the percentage of degrees conferred by race and sex?]\n\nRecently, greater emphasis has been given to women\u2019s socialization throughout their childhood and [[adolescence]] years. Socialized early in their childhoods, girls are said to be raised in societies where science, engineering, and mathematical fields are largely promoted as being \u201cmale [[professions]]\u201d.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}} The [[Media (communication)|media]] has also been criticized for giving little representation of females within the industry. Instead, some scholars feel that the media is guilty of perpetuating [[Gender stereotype|gender stereotypes]] by representing women in traditional \u201cfemale occupations\u201d such as [[nurses]], school teachers, and [[housewives]].{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} Men help feed into this because they feel as if women aren't cut out for traditional engineering roles but rather one's where they don't have as much responsibility associated directly with the job itself.{{sfn|Cech|Rubineau|Silbey|Seron|2011}} This idea is supported by a study where STEM field applicants were given a first and second choice on their majors. The results showed that women were more likely to pick male dominated fields in their second choice rather than in their first. This study found that orientations toward certain fields of study were less segregated than actual behaviors, suggesting that cultural perception toward certain fields curbs the aspirations of women that are the most competent.{{sfn|Alon|DiPrete|2015}} One of the many reasons behind this is that it stems from the treatment that women face from their male peers during collaboration. Women have reported that the males in their groups assign the women routine managerial and secretarial work to complete, leaving the women to be excluded from the hands on engineering work.{{sfn|Silbey|2016}} The overall idea that women are underrepresented in the field has paved a way for these barrier to be raised against women becoming successful members within the field themselves.\n\n[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has suggested that subjects such as engineering may be less popular among women because they do not accommodate some of their typical interests with the interaction between living beings being one example. This is not necessarily to suggest, with [[Lawrence Summers]], that women are incapable or less fundamentally capable than men at engineering, but rather that they tend to be less interested in the subject in general.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6usiN4uoA&list=PLytTJqkSQqtr7BqC1Jf4nv3g2yDfu7Xmd&index=19</ref> The principle strength of this argument is that it explains the phenomenon without drawing tenuous links with difficult-to-measure influences such as 'culture' and 'role-models', but it is also to some degree reinforced by academic consensus, which was identified in the 'Social and Political views of American Professors' paper as 75% in favor of the claim that differing interests between men and women caused the disparity, rather than discrimination.<ref>{{cite report |first1=Neil |last1=Gross |first2=Solon |last2=Simmons |date=September 24, 2007 |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}{{self-published inline|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of [[Role model|role models]], and especially female role models, has also been emphasized as a means of increasing women\u2019s numbers in engineering.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1999}} Women with one or two engineering parents are said to be moderately more likely to major in such a field themselves.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}} Women also choose to look up to women who are already in the field as role models and mentors for their future career aspirations because they begin to think that they too can accomplish what they had once done themselves.{{sfn|Silbey|2016}} Additionally, encouragement from teachers, [[School counselor|counselors]], and [[Academic administration|administrators]]. are all said to have a positive impact on a women's chances at moving into engineering. Better high school preparation in mathematics, [[biology]], and [[chemistry]] were also said to better a women's success in an engineering career. However, according to some scholars, the above factors do not occur in a great enough number to compensate for women's current disadvantages.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}}{{sfn|Seymour|1999}} Thus, generally speaking, it is said that hopeful women engineers will remain largely [[Discriminate|discriminated]] against and have inadequate resources at improving their outlook unless substantial [[Social change|social changes]] are made to society.\n\n==Socialization and societal outcomes==\n\n===Educational outcomes===\nIt has been suggested that, due to the social and environmental factors described above, [[high school]] and college women tend to have lower [[confidence]] levels in their mathematical ability compared to men.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}<ref name=autogenerated26/>{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} Shelley Correll's observations using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) revealed that, on average, women who positively assessed their math ability before testing had a higher average score than women who did not rate themselves well. Moreover, [[longitudinal studies]] on both sets of women also revealed that the ones who did rate themselves highly were more likely to subsequently enroll in college-level [[calculus]].<ref name=autogenerated26/>\n\nGoldman later discovered that positive [[math]] assessments played an important role in women's choices to enroll in engineering.{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} However, other studies have before and since emphasized women\u2019s early life experiences in shaping their career aspirations. Feeling they are not skilled enough to successfully complete an engineering program or other advanced mathematical and/or science courses, some women perform poorly and thus complete a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}<ref name=autogenerated26/> If at all, differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s innate spatial memories were reported to account for about a 2:1 ratio of male-female engineers. Instead, in the U.S [[labor force]], there is approximately less than 1 female engineer for every 10 males.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup> According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2011, 13.6% of those employed in Architecture and engineering occupations were women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook-2012.pdf|title=Women in the Labor Force: A Databook}}</ref>\n\nFurther studies have also shown that a lack of pre-degree training in high school did not sufficiently explain women engineer's [[dropping out|dropout]] rates later in college.{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}} Analyses of males' and females' grades revealed that, on average, women who had dropped out of engineering programs were either approximately as qualified or even more qualified than their male peers who continued their studies. Additionally, surveyed female dropouts revealed that very few (approximately 9.8% to 11.5%) actually dropped out because they viewed the work as too difficult.{{sfn|Seymour|1995}}{{sfn|Seymour|1999}} Among their primary reasons for dropping were: loss of interest in the field, the inability to see themselves as professional engineers, inappropriate behavior from male [[peer group|peer]]s, and the highly pressured environment professional engineers worked under.{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} A phenomenon called \"[[stereotype threat]]\" may also help explain women's educational outcomes. Because of existing stereotypes regarding women's ability to excel in mathematics-intensive coursework, they are sometimes said to perform worse than they originally would have had the stereotypes not existed.{{sfn|Ceci|Williams|2011}}\n\n===Workplace outcomes===\n\nAccording to Hersch, a significant number of [[corporation]]s have increased the number of women engineers hired in the past couple of decades in response to [[political]] and social pressures.{{sfn|Hersh|2000}} In addition to their engineering expertise, women engineers are said to bring unique [[ethics of care|caring]] and non-technical problem solving skills along with an enlarged customer support base. Typically preceding these management changes were other policy shifts such as: 1) a company move from heavy to light [[manufacturing]]; 2) a greater emphasis on service and professional jobs; 3) improved working conditions, and 4) a general improvement of women\u2019s status on the job.{{sfn|Hersh|2000}}{{sfn|Preston|1994}}\n\nOverall, however, engineering is said to remain a highly gender-stratified occupation.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}}{{sfn|Hersh|2000}} Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and [[management]] positions than females, whose [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] prospects are usually more limited.{{sfn|Hersh|2000}}{{sfn|Preston|1994}}{{sfn|Devine|1992}} This reason, family and child obligations, and [[layoff]]s combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990\u2014a statistic over twice of that of men.{{sfn|Preston|1994}}\n\nIt has been suggested by Crompton and Sanderson that discrimination in high-level technical jobs is actually ''decreasing'' on the whole.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}} Moreover, they suggest that [[equal opportunity|equal-opportunities]] legislation ensures that men and women with appropriate [[human capital]] are treated equally in recruitment chances. Direct and indirect forms of exclusion were no longer said to be significant in sustaining gender segregation in engineering positions.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}} Statistically, [[gender pay gap]]s in engineering are actually lower than the national average. In STEM jobs, female wages are approximately 84% of men\u2019s, compared to 71% in non-STEM jobs.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}}{{sfn|Perrucci|1970}}{{sfn|Hersh|2000}} Moreover, it has also been stated that traditionally stereotypical images of engineering as \u201cdirty\u201d, \u201crugged\u201d, or \u201cmanly\u201d jobs are gradually being eroded\u2014opening employment opportunities for prospective women nationwide.{{sfn|Preston|1994}}{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}}{{sfn|Bona|Kelly|Jung|2010}}\n\nHowever, recent evidence suggests that gender discrimination is still a significant issue affecting women\u2019s confidence and performance in STEM careers. According to Logel, interacting with [[sexist]] men may trigger a stressed-induced phenomenon called \u201csocial identity threat\u201d in women.{{sfn|Logel|Walton|Spencer|Iserman|2009}} Women engineers who faced regular exposure to sexist men on the job were said perform worse on aptitude tests than women who weren't exposed to such individuals. While women who worked in low-[[stress (psychological)|stress]] environments reported higher levels of confidence and [[self-actualization|self-fulfillment]], discriminated women were reportedly more likely to suppress their feelings and/or let their problems go unannounced.{{sfn|Logel|Walton|Spencer|Iserman|2009}} Such behavior is said to be detrimental to both the women engineers themselves and the workplace, where sexist behavior is likely to persist.\n\n==Initiatives to promote engineering to women==\n\nAs science and engineering have become more pervasive in [[society]], women's participation rates in these fields have not seen a proportionate increase.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} According to Cuny and Aspray, this may potentially result in a lack of women's [[aptitude|talent]] in the fields, which may further reduce employment opportunities for both employer and employee{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} In order to make engineering more appealing to young women, a broader acceptance criteria into such programs has been proposed.{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} Specifically, admissions boards are encouraged to take other admissions factors into account such as: [[extracurricular]] accomplishments, applicants' desire to be admitted into the program, and [[communication skills]]. Additionally, it has been strongly suggested that admissions boards prioritize ethnic diversity.{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}}<ref name=autogenerated19>Milgrim, 2011{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\nResearch has revealed that [[high school]]- and college-age women commonly see the STEM environment as a \"chilly, male-dominated\" environment that is highly impersonal and unsympathetic to women's unique needs.{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}}{{sfn|Bona|Kelly|Jung|2010}} \"Social [[coping (psychology)|coping]]\" has thus been a mechanism which has been cited to help women deal with the challenges and [[stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with engineering's rigorous coursework and careers.{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}} [[Multiple regression]] analysis has revealed that high levels of social coping were a stronger predictor of commitment to staying in engineering studies for women than men. Put more simply, women who used social coping were less likely than men (who were actually found to be ''more'' likely) to drop out of college engineering programs. Consequently, school [[teacher]]s, staff, parents, and other figures have been encouraged to provide a more accommodating environment for social coping.{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}}<ref name=autogenerated19/>\n\nAn increase in influential female role models has also been cited as a way to increase women's engineering enrollment rates.{{sfn|Bona|Kelly|Jung|2010}} [[Survey methodology|survey]]s collected among 141 female engineering students across the country have shown that many women who placed high confidence levels in their math and science ability also had parents who modeled less traditional [[gender roles]]. Thus, to increase women's enrollment and retention rates in engineering, scholars have suggested that a de-emphasis away from the highly popularized \"[[nuclear family]]\" model is crucial.{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was established in May 27, 1950<ref name=\":0\" /> by [[Elsie Eaves]] as a non-profit educational and service organization that attempted both to raise awareness of female engineers and increase their enrollment rates.{{fact|date=March 2020}} SWE held their first meeting with 50 engineers at Cooper Union in NJ.<ref name=\":0\" /> With membership now exceeding 17,000 members in over 300 student organizations across the United States, the SWE's principal aims are to inform female students about opportunities in the field of engineering and to encourage female engineers to attain high levels of achievement.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Notable American women engineers (in alphabetical order)==\n\n* [[Nora Stanton Blatch Barney]] (1883\u20131971) \u2013 The first woman to receive a degree in civil engineering from [[Cornell University]], in 1905, when she was also accepted as a junior member of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].

Over time, this pattern has led to a significantly higher concentration of male professional engineers compared to women.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}} Additionally, this disparity has led to careers in [[Education]], [[History]], [[English language|English]], [[Humanities]] and the like to be seen as \u201cfeminine\u201d careers and areas of study.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}} Some Feminist theorists suggest that these social and historical factors have perpetuated women\u2019s low participation rates in engineering over time.{{sfn|Polachek|1978}} Numerous explanations and points of view have been offered to explain women's participation rates in this field. These explanations include beliefs regarding women's lack of interest in science and engineering, their physiological inability to succeed as engineers, and environmental factors in women's [[childhood]]s that discourage them from entering science and engineering fields.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}\n\nNegative perceptions of female engineers may play a role in explaining their low numbers within the field.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}} According to recent statistics, college-educated women are less than half as likely as men to be employed in science and engineering jobs.\n\nTwo forms of [[activism]] tasked with raising awareness include both organizations on college campuses and those geared towards society at large.\n\n==History==\n\nIn the early 1960s, a President\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women emphasized the need for women to fill a shortage of jobs in [[teaching]], science, and engineering.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}} In 1960, however, less than 1% of recorded engineers were women. Furthermore, female engineers that were employed were less likely to have obtained advanced degrees in their field than men.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}} Research has shown that these trends were reflective of both men's and women's dominant opinions regarding women's role in the workforce throughout this period. At the time, both groups largely emphasized women\u2019s roles as traditional homemakers and mothers rather than as serious scientists or engineers.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Pendleton|1978}}\n\nDespite changing political views towards women and minorities during the [[civil rights movement]], college women\u2019s enrollment rates into engineering were still relatively low when compared to men's.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}} For example, in a study of over 440 college campuses nationwide throughout 1971-72, approximately 17% of polled Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors were women.<ref name=autogenerated10>Montinelli, 1976{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref> This coincides with the fact that, throughout this period, there was little recorded formal discrimination in the American educational system.{{sfn|Cole|1981}} Women who actually applied to engineering programs were enrolled at similar rates to men. Early increases in these numbers did occur, though, throughout 1968-78. During this period, there was an estimated 100% increase in the number of female science and engineering majors throughout the [[United States]].{{sfn|Cole|1981}} However, it was also estimated that they still accounted for less than 4.9% of such majors throughout this period.{{sfn|Cole|1981}}\n\nDespite women\u2019s increasing numbers in science and engineering fields, [[affirmative action]] and similar efforts were implemented throughout the U.S. to increase STEM enrollment rates.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}<ref name=autogenerated10/>{{sfn|Perrucci|1970}} It was proposed, among other factors, that early socialization by elementary schools and social stereotyping was to blame for this issue.

[[Southeast Asians|Asian]] women actually accounted for a lower rate of engineering bachelor's degree during this time period, from approximately 2.5% to 5%. PhD  recipient rates from 1989 to 2008 were nearly identical to minority women\u2019s.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAccording to the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] in 2004, there were approximately 192,900 female engineers throughout the country, compared with over 1,515,000 men.<ref name=autogenerated15>National Society of Professional Engineers, 2004{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref> Of these women, approximately 1/3 of them were [[software engineers]] (62,900). Women were also employed in higher rates than men in [[environmental engineering]] (9% to 4%) and [[chemical engineering]] (7% to 4%). However, they were less likely than men to be employed in [[mechanical engineering]] (8% to 17%) and [[electrical engineering]] (12% to 18%).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 1999, women made up approximately one quarter of all engineers under the age of 25, whereas they constituted one-twentieth of those over age 49. This age discrepancy has been attributed to women's notable, but recent, movement into engineering within the past few decades.<ref name=autogenerated15/> According to the Society of Women Engineers, women and other minorities constituted approximately 16%-17% of engineering graduate students from 1990-2003. Furthermore, in 2003 approximately 20% (approximately 12,000)of new engineers were women, compared with about 80% of men (approximately 49,000).{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nAccording to the ASEE, the top 10 colleges producing women engineers:<ref>ASEE Engineering by the Numbers Report, 2016{{vs|date=March 2020}} https://ira.asee.org/by-the-numbers/</ref>\n\n# Georgia Institute of Technology  \n# Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n# University of Michigan \n# Purdue University \n# Univ. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign \n# Ohio State University \n# Pennsylvania State University \n# University of Florida \n# Texas A&M University \n# Cornell University\n\n==Explanations for low participation rates==\n\nNumerous explanations have come forth to account for the lack of women engineering majors in college. Historically, women have both majored and remained in college engineering programs at lower rates than men.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}<ref name=autogenerated26>Corell, 2001{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref> One of the reasons used to explain this trend has been a supposed overemphasis on the traditional \"male breadwinner\" household model when it comes to organizing families today.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}} Although the percentage of families organized according to this model has declined considerably in recent decades, many individuals, including women, still see adult men as the primary [[wage]] earners in households where men were present.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}} Even if this is the case women represent close to  60% of university graduates, including biology mayors. [https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72 IES:  What is the percentage of degrees conferred by race and sex?]\n\nRecently, greater emphasis has been given to women\u2019s socialization throughout their childhood and [[adolescence]] years. Socialized early in their childhoods, girls are said to be raised in societies where science, engineering, and mathematical fields are largely promoted as being \u201cmale [[professions]]\u201d.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}} The [[Media (communication)|media]] has also been criticized for giving little representation of females within the industry. Instead, some scholars feel that the media is guilty of perpetuating [[Gender stereotype|gender stereotypes]] by representing women in traditional \u201cfemale occupations\u201d such as [[nurses]], school teachers, and [[housewives]].{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} Men help feed into this because they feel as if women aren't cut out for traditional engineering roles but rather one's where they don't have as much responsibility associated directly with the job itself.{{sfn|Cech|Rubineau|Silbey|Seron|2011}} This idea is supported by a study where STEM field applicants were given a first and second choice on their majors. The results showed that women were more likely to pick male dominated fields in their second choice rather than in their first. This study found that orientations toward certain fields of study were less segregated than actual behaviors, suggesting that cultural perception toward certain fields curbs the aspirations of women that are the most competent.{{sfn|Alon|DiPrete|2015}} One of the many reasons behind this is that it stems from the treatment that women face from their male peers during collaboration. Women have reported that the males in their groups assign the women routine managerial and secretarial work to complete, leaving the women to be excluded from the hands on engineering work.{{sfn|Silbey|2016}} The overall idea that women are underrepresented in the field has paved a way for these barrier to be raised against women becoming successful members within the field themselves.\n\n[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has suggested that subjects such as engineering may be less popular among women because they do not accommodate some of their typical interests with the interaction between living beings being one example. This is not necessarily to suggest, with [[Lawrence Summers]], that women are incapable or less fundamentally capable than men at engineering, but rather that they tend to be less interested in the subject in general.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6usiN4uoA&list=PLytTJqkSQqtr7BqC1Jf4nv3g2yDfu7Xmd&index=19</ref> The principle strength of this argument is that it explains the phenomenon without drawing tenuous links with difficult-to-measure influences such as 'culture' and 'role-models', but it is also to some degree reinforced by academic consensus, which was identified in the 'Social and Political views of American Professors' paper as 75% in favor of the claim that differing interests between men and women caused the disparity, rather than discrimination.<ref>{{cite report |first1=Neil |last1=Gross |first2=Solon |last2=Simmons |date=September 24, 2007 |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}{{self-published inline|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of [[Role model|role models]], and especially female role models, has also been emphasized as a means of increasing women\u2019s numbers in engineering.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1999}} Women with one or two engineering parents are said to be moderately more likely to major in such a field themselves.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}} Women also choose to look up to women who are already in the field as role models and mentors for their future career aspirations because they begin to think that they too can accomplish what they had once done themselves.{{sfn|Silbey|2016}} Additionally, encouragement from teachers, [[School counselor|counselors]], and [[Academic administration|administrators]]. are all said to have a positive impact on a women's chances at moving into engineering. Better high school preparation in mathematics, [[biology]], and [[chemistry]] were also said to better a women's success in an engineering career. However, according to some scholars, the above factors do not occur in a great enough number to compensate for women's current disadvantages.{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}}{{sfn|Seymour|1999}} Thus, generally speaking, it is said that hopeful women engineers will remain largely [[Discriminate|discriminated]] against and have inadequate resources at improving their outlook unless substantial [[Social change|social changes]] are made to society.\n\n==Socialization and societal outcomes==\n\n===Educational outcomes===\nIt has been suggested that, due to the social and environmental factors described above, [[high school]] and college women tend to have lower [[confidence]] levels in their mathematical ability compared to men.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}<ref name=autogenerated26/>{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} Shelley Correll's observations using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) revealed that, on average, women who positively assessed their math ability before testing had a higher average score than women who did not rate themselves well. Moreover, [[longitudinal studies]] on both sets of women also revealed that the ones who did rate themselves highly were more likely to subsequently enroll in college-level [[calculus]].<ref name=autogenerated26/>\n\nGoldman later discovered that positive [[math]] assessments played an important role in women's choices to enroll in engineering.{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} However, other studies have before and since emphasized women\u2019s early life experiences in shaping their career aspirations. Feeling they are not skilled enough to successfully complete an engineering program or other advanced mathematical and/or science courses, some women perform poorly and thus complete a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}<ref name=autogenerated26/> If at all, differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s innate spatial memories were reported to account for about a 2:1 ratio of male-female engineers. Instead, in the U.S [[labor force]], there is approximately less than 1 female engineer for every 10 males.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup> According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2011, 13.6% of those employed in Architecture and engineering occupations were women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook-2012.pdf|title=Women in the Labor Force: A Databook}}</ref>\n\nFurther studies have also shown that a lack of pre-degree training in high school did not sufficiently explain women engineer's [[dropping out|dropout]] rates later in college.{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}} Analyses of males' and females' grades revealed that, on average, women who had dropped out of engineering programs were either approximately as qualified or even more qualified than their male peers who continued their studies. Additionally, surveyed female dropouts revealed that very few (approximately 9.8% to 11.5%) actually dropped out because they viewed the work as too difficult.{{sfn|Seymour|1995}}{{sfn|Seymour|1999}} Among their primary reasons for dropping were: loss of interest in the field, the inability to see themselves as professional engineers, inappropriate behavior from male [[peer group|peer]]s, and the highly pressured environment professional engineers worked under.{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} A phenomenon called \"[[stereotype threat]]\" may also help explain women's educational outcomes. Because of existing stereotypes regarding women's ability to excel in mathematics-intensive coursework, they are sometimes said to perform worse than they originally would have had the stereotypes not existed.{{sfn|Ceci|Williams|2011}}\n\n===Workplace outcomes===\n\nAccording to Hersch, a significant number of [[corporation]]s have increased the number of women engineers hired in the past couple of decades in response to [[political]] and social pressures.{{sfn|Hersh|2000}} In addition to their engineering expertise, women engineers are said to bring unique [[ethics of care|caring]] and non-technical problem solving skills along with an enlarged customer support base. Typically preceding these management changes were other policy shifts such as: 1) a company move from heavy to light [[manufacturing]]; 2) a greater emphasis on service and professional jobs; 3) improved working conditions, and 4) a general improvement of women\u2019s status on the job.{{sfn|Hersh|2000}}{{sfn|Preston|1994}}\n\nOverall, however, engineering is said to remain a highly gender-stratified occupation.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}}{{sfn|Seymour|1995}}{{sfn|Hersh|2000}} Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and [[management]] positions than females, whose [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] prospects are usually more limited.{{sfn|Hersh|2000}}{{sfn|Preston|1994}}{{sfn|Devine|1992}} This reason, family and child obligations, and [[layoff]]s combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990\u2014a statistic over twice of that of men.{{sfn|Preston|1994}}\n\nIt has been suggested by Crompton and Sanderson that discrimination in high-level technical jobs is actually ''decreasing'' on the whole.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}} Moreover, they suggest that [[equal opportunity|equal-opportunities]] legislation ensures that men and women with appropriate [[human capital]] are treated equally in recruitment chances. Direct and indirect forms of exclusion were no longer said to be significant in sustaining gender segregation in engineering positions.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}} Statistically, [[gender pay gap]]s in engineering are actually lower than the national average. In STEM jobs, female wages are approximately 84% of men\u2019s, compared to 71% in non-STEM jobs.{{sfn|Graham|Smith|2005}}{{sfn|Perrucci|1970}}{{sfn|Hersh|2000}} Moreover, it has also been stated that traditionally stereotypical images of engineering as \u201cdirty\u201d, \u201crugged\u201d, or \u201cmanly\u201d jobs are gradually being eroded\u2014opening employment opportunities for prospective women nationwide.{{sfn|Preston|1994}}{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}}{{sfn|Bona|Kelly|Jung|2010}}\n\nHowever, recent evidence suggests that gender discrimination is still a significant issue affecting women\u2019s confidence and performance in STEM careers. According to Logel, interacting with [[sexist]] men may trigger a stressed-induced phenomenon called \u201csocial identity threat\u201d in women.{{sfn|Logel|Walton|Spencer|Iserman|2009}} Women engineers who faced regular exposure to sexist men on the job were said perform worse on aptitude tests than women who weren't exposed to such individuals. While women who worked in low-[[stress (psychological)|stress]] environments reported higher levels of confidence and [[self-actualization|self-fulfillment]], discriminated women were reportedly more likely to suppress their feelings and/or let their problems go unannounced.{{sfn|Logel|Walton|Spencer|Iserman|2009}} Such behavior is said to be detrimental to both the women engineers themselves and the workplace, where sexist behavior is likely to persist.\n\n==Initiatives to promote engineering to women==\n\nAs science and engineering have become more pervasive in [[society]], women's participation rates in these fields have not seen a proportionate increase.{{sfn|Rossi|1965}}{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} According to Cuny and Aspray, this may potentially result in a lack of women's [[aptitude|talent]] in the fields, which may further reduce employment opportunities for both employer and employee{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} In order to make engineering more appealing to young women, a broader acceptance criteria into such programs has been proposed.{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}} Specifically, admissions boards are encouraged to take other admissions factors into account such as: [[extracurricular]] accomplishments, applicants' desire to be admitted into the program, and [[communication skills]]. Additionally, it has been strongly suggested that admissions boards prioritize ethnic diversity.{{sfn|Cuny|Aspray|2002}}<ref name=autogenerated19>Milgrim, 2011{{full|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\nResearch has revealed that [[high school]]- and college-age women commonly see the STEM environment as a \"chilly, male-dominated\" environment that is highly impersonal and unsympathetic to women's unique needs.{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Vrcelj|Krishnan|2008}}{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}}{{sfn|Bona|Kelly|Jung|2010}} \"Social [[coping (psychology)|coping]]\" has thus been a mechanism which has been cited to help women deal with the challenges and [[stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with engineering's rigorous coursework and careers.{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}} [[Multiple regression]] analysis has revealed that high levels of social coping were a stronger predictor of commitment to staying in engineering studies for women than men. Put more simply, women who used social coping were less likely than men (who were actually found to be ''more'' likely) to drop out of college engineering programs. Consequently, school [[teacher]]s, staff, parents, and other figures have been encouraged to provide a more accommodating environment for social coping.{{sfn|Morganson|Jones|Major|2010}}<ref name=autogenerated19/>\n\nAn increase in influential female role models has also been cited as a way to increase women's engineering enrollment rates.{{sfn|Bona|Kelly|Jung|2010}} [[Survey methodology|survey]]s collected among 141 female engineering students across the country have shown that many women who placed high confidence levels in their math and science ability also had parents who modeled less traditional [[gender roles]]. Thus, to increase women's enrollment and retention rates in engineering, scholars have suggested that a de-emphasis away from the highly popularized \"[[nuclear family]]\" model is crucial.{{sfn|Polachek|1978}}{{sfn|Haines|Wallace|2002}}{{sfn|Goldman|Hewitt|1976}} The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was established in May 27, 1950<ref name=\":0\" /> by [[Elsie Eaves]] as a non-profit educational and service organization that attempted both to raise awareness of female engineers and increase their enrollment rates.{{fact|date=March 2020}} SWE held their first meeting with 50 engineers at Cooper Union in NJ.<ref name=\":0\" /> With membership now exceeding 17,000 members in over 300 student organizations across the United States, the SWE's principal aims are to inform female students about opportunities in the field of engineering and to encourage female engineers to attain high levels of achievement.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Notable American women engineers (in alphabetical order)==\n\n* [[Nora Stanton Blatch Barney]] (1883\u20131971) \u2013 The first woman to receive a degree in civil engineering from [[Cornell University]], in 1905, when she was also accepted as a junior member of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].
