The movement is often over long distances and from one country to another, but [[internal migration]] is also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form globally.<ref>''[https://www.iom.int/wmr/ World Migration Report 2020]''. International Organization for Migration, 2019. \"The great majority of people in the world do not migrate across borders; much larger numbers migrate within countries (an estimated 740 million internal migrants in 2009)\" (p. 19). \"In 2019, there were an estimated 272 million international migrants globally (3.5% of the world\u2019s population) ....  it is evident that the vast majority of people continue to live in the countries in which they were born\" (p. 21).</ref> People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in [[Mass migration|large groups]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals |title= Migrations country wise |accessdate= 7 June 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160211025416/http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals#/USA/arrivals |archive-date= 2016-02-11 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref> There are four major forms of migration: invasion, conquest, colonization and immigration.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

A person who is seeking refuge in another country can, if the reason for leaving the home country is political, religious, or another form of persecution, make a formal application to that country where refuge is sought and is then usually described as an [[asylum seeker]]. If this application is successful this person's legal status becomes that of a [[refugee]].\n\nIn contemporary times, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas.The analysis of migration behaviour can be helpful in assessing  the pattern of human mobility and is useful in situations such as epidemics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kumar |first1=Ankush |title=Modeling geographical spread of COVID-19 in India using network-based approach |journal=MedRxiv |date=2020 |doi=https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.20076489}}</ref>\n==Definitions==\n\nThe distinction between involuntary (fleeing political conflict or natural disaster) and voluntary migration (economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]]) is difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated.

Sociocultural contributions occur in the following areas of societies: food/cuisine, sport, music, art/culture, ideas and beliefs; civic-political contributions relate to participation in civic duties in the context of accepted authority of the State.<ref>McAuliffe, Kitimbo & Khadria, 2019, 'Reflections on migrations' contributions in an era of increasing disruption and disinformation', World Migration Report 2020, IOM: Geneva.</ref>\n\n==Voluntary migration==\n\nMigration is usually divided into two categories: '''voluntary migration''' and '''forced migration'''. \n\nVoluntary migration is based on the initiative and the free will of the person and is influenced by a combination of factors: economic, political and social: either in the migrants` country of origin (determinant factors or \"push factors\") or in the country of destination (attraction factors or \"pull factors\"). \n\n\"Push-pull factors\" are the reasons that push or attract people to a particular place. \"Push\" factors are the negative aspects of the country of origin, often decisive in people`s choice to emigrate and the \"pull\" factors are the positive aspects of a different country that encourages people to emigrate in search of a better life. Although the push-pull factors are apparently diametrically opposed, both are sides of the same coin, being equally important. Although specific to forced migration, any other harmful factor can be considered a \"push factor\" or determinant / trigger factor, such examples being: poor quality of life, lack of jobs, excessive pollution, hunger, drought or natural disasters. Such conditions represent decisive reasons for voluntary migration, the population preferring to migrate in order to prevent financially unfavorable situations or even emotional and physical suffering. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tataru|first=Georgiana|date=2020-01-14|title=Migration \u2013 an Overview on Terminology, Causes and Effects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338590488_Migration_-_an_Overview_on_Terminology_Causes_and_Effects|journal=Logos Universality Mentality Education Novelty: Law|volume=7|pages=10\u201329|doi=10.18662/lumenlaw/24|doi-access=free}}</ref>\u00a0\n\n==Forced migration==\n\nThere exist contested definitions of \"forced migration\". However, the editors of a leading scientific journal on the subject, the Forced Migration Review, offer the following definition: \nForced migration refers to the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (displaced by conflict) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects. <ref>Forced Migration Review, see https://www.fmreview.org/</ref>\n\nBy the end of 2018, there were an estimated 67.2 million forced migrants globally - 25.9 million refugees displaced from their countries, and 41.3 million internally displaced persons that had been displaced within their countries for different reasons. <ref>IOM's World Migration Report 2020, see https://publications.iom.int/books/world-migration-report-2020</ref>\n\n==Labor migration theories in the 21st century==\n\n===Overview===\n\nNumerous causes impel migrants to move to another country.

The long-term trend shows a gradual increase in academic publishing on migration, which is likely to be related to both the general expansion of academic literature production, and the increased prominence of migration research.<ref>IOM. 'Chapter 4: Migration research and analysis: Growth, reach and recent contributions.' World Migration Report 2020. p.127. https://www.iom.int/wmr/2020/chapter/04</ref>\n\n===Neoclassical economic theory===\n{{main|Neoclassical economics}}\n\nThis theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\" />\n\n===Dual labor market theory===\n\nDual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===New economics of labor migration===\n\nThis theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/> Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers\u2019 ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]] |title=Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration |date=April 2012 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Greg |last=Kaplan |first2=Sam |last2=Schulhofer-Wohl |pages=58}}</ref> Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labor reallocation.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]] |title=The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation |date=29 November 2010 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Morris |last=Davis |first2=Jonas |last2=Fisher |first3=Marcelo |last3=Veracierto |pages=50}}</ref>\n\n===Relative deprivation theory===\n{{main|Relative deprivation}}\nRelative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===World systems theory===\n\n[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===\n\nOld migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)<ref>Djelti S, \"The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants\" draft paper pr\u00e9sented in the international conference on \u201cCrossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development\u201d, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco \u2013 March 2\u20134, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper</ref> studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)<ref>Djelti S, \"Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration\" Revue Alg\u00e9rienne d\u2019Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N\u00b0: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration</ref> explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].\n\n==Sociological and political science theories==\n\n===Sociology===\n{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology| sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization) |race]] and [[Ethnic group| ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: \n\n* [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level\n* [[social conflict theory]], which examines migration through the prism of competition for [[Power (social and political) | power]] and [[resource]]s\n* [[structural functionalism]] (based on the ideas of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]), which examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie |despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s\n\nMore recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} as attention has shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.<ref>{{Cite book|url=

The following was a standard list after [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|Ravenstein's]] (1834\u20131913) proposal in the 1880s. The laws are as follows:\n\n# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''\n# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.\n# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.\n# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.\n# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.\n# ''most migrants are adults.\n# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.\n# ''migration stage by stage ([[step migration]]).''\n# ''urban rural difference.\n# ''migration and technology.\n# ''economic condition.\n\n===Lee===\nLee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors.

People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term \"migratory domino effect\" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, 2012</ref>\n\n===Other models===\n* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''<ref>Idyorough, 2008</ref>  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.\n* [[Zipf's law|Zipf's inverse distance law]] (1956)\n* [[Gravity model of migration]] and the [[friction of distance]]\n* [[Radiation law for human mobility]]\n* [[Buffer theory]]\n* Stouffer's [[theory of intervening opportunities]] (1940)\n* [[Zelinsky Model|Zelinsky's Mobility Transition Model]] (1971)\n* Bauder's regulation of [[labour economics|labour markets]] (2006) \"suggests that the international migration of workers is necessary for the survival of industrialised economies...[It] turns the conventional view of international migration on its head: it investigates how migration regulates labour markets, rather than labour markets shaping migration flows.\"<ref>Bauder, Harald.

And yet, somewhat paradoxically, the majority of migration governance has historically remained with individual States, their policies and regulations on migration typically made at the national level.<ref> McAuliffe, M. and A.M. Goossens. 2018. Regulating international migration in an era of increasing interconnectedness. In:Handbook of Migration and Globalisation (A. Triandafyllidou, ed.). Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham/Northampton, pp. 86\u2013104. </ref> For the most part, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas. The 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (Refugee Convention) are two significant examples, notable for being widely ratified. Other migration conventions have not been so broadly accepted, such as the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which still has no traditional countries of destination among its States parties. Beyond this, there have been numerous multilateral and global initiatives, dialogues and processes on migration over several decades. The [[Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration]] ([[Global Compact for Migration]]) is another milestone, as the first internationally negotiated statement of objectives for migration governance striking a balance between migrants\u2019 rights and the principle of States\u2019 sovereignty over their territory. Although it is not legally binding, the Global Compact for Migration was adopted by consensus in December 2018 at a United Nations conference in which more than 150 [[United Nations Member States]] participated and, later that same month, in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA), by a vote among the Member States of 152 to 5 (with 12 abstentions).<ref>IOM.

A person who is seeking refuge in another country can, if the reason for leaving the home country is political, religious, or another form of persecution, make a formal application to that country where refuge is sought and is then usually described as an [[asylum seeker]]. If this application is successful this person's legal status becomes that of a [[refugee]].\n\nIn contemporary times, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nThe distinction between involuntary (fleeing political conflict or natural disaster) and voluntary migration (economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]]) is difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated.

Sociocultural contributions occur in the following areas of societies: food/cuisine, sport, music, art/culture, ideas and beliefs; civic-political contributions relate to participation in civic duties in the context of accepted authority of the State.<ref>McAuliffe, Kitimbo & Khadria, 2019, 'Reflections on migrations' contributions in an era of increasing disruption and disinformation', World Migration Report 2020, IOM: Geneva.</ref>\n\n==Voluntary migration==\n\nMigration is usually divided into two categories: '''voluntary migration''' and '''forced migration'''. \n\nVoluntary migration is based on the initiative and the free will of the person and is influenced by a combination of factors: economic, political and social: either in the migrants` country of origin (determinant factors or \"push factors\") or in the country of destination (attraction factors or \"pull factors\"). \n\n\"Push-pull factors\" are the reasons that push or attract people to a particular place. \"Push\" factors are the negative aspects of the country of origin, often decisive in people`s choice to emigrate and the \"pull\" factors are the positive aspects of a different country that encourages people to emigrate in search of a better life. Although the push-pull factors are apparently diametrically opposed, both are sides of the same coin, being equally important. Although specific to forced migration, any other harmful factor can be considered a \"push factor\" or determinant / trigger factor, such examples being: poor quality of life, lack of jobs, excessive pollution, hunger, drought or natural disasters. Such conditions represent decisive reasons for voluntary migration, the population preferring to migrate in order to prevent financially unfavorable situations or even emotional and physical suffering. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tataru|first=Georgiana|date=2020-01-14|title=Migration \u2013 an Overview on Terminology, Causes and Effects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338590488_Migration_-_an_Overview_on_Terminology_Causes_and_Effects|journal=Logos Universality Mentality Education Novelty: Law|volume=7|pages=10\u201329|doi=10.18662/lumenlaw/24|doi-access=free}}</ref>\u00a0\n\n==Forced migration==\n\nThere exist contested definitions of \"forced migration\". However, the editors of a leading scientific journal on the subject, the Forced Migration Review, offer the following definition: \nForced migration refers to the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (displaced by conflict) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects. <ref>Forced Migration Review, see https://www.fmreview.org/</ref>\n\nBy the end of 2018, there were an estimated 67.2 million forced migrants globally - 25.9 million refugees displaced from their countries, and 41.3 million internally displaced persons that had been displaced within their countries for different reasons. <ref>IOM's World Migration Report 2020, see https://publications.iom.int/books/world-migration-report-2020</ref>\n\n==Labor migration theories in the 21st century==\n\n===Overview===\n\nNumerous causes impel migrants to move to another country.

The long-term trend shows a gradual increase in academic publishing on migration, which is likely to be related to both the general expansion of academic literature production, and the increased prominence of migration research.<ref>IOM. 'Chapter 4: Migration research and analysis: Growth, reach and recent contributions.' World Migration Report 2020. p.127. https://www.iom.int/wmr/2020/chapter/04</ref>\n\n===Neoclassical economic theory===\n{{main|Neoclassical economics}}\n\nThis theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\" />\n\n===Dual labor market theory===\n\nDual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===New economics of labor migration===\n\nThis theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/> Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers\u2019 ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]] |title=Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration |date=April 2012 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Greg |last=Kaplan |first2=Sam |last2=Schulhofer-Wohl |pages=58}}</ref> Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labor reallocation.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]] |title=The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation |date=29 November 2010 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Morris |last=Davis |first2=Jonas |last2=Fisher |first3=Marcelo |last3=Veracierto |pages=50}}</ref>\n\n===Relative deprivation theory===\n{{main|Relative deprivation}}\nRelative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===World systems theory===\n\n[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===\n\nOld migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)<ref>Djelti S, \"The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants\" draft paper pr\u00e9sented in the international conference on \u201cCrossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development\u201d, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco \u2013 March 2\u20134, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper</ref> studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)<ref>Djelti S, \"Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration\" Revue Alg\u00e9rienne d\u2019Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N\u00b0: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration</ref> explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].\n\n==Sociological and political science theories==\n\n===Sociology===\n{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology| sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization) |race]] and [[Ethnic group| ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: \n\n* [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level\n* [[social conflict theory]], which examines migration through the prism of competition for [[Power (social and political) | power]] and [[resource]]s\n* [[structural functionalism]] (based on the ideas of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]), which examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie |despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s\n\nMore recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} as attention has shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.<ref>{{Cite book|url=

The following was a standard list after [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|Ravenstein's]] (1834\u20131913) proposal in the 1880s. The laws are as follows:\n\n# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''\n# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.\n# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.\n# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.\n# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.\n# ''most migrants are adults.\n# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.\n# ''migration stage by stage ([[step migration]]).''\n# ''urban rural difference.\n# ''migration and technology.\n# ''economic condition.\n\n===Lee===\nLee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavourable about the area that one lives in, and pull factors are things that attract one to another area.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 2060063|title= A Theory of Migration|journal= Demography|author= Everett S.

People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term \"migratory domino effect\" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, 2012</ref>\n\n===Other models===\n* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''<ref>Idyorough, 2008</ref>  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.\n* [[Zipf's law|Zipf's inverse distance law]] (1956)\n* [[Gravity model of migration]] and the [[friction of distance]]\n* [[Radiation law for human mobility]]\n* [[Buffer theory]]\n* Stouffer's [[theory of intervening opportunities]] (1940)\n* [[Zelinsky Model|Zelinsky's Mobility Transition Model]] (1971)\n* Bauder's regulation of [[labour economics|labour markets]] (2006) \"suggests that the international migration of workers is necessary for the survival of industrialised economies...[It] turns the conventional view of international migration on its head: it investigates how migration regulates labour markets, rather than labour markets shaping migration flows.\"<ref>Bauder, Harald. ''Labour Movement: How Migration Regulates Labour Markets''. Oxford University Press, 1st edition, February 2006, English, 288 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-19-518088-6}}</ref>\n\n==Migration governance==\nBy their very nature, international migration and displacement are transnational issues concerning origin and destination States, as well as States through which migrants may travel (often referred to as \u201ctransit\u201d States) or in which they are hosted following displacement across national borders. And yet, somewhat paradoxically, the majority of migration governance has historically remained with individual States, their policies and regulations on migration typically made at the national level.<ref> McAuliffe, M. and A.M. Goossens. 2018. Regulating international migration in an era of increasing interconnectedness. In:Handbook of Migration and Globalisation (A. Triandafyllidou, ed.). Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham/Northampton, pp. 86\u2013104. </ref> For the most part, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas. The 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (Refugee Convention) are two significant examples, notable for being widely ratified. Other migration conventions have not been so broadly accepted, such as the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which still has no traditional countries of destination among its States parties. Beyond this, there have been numerous multilateral and global initiatives, dialogues and processes on migration over several decades. The [[Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration]] ([[Global Compact for Migration]]) is another milestone, as the first internationally negotiated statement of objectives for migration governance striking a balance between migrants\u2019 rights and the principle of States\u2019 sovereignty over their territory. Although it is not legally binding, the Global Compact for Migration was adopted by consensus in December 2018 at a United Nations conference in which more than 150 [[United Nations Member States]] participated and, later that same month, in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA), by a vote among the Member States of 152 to 5 (with 12 abstentions).<ref>IOM.
