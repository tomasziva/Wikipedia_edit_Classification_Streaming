RanGDP is converted into RanGTP through the action of [[RCC1]], the [[nucleotide exchange factor]] for Ran. RCC1 is also known as RanGEF (Ran Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor). Ran's intrinsic [[GTPase]]-activity is activated through interaction with Ran [[GTPase activating protein]] (RanGAP), facilitated by complex formation with Ran-binding protein (RanBP). GTPase-activation leads to the conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP, thus closing the Ran cycle.\n\nRan can diffuse freely within the cell, but because RCC1 and RanGAP are located in different places in the cell, the concentration of RanGTP and RanGDP differs locally as well, creating concentration gradients that act as signals for other cellular processes. RCC1 is bound to [[chromatin]] and therefore located inside the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. RanGAP is [[cytoplasmic]] in yeast and bound to the [[nuclear envelope]] in plants and animals. In mammalian cells, it is [[SUMO protein|SUMO]] modified and attached to the cytoplasmic side of the [[nuclear pore complex]] via interaction with the [[nucleoporin]] [[RANBP2]] (Nup358). This difference in location of the accessory proteins in the Ran cycle leads to a high RanGTP to RanGDP ratio inside the nucleus and an inversely low RanGTP to RanGDP ratio outside the nucleus.  In addition to a gradient of the nucleotide bound state of Ran, there is a gradient of the protein itself, with a higher concentration of Ran in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm.  Cytoplasmic RanGDP is imported into the nucleus by the small protein [[NUTF2]] (Nuclear Transport Factor 2), where RCC1 can then catalyze exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran.\n\n=== Role in nuclear transport during interphase ===\n\n''[[Image:RanGTPcycle.png|thumb|left|Ran cycle involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport at the nuclear pore]]\nRan is involved in the transport of proteins across the nuclear envelope by interacting with [[karyopherin]]s and changing their ability to bind or release cargo molecules. Cargo proteins containing a [[nuclear localization signal]] (NLS) are bound by [[importin]]s and transported into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP binds to importin and releases the import cargo. Cargo that needs to get out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm binds to [[exportin]] in a ternary complex with RanGTP.

In [[telophase]], RanGTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange are required for [[vesicle fusion]] at the reforming nuclear envelopes of the daughter nuclei.\n\n=== Ran and the androgen receptor ===\n\nRAN is an [[androgen receptor]] (AR) [[coactivator (genetics)|coactivator]] (ARA24) that binds differentially with different lengths of [[polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine]] within the androgen receptor. Polyglutamine repeat expansion in the AR is linked to [[spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy]] (Kennedy's disease). RAN coactivation of the AR diminishes with polyglutamine expansion within the AR, and this weak coactivation may lead to partial androgen insensitivity during the development of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.<ref name=\"pmid10400640\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hsiao PW, Lin DL, Nakao R, Chang C | title = The linkage of Kennedy's neuron disease to ARA24, the first identified androgen receptor polyglutamine region-associated coactivator | journal = J.
