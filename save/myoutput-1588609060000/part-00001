After the University moved to its new home at Rumelifeneri, the Istinye campus was remodelled to serve as a high-end conference and training center. Other Ko\u00e7 University campuses and locations include West Campus dormitories and residences (Rumelifenri, Sariyer), Ko\u00e7 University Hospital (Topkapi, Istanbul), ANAMED (Beyo\u011flu, Istanbul), KWorks (\u015ei\u015fli, Istanbul), AKMED (Antalya), and VEKAM (Ankara).\n\nThe Ko\u00e7 University Suna K\u0131ra\u00e7 Library has five branches and holds some 322,000 print volumes plus nearly 160,000 ebooks and 64,000 online serial titles. The Library also holds about 2,000 rare materials in the areas of Ottoman and European history, literature and religion.\n\n=== Architecture ===\nKo\u00e7 University's Rumelifeneri campus was designed by prominent Boston based American-Iranian architect Mozhan Khadem. Khadem is the chief design architect of all Ko\u00e7 University buildings as well as the master planner of its campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdcintl.com/news.htm|title=BDC - NEWS|website=www.bdcintl.com|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Khadem, the architecture of the campus was inspired by light and the significance of the University's geographical location on the border between Europe and Asia. Khadem also sites inspiration from Turkish artistic and poetic heritage, the works of the Sufi poet Rumi, and Turkish and Ottoman architectural styles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/architecture-koc-university|title=The Architecture Of Ko\u00e7 University {{!}} Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi|website=www.ku.edu.tr|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe campus is laid out along an east\u2013west axis: architecturally the University represents a \u2018gateway of knowledge and light\u2019, symbolized by the University's \u2018Portal of Knowledge\u2019 \u2013 the campus's arched main entrance represents both a gateway of knowledge and a gateway between East and West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://25.ku.edu.tr/the-portal-of-the-sun/?lang=en|title=The Portal of the Sun \u2013 Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi 25. y\u0131l|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> Situated among hills overlooking the Black Sea, the stepped architecture allows the campus to integrate within the steep contours of the surrounding terrain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archnet.org/sites/5103/media_contents/46686|title=Ko\u00e7 University {{!}} Campus master plan|website=Archnet|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe campus consists of a series of connected buildings surrounding a variety of interlocking courtyards. These courtyards draw on Ottoman architectural tradition and are replete with symbols of Turkish history and culture.\n\nThe campus is compact and designed for pedestrians. Students and staff can move from place to place either through open courtyards or under cover. The campus utilizes a four by four meter modular design to accommodate different spatial needs.\n\nThe final stage of the Rumelifeneri campus construction plan was realized in 2018 with the completion of a sixth faculty building, an extension to the library, and several new dormitory buildings. \n<br /><gallery>\nFile:Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi Ana Kamp\u00fcs Bilim Kap\u0131s\u0131.JPG|The Portal of Knowledge\nFile:Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi.jpg|Sunrise at Ko\u00e7 University\nFile:Ko\u00e7University1.jpg|The Clock Tower\nFile:Ko\u00e7University2.jpg|Main plaza and Student Union\nFile:Ko\u00e7University4.jpg|Main campus interior\nFile:Koc University - Engineering Faculty - 2.jpg|Rahmi M.

After the University moved to its new home at Rumelifeneri, the Istinye campus was remodelled to serve as a high-end conference and training center. Other Ko\u00e7 University campuses and locations include West Campus dormitories and residences (Rumelifenri, Sariyer), Ko\u00e7 University Hospital (Topkapi, Istanbul), ANAMED (Beyo\u011flu, Istanbul), KWorks (\u015ei\u015fli, Istanbul), AKMED (Antalya), and VEKAM (Ankara).\n\nThe Ko\u00e7 University Suna K\u0131ra\u00e7 Library has five branches and holds some 322,000 print volumes plus nearly 160,000 ebooks and 64,000 online serial titles. The Library also holds about 2,000 rare materials in the areas of Ottoman and European history, literature and religion.\n\n=== Architecture ===\nKo\u00e7 University's Rumelifeneri campus was designed by prominent Boston based American-Iranian architect Mozhan Khadem. Khadem is the chief design architect of all Ko\u00e7 University buildings as well as the master planner of its campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdcintl.com/news.htm|title=BDC - NEWS|website=www.bdcintl.com|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> \n\nAccording to Khadem, the architecture of the campus was inspired by light and the significance of the University's geographical location on the border between Europe and Asia. Khadem also sites inspiration from Turkish artistic and poetic heritage, the works of the Sufi poet Rumi, and Turkish and Ottoman architectural styles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/architecture-koc-university|title=The Architecture Of Ko\u00e7 University {{!}} Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi|website=www.ku.edu.tr|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe campus is laid out along an east\u2013west axis: architecturally the University represents a \u2018gateway of knowledge and light\u2019, symbolized by the University's \u2018Portal of Knowledge\u2019 \u2013 the campus's arched main entrance represents both a gateway of knowledge and a gateway between East and West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://25.ku.edu.tr/the-portal-of-the-sun/?lang=en|title=The Portal of the Sun \u2013 Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi 25. y\u0131l|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> Situated among hills overlooking the Black Sea, the stepped architecture allows the campus to integrate within the steep contours of the surrounding terrain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archnet.org/sites/5103/media_contents/46686|title=Ko\u00e7 University {{!}} Campus master plan|website=Archnet|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe campus consists of a series of connected buildings surrounding a variety of interlocking courtyards. These courtyards draw on Ottoman architectural tradition and are replete with symbols of Turkish history and culture.\n\nThe campus is compact and designed for pedestrians. Students and staff can move from place to place either through open courtyards or under cover. The campus utilizes a four by four meter modular design to accommodate different spatial needs.\n\nThe final stage of the Rumelifeneri campus construction plan was realized in 2018 with the completion of a sixth faculty building, an extension to the library, and several new dormitory buildings. \n<br /><gallery>\nFile:Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi Ana Kamp\u00fcs Bilim Kap\u0131s\u0131.JPG|The Portal of Knowledge\nFile:Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi.jpg|Sunrise at Ko\u00e7 University\nFile:Ko\u00e7University1.jpg|The Clock Tower\nFile:Ko\u00e7University2.jpg|Main plaza and Student Union\nFile:Ko\u00e7University4.jpg|Main campus interior\nFile:Koc University - Engineering Faculty - 2.jpg|Rahmi M.
