It shared the old hospital site on the north side of Longport, along with the equivalent for boys (which became [[Chaucer School, Canterbury|Chaucer School]]) and the Technical College (which became [[Canterbury College, Kent|Canterbury College]]). It moved across the road to the present site in 1945.\n\nPast Headmistresses were Miss E. Blackith  (who retired in 1967) and followed by Mrs V. Arnold.\n\nOn 1 September 2011, Barton Court Grammar School became an Academy. Barton Court did not change its name as it wished to keep it the same.\n\n== Campus ==\nThe school stands on what was the farm of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] across the road; 'Barton' stems from 'bere tun' or 'barley enclosure'.  The school is built around the lake in which the monks of the Abbey farmed fish.  The campus has the sixth [[Ginkgo]] tree to be introduced in England from China. The other five were planted in [[Kew Gardens]].\n\nThe main house of the school was built in 1750 as a manor house with the name 'Barton Manor'; the other buildings include a 1961 block, which is now the hall and corridor, a language block in 2001 and technology classrooms in 2007.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Curriculum ==\nFrom  September 2007 the school replaced [[A-levels]] with the [[International Baccalaureate]]. From September 2011 the school re-introduced A-levels  but kept the International Baccalaureate, giving students the option to do either. The school currently holds a Foreign Language College status, and the school has transferred to the International Baccalaureate award scheme for those pupils in Years 12 and 13.
