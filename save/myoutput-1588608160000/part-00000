They were also Special Correspondents for the British newspaper ''[[Daily Express]]''. As Claude himself describes their role: \"As for Alice and myself, we went out essentially as writers, though we were prepared to turn our hands to odd jobs if called upon to do so.  We had assisted Dr. Hartnell Beavis in London with the formation of the unit, the raising of funds, and the collection of stores.

By sometime in May, after finishing and arranging the publication of ''The Stricken Land'', Claude was back with the Serbian army \u2013 now at Salonika (as [[Thessaloniki]] was then called in English), where he was working out of its Press Bureau.  But Alice remained in London to give birth to her third child, who was born towards the end of July 1916.  She was also spending the time in England soliciting support for the relief work with Serbia.  But in October she also returned to the theatre of war and was with her husband Claude in Salonika until about the end of April of the following year, when she went to Corfu to work with the Serbian Red Cross there, under Colonel Borissavljevitch.<ref>Letter, dated 22 March 1917, which Claude Askew wrote to his niece in London, with the return address: \"Press Bureau, Headquarters, Serbian army, Salonica\", in which he wrote: \"Alice left this part of the world about three weeks ago.  She has gone to Corfu where she is busy working for Colonel Borissavljevitch, President of the Serbian Red Cross \u2013 her address is care of him.  I was anxious for her, in those days of submarines, until I heard she had safely arrived \u2013 that was by telegram \u2013 I have no letter from her yet, but it takes as long for a letter to get here from Corfu as from England.  If I can get leave, which is very doubtful, I may join her later on for a month, but one cannot see into the future and all sorts of things may happen out here.\" \"This letter is among the family artifacts now in my possession \u2013 previously in that of G.M.A.\" \u2014R.C.A.</ref>\n\n==Deaths==\n[[File:Alice askew grave.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Alice Askew's tombstone]]\n\nSometime before the end of September 1917, Alice and Claude were on leave in [[Italy]] \u2013 very likely in [[Rome]], where they were hoping to meet up with their two older children.<ref>Letter, dated 19 July 1917, which Alice Askew wrote to her friend, Miss Mildred Watson in London, with the return address (in French):\"Care of Colonel Borissavljevitch, President [[Serbian Red Cross]], Corfu\", in which she wrote: \"I am hoping to see Geoffrey & Joan, last October makes it nearly nine months since I saw the children & I am longing to have them with me for a month.

Claude had sent a telegram, dated 30 September 1917, to his older brother Hugh Askew in London, in which he wrote: \"We are leaving tonight to return to Corfu.\" They most likely travelled from Rome directly to the southern port of [[Taranto]] in [[Apulia]], where they could embark on the Italian steamer ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' bound for Corfu. It has been reported that the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' left Taranto on 4 October to stop en route at the nearby port of [[Gallipoli, Apulia|Gallipoli]] - also in Apulia, from where it departed for Corfu at 6:30 in the evening of the next day. Then, during the early hours of 6 October 1917, when it had almost reached its destination, the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' suffered a fatal torpedo attack from a German submarine, [[SM UB-48]], under the command of Wolfgang Steinbauer.<ref name=news /><ref>[http://www.pietrigrandeguerra.it/voci-e-volti-dal-fronte-2/affondamenti-navi-grande-guerra-1917-1918/ Affondamenti navi Grande Guerra 1917-1918] Web site on Italian ships sunk during the First World War - this page covering the period 1917-18</ref><ref>[http://www.lavocedelmarinaio.com/2016/10/4-10-1917-il-triste-epilogo-del-piroscafo-citta-di-bari/ '4.10.1917, il triste epilogo del piroscafo Citt\u00e0 di Bari'] Web site in Italian containing the story by Prof. Giovanni Vern\u00ec \u2013 LA VERA STORIA del triste epilogo del piroscafo \u201cCitt\u00e0 di Bari\u201d, silurato dal SMG tedesco UB48 - \"The True Story\" of the sinking of the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' including the recollections of a survivor.</ref> Another source tells us that it was on 4 October and \"about 37 miles from Paxo\" (or [[Paxoi]]) where the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' was sunk.<ref>[http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1286.html Ships hit during WWI - Citta Di Bari] Web site on \"all the German U-boats of both World Wars\" - this page showing the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' as one of the ships hit during WWI.</ref> Both drowned in the incident.<ref name=death /><ref name=probate /> Claude's body was never recovered, but on 29 October the body of a woman was \"found on the seashore at Porto Karboni on the island of [[Kor\u010dula]]\" by a local fisherman.<ref name=\"translation\">Translation of an original document sent \"To the Imperial Royal District Authorities (Bezirkshauptmannschaft), Kor\u010dula (Curzola), Velaluka, 6 November 1917 ...

They were also Special Correspondents for the British newspaper ''[[Daily Express]]''. As Claude himself describes their role: \"As for Alice and myself, we went out essentially as writers, though we were prepared to turn our hands to odd jobs if called upon to do so.  We had assisted Dr. Hartnell Beavis in London with the formation of the unit, the raising of funds, and the collection of stores. It was the reports in the English Press of the terrible state into which Serbia had fallen during the winter of 1914\u20131915 that first inspired us to work for that gallant little country.\"  He wrote this in their personal account of their experiences and impressions accompanying the Serbian army on its famous 'Great Retreat' across the mountains from [[Prishtina]] to [[Lezh\u00eb|Alessio]], during the winter of 1915\u201316, which was published in 1916 under the title: ''The Stricken Land: Serbia As We Saw It.''<ref>Askew, 1916, p. 17</ref> The authors had spent some six months in Serbia before the retreat and wrote with sympathy and real knowledge of Serbia and the Serbian character.<ref name=death /> Claude Askew  was given the honorary commission of a major in the Serbian army.<ref>Askew, 1916, p. 54</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|'Great Serbian Retreat']] (see: [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Serbian Campaign]]), when the bulk of the Serbian army had been evacuated to the Greek island of [[Corfu]], Alice and Claude both returned to England, which they reached by April 1916. By sometime in May, after finishing and arranging the publication of ''The Stricken Land'', Claude was back with the Serbian army \u2013 now at Salonika (as [[Thessaloniki]] was then called in English), where he was working out of its Press Bureau.  But Alice remained in London to give birth to her third child, who was born towards the end of July 1916.  She was also spending the time in England soliciting support for the relief work with Serbia.  But in October she also returned to the theatre of war and was with her husband Claude in Salonika until about the end of April of the following year, when she went to Corfu to work with the Serbian Red Cross there, under Colonel Borissavljevitch.<ref>Letter, dated 22 March 1917, which Claude Askew wrote to his niece in London, with the return address: \"Press Bureau, Headquarters, Serbian army, Salonica\", in which he wrote: \"Alice left this part of the world about three weeks ago.  She has gone to Corfu where she is busy working for Colonel Borissavljevitch, President of the Serbian Red Cross \u2013 her address is care of him.  I was anxious for her, in those days of submarines, until I heard she had safely arrived \u2013 that was by telegram \u2013 I have no letter from her yet, but it takes as long for a letter to get here from Corfu as from England.  If I can get leave, which is very doubtful, I may join her later on for a month, but one cannot see into the future and all sorts of things may happen out here.\" \"This letter is among the family artifacts now in my possession \u2013 previously in that of G.M.A.\" \u2014R.C.A.</ref>\n\n==Deaths==\n[[File:Alice askew grave.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Alice Askew's tombstone]]\n\nSometime before the end of September 1917, Alice and Claude were on leave in [[Italy]] \u2013 very likely in [[Rome]], where they were hoping to meet up with their two older children.<ref>Letter, dated 19 July 1917, which Alice Askew wrote to her friend, Miss Mildred Watson in London, with the return address (in French):\"Care of Colonel Borissavljevitch, President [[Serbian Red Cross]], Corfu\", in which she wrote: \"I am hoping to see Geoffrey & Joan, last October makes it nearly nine months since I saw the children & I am longing to have them with me for a month. I have been given a month\u2019s leave to go to Rome in the hope of meeting them there.\" \"This letter is among the family artifacts now in my possession \u2013 previously in that of G.M.A.\" \u2014R.C.A.)</ref> They probably left Rome on the last day of September to return to Corfu. Claude had sent a telegram, dated 30 September 1917, to his older brother Hugh Askew in London, in which he wrote: \"We are leaving tonight to return to Corfu.\" They most likely travelled from Rome directly to the southern port of [[Taranto]] in [[Apulia]], where they could embark on the Italian steamer ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' bound for Corfu. It has been reported that the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' left Taranto on 4 October to stop en route at the nearby port of [[Gallipoli, Apulia|Gallipoli]] - also in Apulia, from where it departed for Corfu at 6:30 in the evening of the next day. Then, during the early hours of 6 October 1917, when it had almost reached its destination, the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' suffered a fatal torpedo attack from a German submarine, [[SM UB-48]], under the command of Wolfgang Steinbauer.<ref name=news /><ref>[http://www.pietrigrandeguerra.it/voci-e-volti-dal-fronte-2/affondamenti-navi-grande-guerra-1917-1918/ Affondamenti navi Grande Guerra 1917-1918] Web site on Italian ships sunk during the First World War - this page covering the period 1917-18</ref><ref>[http://www.lavocedelmarinaio.com/2016/10/4-10-1917-il-triste-epilogo-del-piroscafo-citta-di-bari/ '4.10.1917, il triste epilogo del piroscafo Citt\u00e0 di Bari'] Web site in Italian containing the story by Prof. Giovanni Vern\u00ec \u2013 LA VERA STORIA del triste epilogo del piroscafo \u201cCitt\u00e0 di Bari\u201d, silurato dal SMG tedesco UB48 - \"The True Story\" of the sinking of the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' including the recollections of a survivor.</ref> Another source tells us that it was on 4 October and \"about 37 miles from Paxo\" (or [[Paxoi]]) where the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' was sunk.<ref>[http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1286.html Ships hit during WWI - Citta Di Bari] Web site on \"all the German U-boats of both World Wars\" - this page showing the ''Citt\u00e0 di Bari'' as one of the ships hit during WWI.</ref> Both drowned in the incident.<ref name=death /><ref name=probate /> Claude's body was never recovered, but on 29 October the body of a woman was \"found on the seashore at Porto Karboni on the island of [[Kor\u010dula]]\" by a local fisherman.<ref name=\"translation\">Translation of an original document sent \"To the Imperial Royal District Authorities (Bezirkshauptmannschaft), Kor\u010dula (Curzola), Velaluka, 6 November 1917 ...
