It includes some bad info, like for example saying that 0.277\u201d = 6.8mm.|date=October 2017}} The resulting cartridge was named the 6.8 Remington Special Purpose Cartridge due to the .270\" (6.8 mm) diameter projectile and the fact that it was based on the .30 Remington case.\n\nIn general, adapting an AR-style rifle to the new cartridge only requires the replacement of the barrel, bolt, magazine & muzzle device (if applicable) of the 5.56&nbsp;mm-chambered rifle; but to further streamline and simplify the conversion process many parts manufacturers sell complete upper receiver assemblies chambered for 6.8 SPC.  While a complete 6.8 SPC assembly is a somewhat more expensive route, the conversion of an existing 5.56&nbsp;mm/.223 rifle to 6.8 SPC using a complete upper assembly takes less than a minute on an AR-style rifle without the need for specialized tools or skills.\n\nThe 6.8mm Remington SPC was designed to perform better in short barreled [[Close Quarters Battle|CQB]] rifles after diminished performance from the 5.56 NATO when the M16A2 was changed from the rifle configuration to the current [[M4 carbine]]. The 6.8 SPC delivers 44% more energy than the 5.56mm NATO (M4 configuration) at {{convert|100|-|300|m}}. The 6.8&nbsp;mm SPC is not the ballistic equal of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge, but it has less recoil, has been said to be more controllable in rapid fire, and is lighter, allowing operators to carry more ammunition than would otherwise be possible with the larger caliber round. The 6.8&nbsp;mm generates around {{convert|1759|ftlbf|J|abbr=on|order=flip}} of muzzle energy with a {{convert|115|gr|adj=on|order=flip}} bullet. In comparison, the 5.56\u00d745mm round (which the 6.8 is designed to replace) generates around {{convert|1325|ftlbf|J|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a {{convert|62|gr|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} bullet, giving the 6.8&nbsp;mm a terminal ballistic advantage over the 5.56&nbsp;mm of {{convert|434|ftlbf|J|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\nOne of the enigmatic features of this cartridge is its being designed for a short barrel carbine length rifle than the standard rifle length is (usually {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}). The round only gains about {{convert|25|-|35|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}} for every 25&nbsp;mm of barrel length past the standard {{convert|16|in|order=flip|adj=on}} barrel (all else being equal) up to barrel's length around {{convert|22|-|24|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} with no gain/loss in accuracy. It also does very well in rifles with less than {{convert|16|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} barrels. In recent developments (the period 2008-2012) the performance of the 6.8 SPC has been increased by approximately {{convert|200|to|300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}} by the work of one ammunition manufacturer Silver State Armory LLC (SSA) and a few custom rifle builders using/designing the correct chamber and barrel specifications. The 6.8mm Remington SPC cartridge weighs depending on the manufacturer and load between {{convert|16.8|and|17.6|g|gr}}. Also, more recently, [[LWRC]], [[Magpul]] and [[Alliant Techsystems]] (ATK) are currently introducing a new AR-15 designed for the 6.8 SPC which allows for a proprietary 6.8 Magpul P-Mags and an overall cartridge length of {{convert|2.32|in|cm|order=flip}}.

Unlike smaller commercial firms, ATK is a large ammunition supplier that delivers products for the U.S. Army, so it had large resources and manufacturing capabilities at its disposal.  Commercial cartridges varied in case capacity and thickness, but LWRC wanted a thick and durable case for military uses.  A {{convert|90|gr|g|abbr=on}} load was developed specifically for a high muzzle velocity and low felt recoil from the Six8's {{convert|8.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel.  Effective range would be over {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} and the bullet would still have enough energy to penetrate intermediate barriers.  Three 90 gr loads were constructed for testing that included Gold Dot, Monolithic Hollow Point, and FMJ.  The Gold Dot bullet was selected with a {{convert|.035|in|mm|abbr=on}} jacket and a bonded core.  The propellant was designed for reduced muzzle flash stable performance at temperatures between -29.2 to 125.6 degrees F.  Muzzle velocity averaged at a {{convert|200|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} difference at the required temperature extremes from the 8.5 in barrel.  From a {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel, the round produced a group of {{convert|1.56|in|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|200|yd|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.shotgunnews.com/2012/11/09/lwrci-uciw-six8-review/ LWRCI UCIW SIX8 Review] - Shotgunnews.com, 9 November 2012</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2010 the Jordanian state-owned arms manufacturer KADDB announced that they would be producing 6.8&nbsp;mm rifles and carbines for the [[Jordanian Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/05/13/lwrc-rifles-to-be-license-produced-in-jordan/ |title=LWRC rifles to be license-produced in Jordan |publisher=Thefirearmblog.com |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  There is also a contract between [[LWRC]], [[Magpul]], [[Alliant Techsystems]] and The Saudi Royal guard for around 36,000 Six8 PDWs & undisclosed amount of ATK/Federal XD68GD (90gr Gold Dot 'training' ammo) and proprietary Magpul 6.8 Pmags specifically for the [[LWRC_M6#Six8|LWRC Six8]]. See above under the subsection 'Development' Section.\nThe 6.8 is also being produced in a Squad Automatic Weapon or SAW by U.S. Machine Gun Armory. The MGA SAW\u2122 is fully compatible with the United States Department of Defense model designations: M249 and MK46. It is currently being shipped to US allies and is under testing with the US military.\n\n===Current chamberings===\nThere are several different chambers for the 6.8 SPC which yield different results.  They are:\n\n# Original Murray 6.8\u00d743 ERC developed in 2002.\n# The [[Remington Arms|Remington]] [[SAAMI]] submitted specifications. It was supposed to have a {{convert|0.050|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore, 45\u00b0 cone angle, {{convert|0.278|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} \u2300 freebore.  The reamers and PTG prints had an 80\u00b0 neck to freebore cone angle, which was a result of a mistake in the reamer drawing submitted, and was never corrected by the reamer maker or Remington during the process of tooling up for the testing protocols that eventually drove the SAAMI submission.\n# SPC II is current standard chamber used by most barrel manufactures. It has been said to be very close to the original Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program chamber. It has a {{convert|0.100|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore, 45\u00b0 cone angle, {{convert|0.278|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} \u2300 freebore, and {{convert|0.3085|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} neck.{{updateinline|date=September 2017}}\n# Murray [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] chamber, which was meant to address improved accuracy expectations for the ERC Special Purpose Rifle program in SOCOM.\n# 6.8 ARP created by AR Performance. It has a {{convert|0.095|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore, 45\u00b0 cone angle, and a {{convert|0.2775|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} \u2300 freebore, and {{convert|0.3085|to|0.309|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} neck.\n# Noveske Mod 1 designed by Noveske Rifleworks LLC. It has been said to have a {{convert|0.100|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore.\n# Bison Armory 6.8 Bison, introduced December 2017, which decreases the freebore of the 6.8 SPC II chamber to{{convert|0.072|in||abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nOnly the rifles chambered with the newer specified chamber (6.8mm Spec II, Noveske Mod 1, 6.8 ARP, and 6.8 Bison chambers) can safely use the higher pressure military/tactical and near max-maximum handloaded ammunition. Those rifles using the Original SAAMI specs should only be used with the standard commercial cartridge pressure (Specified by SAAMI).\n\n==== Twist Rate ====\nSeveral twist rates are available for 6.8 SPC barrels. The slowest twist rates are approximately 1:12\", while twist rates between 1:9.5\" and 1:11\" are common. The de facto standard twist rate for 6.8 SPC is currently 1:11\". Bison Armory employs a twist rate of 1:7\" in some of their 16\" and shorter barrels in order to stabilize 180 to 200 grain bullets for subsonic performance similar to the 300 AAC Blackout.\n\n====Semiautomatic action====\nThe first major manufacturer to offer a 6.8mm Remington SPC chambered version of the [[AR-15]] was [[Barrett Firearms Company]], offering the [[Barrett M468]] and later the [[REC7]].  By 2007, most major manufacturers of AR-15 type rifles for the civilian gun market were offering rifles in this caliber. Dedicated AR upper receiver assemblies chambered for the round are produced by a number of smaller firms, including Daniel Defense.  Ruger Firearms no longer produces a 6.8&nbsp;mm for their [[Ruger SR-556]] piston-driven AR-15 variant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/FAProdView?model=5814&return=Y |title=Information on the 6.8 SPC Mini |publisher=Ruger-firearms.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref> The [[Stag Arms]] Hunter and Tactical models utilize the newer chamber(SPC II) and specified twist rates to accommodate higher pressure loadings, as well as upper receivers in Left-Handed configurations. Rock River Arms has a LAR-6.8 X Series rifle and uppers. [[Microtech Small Arms Research]] offers their version of the [[Steyr AUG]] in 6.8. [[Robinson Armament Co.]] offers the XCR-L in 6.8, which can be easily converted between 6.8, 5.56, and 7.62\u00d739. [[Bushmaster Firearms International|Bushmaster]] has delivered a 6.8 SPC II conversion kit to the market as of October 2018.  Ruger Firearms chambered their Mini-14 Ranch Rifle in this round for several years; however, it has been discontinued.\n\n====Manual action====\nAs of 2019, no significant firearms companies are producing a manual action firearm in 6.8 SPC. [[Remington Arms|Remington]] used to make a bolt-action rifle chambered for 6.8 SPC, a {{convert|24|in|order=flip|adj=on}} barrel [[Remington 700|Model 700]] but this item is not currently available from Remington.

It includes some bad info, like for example saying that 0.277\u201d = 6.8mm.|date=October 2017}} The resulting cartridge was named the 6.8 Remington Special Purpose Cartridge due to the .270\" (6.8 mm) diameter projectile and the fact that it was based on the .30 Remington case.\n\nIn general, adapting an AR-style rifle to the new cartridge only requires the replacement of the barrel, bolt, magazine & muzzle device (if applicable) of the 5.56&nbsp;mm-chambered rifle; but to further streamline and simplify the conversion process many parts manufacturers sell complete upper receiver assemblies chambered for 6.8 SPC.  While a complete 6.8 SPC assembly is a somewhat more expensive route, the conversion of an existing 5.56&nbsp;mm/.223 rifle to 6.8 SPC using a complete upper assembly takes less than a minute on an AR-style rifle without the need for specialized tools or skills.\n\nThe 6.8mm Remington SPC was designed to perform better in short barreled [[Close Quarters Battle|CQB]] rifles after diminished performance from the 5.56 NATO when the M16A2 was changed from the rifle configuration to the current [[M4 carbine]]. The 6.8 SPC delivers 44% more energy than the 5.56mm NATO (M4 configuration) at {{convert|100|-|300|m}}. The 6.8&nbsp;mm SPC is not the ballistic equal of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge, but it has less recoil, has been said to be more controllable in rapid fire, and is lighter, allowing operators to carry more ammunition than would otherwise be possible with the larger caliber round. The 6.8&nbsp;mm generates around {{convert|1759|ftlbf|J|abbr=on|order=flip}} of muzzle energy with a {{convert|115|gr|adj=on|order=flip}} bullet. In comparison, the 5.56\u00d745mm round (which the 6.8 is designed to replace) generates around {{convert|1325|ftlbf|J|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a {{convert|62|gr|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} bullet, giving the 6.8&nbsp;mm a terminal ballistic advantage over the 5.56&nbsp;mm of {{convert|434|ftlbf|J|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\nOne of the enigmatic features of this cartridge is its being designed for a short barrel carbine length rifle than the standard rifle length is (usually {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}). The round only gains about {{convert|25|-|35|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}} for every 25&nbsp;mm of barrel length past the standard {{convert|16|in|order=flip|adj=on}} barrel (all else being equal) up to barrel's length around {{convert|22|-|24|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} with no gain/loss in accuracy. It also does very well in rifles with less than {{convert|16|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} barrels. In recent developments (the period 2008-2012) the performance of the 6.8 SPC has been increased by approximately {{convert|200|to|300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|order=flip}} by the work of one ammunition manufacturer Silver State Armory LLC (SSA) and a few custom rifle builders using/designing the correct chamber and barrel specifications. The 6.8mm Remington SPC cartridge weighs depending on the manufacturer and load between {{convert|16.8|and|17.6|g|gr}}. Also, more recently, [[LWRC]], [[Magpul]] and [[Alliant Techsystems]] (ATK) are currently introducing a new AR-15 designed for the 6.8 SPC which allows for a proprietary 6.8 Magpul P-Mags and an overall cartridge length of {{convert|2.32|in|cm|order=flip}}.

Unlike smaller commercial firms, ATK is a large ammunition supplier that delivers products for the U.S. Army, so it had large resources and manufacturing capabilities at its disposal.  Commercial cartridges varied in case capacity and thickness, but LWRC wanted a thick and durable case for military uses.  A {{convert|90|gr|g|abbr=on}} load was developed specifically for a high muzzle velocity and low felt recoil from the Six8's {{convert|8.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel.  Effective range would be over {{convert|300|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} and the bullet would still have enough energy to penetrate intermediate barriers.  Three 90 gr loads were constructed for testing that included Gold Dot, Monolithic Hollow Point, and FMJ.  The Gold Dot bullet was selected with a {{convert|.035|in|mm|abbr=on}} jacket and a bonded core.  The propellant was designed for reduced muzzle flash stable performance at temperatures between -29.2 to 125.6 degrees F.  Muzzle velocity averaged at a {{convert|200|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} difference at the required temperature extremes from the 8.5 in barrel.  From a {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel, the round produced a group of {{convert|1.56|in|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|200|yd|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.shotgunnews.com/2012/11/09/lwrci-uciw-six8-review/ LWRCI UCIW SIX8 Review] - Shotgunnews.com, 9 November 2012</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2010 the Jordanian state-owned arms manufacturer KADDB announced that they would be producing 6.8&nbsp;mm rifles and carbines for the [[Jordanian Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/05/13/lwrc-rifles-to-be-license-produced-in-jordan/ |title=LWRC rifles to be license-produced in Jordan |publisher=Thefirearmblog.com |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  There is also a contract between [[LWRC]], [[Magpul]], [[Alliant Techsystems]] and The Saudi Royal guard for around 36,000 Six8 PDWs & undisclosed amount of ATK/Federal XD68GD (90gr Gold Dot 'training' ammo) and proprietary Magpul 6.8 Pmags specifically for the [[LWRC_M6#Six8|LWRC Six8]]. See above under the subsection 'Development' Section.\nThe 6.8 is also being produced in a Squad Automatic Weapon or SAW by U.S. Machine Gun Armory. The MGA SAW\u2122 is fully compatible with the United States Department of Defense model designations: M249 and MK46. It is currently being shipped to US allies and is under testing with the US military.\n\n===Current chamberings===\nThere are several different chambers for the 6.8 SPC which yield different results.  They are:\n\n# Original Murray 6.8\u00d743 ERC developed in 2002.\n# The [[Remington Arms|Remington]] [[SAAMI]] submitted specifications. It was supposed to have a {{convert|0.050|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore, 45\u00b0 cone angle, {{convert|0.278|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} \u2300 freebore.  The reamers and PTG prints had an 80\u00b0 neck to freebore cone angle, which was a result of a mistake in the reamer drawing submitted, and was never corrected by the reamer maker or Remington during the process of tooling up for the testing protocols that eventually drove the SAAMI submission.\n# SPC II is current standard chamber used by most barrel manufactures. It has been said to be very close to the original Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program chamber. It has a {{convert|0.100|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore, 45\u00b0 cone angle, {{convert|0.278|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} \u2300 freebore, and {{convert|0.3085|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} neck.{{updateinline|date=September 2017}}\n# Murray [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] chamber, which was meant to address improved accuracy expectations for the ERC Special Purpose Rifle program in SOCOM.\n# 6.8 ARP created by AR Performance. It has a {{convert|0.095|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore, 45\u00b0 cone angle, and a {{convert|0.2775|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} \u2300 freebore, and {{convert|0.3085|to|0.309|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} neck.\n# Noveske Mod 1 designed by Noveske Rifleworks LLC. It has been said to have a {{convert|0.100|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} freebore.\n# Bison Armory 6.8 Bison, introduced December 2017, which decreases the freebore of the 6.8 SPC II chamber to{{convert|0.072|in||abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nOnly the rifles chambered with the newer specified chamber (6.8mm Spec II, Noveske Mod 1, 6.8 ARP, and 6.8 Bison chambers) can safely use the higher pressure military/tactical and near max-maximum handloaded ammunition. Those rifles using the Original SAAMI specs should only be used with the standard commercial cartridge pressure (Specified by SAAMI).\n\n==== Twist Rate ====\nSeveral twist rates are available for 6.8 SPC barrels. The slowest twist rates are approximately 1:12\", while twist rates between 1:9.5\" and 1:11\" are common. The de facto standard twist rate for 6.8 SPC is currently 1:11\". Bison Armory employs a twist rate of 1:7\" in some of their 16\" and shorter barrels in order to stabilize 180 to 200 grain bullets for subsonic performance similar to the 300 AAC Blackout.\n\n====Semiautomatic action====\nThe first major manufacturer to offer a 6.8mm Remington SPC chambered version of the [[AR-15]] was [[Barrett Firearms Company]], offering the [[Barrett M468]] and later the [[REC7]].  By 2007, most major manufacturers of AR-15 type rifles for the civilian gun market were offering rifles in this caliber. Dedicated AR upper receiver assemblies chambered for the round are produced by a number of smaller firms, including Daniel Defense.  Ruger Firearms no longer produces a 6.8&nbsp;mm for their [[Ruger SR-556]] piston-driven AR-15 variant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/FAProdView?model=5814&return=Y |title=Information on the 6.8 SPC Mini |publisher=Ruger-firearms.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref> The [[Stag Arms]] Hunter and Tactical models utilize the newer chamber(SPC II) and specified twist rates to accommodate higher pressure loadings, as well as upper receivers in Left-Handed configurations. Rock River Arms has a LAR-6.8 X Series rifle and uppers. [[Microtech Small Arms Research]] offers their version of the [[Steyr AUG]] in 6.8. [[Robinson Armament Co.]] offers the XCR-L in 6.8, which can be easily converted between 6.8, 5.56, and 7.62\u00d739. [[Bushmaster Firearms International|Bushmaster]] has delivered a 6.8 SPC II conversion kit to the market as of October 2018.  Ruger Firearms chambered their Mini-14 Ranch Rifle in this round for several years; however, it has been discontinued.\n\n====Manual action====\nAs of 2019, no significant firearms companies are producing a manual action firearm in 6.8 SPC. [[Remington Arms|Remington]] used to make a bolt-action rifle chambered for 6.8 SPC, a {{convert|24|in|order=flip|adj=on}} barrel [[Remington 700|Model 700]] but this item is not currently available from Remington.
