The style of his memorial statues was classical and simple as they were inspired by the classical sculpture he studied in Rome. Additional influences were Michelangelo and Rubens.<ref name=ox/> In 1701 he created the [[:File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - Epitaph monument of Michiel Peeters.jpg|epitaph for Michiel Peeters]] in the St. James Church in Antwerp.  In the monument a personification of Eternity rises up like a body resurrected from the grave. The monument is carved in white marble against a black marble ground which is made to look like funerary cloth. The central figure is a personification of Eternity who is resting her right hand on a closed circle representing Eternity while her left arm is resting on a globe. The globe is a symbol of the sorrows and brevity of life on earth, which Eternity is leaving behind for the eternal joys of heaven. The style evokes the early 17th century classicizing sculptures of the Flemish sculptor [[Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy]] in its clear outlines, Classical beauty type and smooth modeling.<ref name=jeff/>\n[[File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - The erection of the Cross.jpg|thumb|''The elevation of the Cross'']]\n\nHe created in 1702 in the [[St. Rumbold's Cathedral]] in Mechelen two funeral monuments for the brothers de Precipiano. The [[:File:Mechelen Humbert-Guillaume de Precipiano 9-06-2012 14-53-08.JPG|memorial]] to [[Humbertus Guilielmus de Precipiano]], Bishop of Mechelen is traditional in design, but the artist sculpted a lively portrait in full-length marble figure of the Bishop. The [[:File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - Funeral monument of Ambrosius de Precipiano.jpg|tomb]] of the Bishop's brother Count Prosper Ambrosius de Precipiano has as its base a vast [[stele]] combined with an allegorical figure holding a shield on which a portrait bust of de Precipiano is carved.

At the end of the 17th century a new design for pulpits had emerged in Flanders.  Antwerp sculptor [[Hendrik Frans Verbruggen]] was the principal creator behind this new type of naturalist pulpit. In 1696\u20131699, Verbruggen created a [[:File:Bruxelles Co-Cath\u00e9drale St. Michel & Ste. Gudule Innen Kanzel 2.jpg|pulpit]] for the Jesuit church in Leuven, which is now located in the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] in Brussels. He turned the pulpit into a complex theatrical stage in which at the bottom Adam and Eve are shown driven out of the Earthly Paradise, while the victorious Virgin on top of the pulpit's soundboard crushes the snake slithering from the tree of Good and Evil.<ref name=tento>[https://okv.be/nl/OKV-artikel/de-baroksculptuur-en-het-barok-kerkmeubilair-de-zuidelijke-nederlanden H.

It is decorated with a myriad of plants and animals sculpted in a realistic manner. The supporting column of the pulpit consist of four figures who are representations of the Four Continents.<ref name=herck/> His most exuberant pulpit is located in the St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen.  He created it in 1721 for the abbey of Leliendael.  He transformed the structure of a traditional pulpit into a stage for a '[[tableau vivant]]'.<ref name=herck/>  The pulpit appears like a free-standing landscape in which a dramatic representation of the conversion of St Norbert takes central place.  The saint is shown being thrown from his horse underneath a small mountain.  The mountain is brimming with trees, animals and figures that emerge from the background of rough-hewn rocks.<ref name=ox/> The Calvary and the temptation of Adam and Eve are also depicted in the pulpit. The crown of the tree of Good and Evil forms its sounding board. It is no longer possible to distinguish the architectural parts from each other which have become a single whole.<ref name=tento/>\n[[File:Statues in Brussels Park - IMG 3722.JPG|thumb|left|''Charity'']]\n\nIn 1720 he executed one of his finest reliefs, the [[:File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - The erection of the Cross.jpg|''Elevation of the Cross'']] (St. James Church, Antwerp). The design is taken from Rubens' treatment of the same subject in Antwerp Cathedral.  Van der Voort achieves depth by letting figures overlap each other and lean out of the relief.<ref name=ox/>\n\nOn the outside of the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp is a group of statues referred to as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|Calvary]].  It was created on the location of an ancient Dominican cemetery by the brothers van Ketwigh who were Dominican friars.  Its design dates from 1697.  In 1734 construction of the Calvary was completed but further statues were added up to 1747. It is built as a courtyard and leans on one side against the south aisle of the church and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament.  The structure includes 63 life-size statues and nine reliefs executed in a popular and theatrical style.  Most statues are of white stone with some made of wood. Some statues are dated or signed.  The principal sculptors were Michiel Van der Voort the Elder, [[Alexander van Papenhoven]] and [[Jan Claudius de Cock]] with some statues by the hand of father and son [[Willem Kerricx]], Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder and anonymous collaborators.<ref name=kerk>[https://www.topa.be/en/antwerp/kerken-in-antwerpen/sint-paulus-2/syllabus Rudi Mannaerts, ''Saint Paul's, the Antwerp Dominican church, a revelation''], Toerismepastoraal Antwerpen</ref> The statues are arranged into four groups: the angel path, which ascends to the Holy Sepulchre, the garden of the prophets on the left, the garden of the evangelists on the right and the Calvary itself, which consists of an elevated artificial rock, divided into three terraces, on which statues are placed with Christ on the cross at the top.<ref name=oe>[https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/dibe/relict/4648 De Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed, Sint-Pauluskerk en dominicanenklooster] (ID: 4648) {{in lang|nl}}</ref>  The angels on the Calvary were directly inspired by the angels made by Bernini for the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Bridge of Angels]] in Rome in 1657.<ref name=herck/>\n[[File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - Faun making music.jpg|thumb|''Faun making music'']]\n\nHe also produced secular works, particularly of mythological subjects. An example is his ''Perseus and Andromeda'' (marble, 1746, Antwerp, Huis Osterrieth).<ref name=ox/>  In this work the virile Perseus stands beside the body of Andromeda in a carefully studied '[[contrapposto]]'. Andromeda seems not to have suffered very much. Her body leans back like a [[bacchante]] by Rubens in an almost ecstatic posture. While the group lacks drama it breathes a certain pagan joy. In the century of the Counter Reformation, full of Christian symbolism, this work shows the force of Greek antiquity as an inspiration.<ref name=acker/>   A secular work with an allegorical subject is the [[:File:Statues in Brussels Park - IMG 3722.JPG|''Charity'']] (marble, Brussels), which shows a female figure representing Charity surrounded by three children.<ref name=mster/>\n\nA number of drawings are ascribed to him.

The crown of the tree of Good and Evil forms its sounding board. It is no longer possible to distinguish the architectural parts from each other which have become a single whole.<ref name=tento/>\n[[File:Statues in Brussels Park - IMG 3722.JPG|thumb|left|''Charity'']]\n\nIn 1720 he executed one of his finest reliefs, the [[:File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - The erection of the Cross.jpg|''Elevation of the Cross'']] (St. James Church, Antwerp). The design is taken from Rubens' treatment of the same subject in Antwerp Cathedral.  Van der Voort achieves depth by letting figures overlap each other and lean out of the relief.<ref name=ox/> \n\nOn the outside of the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp is a group of statues referred to as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|Calvary]].  It was created on the location of an ancient Dominican cemetery by the brothers van Ketwigh who were Dominican friars.  Its design dates from 1697.  In 1734 construction of the Calvary was completed but further statues were added up to 1747. It is built as a courtyard and leans on one side against the south aisle of the church and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament.  The structure includes 63 life-size statues and nine reliefs executed in a popular and theatrical style.  Most statues are of white stone with some made of wood. Some statues are dated or signed.  The principal sculptors were Michiel Van der Voort the Elder, [[Alexander van Papenhoven]] and [[Jan Claudius de Cock]] with some statues by the hand of father and son [[Willem Kerricx]], Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder and anonymous collaborators.<ref name=kerk>[https://www.topa.be/en/antwerp/kerken-in-antwerpen/sint-paulus-2/syllabus Rudi Mannaerts, ''Saint Paul's, the Antwerp Dominican church, a revelation''], Toerismepastoraal Antwerpen</ref> The statues are arranged into four groups: the angel path, which ascends to the Holy Sepulchre, the garden of the prophets on the left, the garden of the evangelists on the right and the Calvary itself, which consists of an elevated artificial rock, divided into three terraces, on which statues are placed with Christ on the cross at the top.<ref name=oe>[https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/dibe/relict/4648 De Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed, Sint-Pauluskerk en dominicanenklooster] (ID: 4648) {{in lang|nl}}</ref>  The angels on the Calvary were directly inspired by the angels made by Bernini for the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Bridge of Angels]] in Rome in 1657.<ref name=herck/>\n[[File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - Faun making music.jpg|thumb|''Faun making music'']]\n\nHe also produced secular works, particularly of mythological subjects. An example is his ''Perseus and Andromeda'' (marble, 1746, Antwerp, Huis Osterrieth).<ref name=ox/>  In this work the virile Perseus stands beside the body of Andromeda in a carefully studied '[[contrapposto]]'. Andromeda seems not to have suffered very much. Her body leans back like a [[bacchante]] by Rubens in an almost ecstatic posture. While the group lacks drama it breathes a certain pagan joy. In the century of the Counter Reformation, full of Christian symbolism, this work shows the force of Greek antiquity as an inspiration.<ref name=acker/>   A secular work with an allegorical subject is the [[:File:Statues in Brussels Park - IMG 3722.JPG|''Charity'']] (marble, Brussels), which shows a female figure representing Charity surrounded by three children.<ref name=mster/>\n\nA number of drawings are ascribed to him. These include 12 preparatory sketches for the apostles in the nave of the St. Paul's Church in Antwerp (circa 1710) and a study for the portal of a Chapel of St. Eligius.<ref name=herck/>  He also made designs for the Antwerp silversmiths. He made a [[:File:Michiel van der Voort (I) - Design of a monstrance.jpg|design for a monstrance]], which was formerly attributed to the Antwerp silversmith Jan Baptiste Verberckt I.  The design shows a kneeling angel to the left and a standing figure with an anchor that symbolizes Hope to the right. He made the design for the local silversmith Wierick Somers IV who made some changes to it in the executed work.<ref name=acker/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*{{Commons-inline|Category:Michiel van der Voort (I)|Michiel van der Voort the Elder}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voort, Michiel van der 1}}\n\n[[Category:Flemish Baroque sculptors]]\n[[Category:Flemish artists (before 1830)]]\n[[Category:Artists from Antwerp]]\n[[Category:17th-century births]]\n[[Category:1667 births]]\n[[Category:1737 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: well-known \u2192 well known, 1694-95 \u2192 1694\u201395 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michiel_van_der_Voort_the_Elder"}
