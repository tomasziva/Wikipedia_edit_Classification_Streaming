The show premiered on October 11, 2008, and currently airs every Sunday from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM, on the network's ''Yes Weekend!'' block. It also airs worldwide via [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]].\n\n==History==\n'''''Banana Split''''' is a spiritual successor to the comedy program ''[[Goin' Bananas (TV series)|Goin' Bananas]]'' that featured [[Edgar Mortiz]], [[Christopher de Leon]], [[Jay Ilagan]], and [[Johnny Delgado]].\n\n''Banana Split'' debuted on October 11, 2008 with an all-girl cast led by [[Angelica Panganiban]] and [[Cristine Reyes]], with different male celebrity guests each week. The second season premiered on February 28, 2009, and the third season on April 18, 2009 with a new cast, including [[John Prats]], [[Zanjoe Marudo]], [[Jayson Gainza]], [[Pooh (comedian)|Pooh]], and [[Pokwang]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/3058/Pokwang-on-joining-Banana-Split-Hindi-ko-naman-po-sinulot-ibinigay-sa-akin-ng-kusa-.aspx | title = Pokwang on joining Banana Split: \u2018Hindi ko naman po sinulot, ibinigay sa akin ng kusa\u2019 | publisher = ABS-CBN | date = 2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Banana Split includes new stars for third season | url = https://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/3701/banana-split-includes-new-stars-for-third-season | publisher = PEP | date = 2009-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/3068/Are-John-Prats-Jayson-Gainza-and-Zanjoe-Marudo-the-new-Bad-Bananas-.aspx | title=Are John Prats, Jayson Gainza, and Zanjoe Marudo the new \u2018Bad Bananas?\u2019 | publisher = ABS-CBN | date = 2009-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/3066/Has-Pooh-changed-for-the-worse-because-of-his-success-in-showbiz-.aspx | title = Has Pooh changed for the worse because of his success in showbiz? | publisher = ABS-CBN | date=2009-04-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pep.ph/guide/3732/Banana-Split-will-introduce-new-segments-starting-April-18 Banana Split will introduce new segments starting April 18] retrieved via http://www.pep.ph 04-18-2009</ref> The fourth season premiered on July 18, 2009.<ref>[http://www.pep.ph/guide/4322/Banana-Split-marks-its-fourth-season-on-ABS-CBN Banana Split marks its fourth season on ABS-CBN] http://www.pep.ph July 22, 2009</ref> On September 30, 2009, a 30-minute weekday afternoon edition called '''''Banana Split: Daily Servings''''' originally aired every Mondays to Fridays on the network's ''Hapontastic'' afternoon block.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbn.com/TV/Article/5012/Default.aspx Jaysona Boto SAlSAL gears up for the new season of Banana Split] retrieved via http://www.abs-cbn.com 09-24-2009</ref> The timeslot later moved to ''Umaganda'' weekday morning block from 10:00{{nbsp}}AM to 10:30{{nbsp}}AM starting August 2010, but was moved again twice as early from 9:00{{nbsp}}AM to 9:30{{nbsp}}AM on June 27, 2011. On July 9, 2011, the original Saturday edition was reformatted as '''''Banana Split: Extra Scoop''''', featuring live comedy performances and also includes the second season of ''Clown in a Million'' segment, a reality comedy search. On September 12, 2011, ''Banana Split: Daily Servings'' was renamed to '''''Banana Split: Lafternoon Delight''''' as the timeslot moved to 2:45{{nbsp}}PM as part of ''Kapamilya Gold'' afternoon block. However, it was later cancelled on October 7, 2011.\n\n''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' garnered high ratings on its Saturday late-night timeslot compare to the counterpart programs. Due to the success, ABS-CBN launched a late-weeknight edition called '''''Banana Nite''''' which premiered on February 25, 2013 every Mondays to Fridays right after ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]''. ''Banana Nite'' extended its airtime to 45 minutes on August 5, 2013, but was later reverted to 30 minutes on February 10, 2014 onwards. ''Banana Nite'' ended on October 30, 2015 after a two-year run. Meanwhile, ''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' ended on November 7, 2015 after its four-year run. The show reformatted on November 15, 2015 as '''''Banana Sundae''''' which now airs every Sunday afternoons at 2:30{{nbsp}}PM right after ''[[ASAP (TV program)|ASAP Natin 'To]]''.\n[[File:bsplit-logo.png|250px|thumb|right|''Banana Split'' original logo <small>(2008\u20132015)</small>]]\n\nOn April 2020, Banana Sundae was temporarily put off the air, in response to rival network GMA extending ''Kapuso Movie Festival'' to a two-movie block, which made the network extend the Sunday edition of ''KB Family Weekend'' to two movies, causing [[ASAP (TV program)|ASAP Natin 'To]] shorten to a 1-hour airtime in Banana Sundae's timeslot, as part of ABS-CBN's temporary programming changes due to the [[2020 Luzon enhanced community quarantine|2020 Luzon lockdown]], which is part of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines|COVID-19 pandemic in the country]].

The skit drew mixed reactions with viewers calling it \"racist and insensitive\" as well as referencing the history of [[blackface]], while others noted that the show never mocked skin color, but instead, the argument itself and the political history of the Binay family.\n\n==SPG rating==\n''Banana Sundae'' is given an SPG rating by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board|Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)]] due to themes and strong languages not suitable for very young audiences.\n\n==Accolades==\n* 24th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split'' (Won)\n* 24th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Comedy Actress\" \u2013 Angelica Panganiban (Won)\n* 23rd PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split'' (Won \u2013 tied with GMA-7's ''[[Bubble Gang]]'') \n* 27th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' (Won \u2013 tied with GMA-7's ''Bubble Gang'')\n* 23rd PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Comedy Actor\" \u2013 Pooh (Won)\n* 8th Gawad Tanglaw Best Comedy/Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split'' (Won \u2013 tied with ''[[Goin' Bulilit]]'')<ref>[https://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/5427/winners-of-8th-gawad-tanglaw-revealed Winners of 8th Gawad Tanglaw revealed] retrieved via http://www.pep.ph 01-23-2010</ref>\n* 29th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' (Won)\n* 29rd PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Comedy Actor\" \u2013 Jayson Gainza (Won)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://bananasundae.abs-cbn.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|6895170}}\n\n{{ABS-CBN Shows (current and upcoming)}}\n{{ABS-CBN comedy shows}}\n\n[[Category:ABS-CBN shows]]\n[[Category:Philippine comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Philippine television sketch shows]]\n[[Category:2008 Philippine television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Star Creatives]]\n[[Category:Television productions suspended due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|The Banana Splits}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Banana Sundae\n| show_name_2              = Banana Split <small>(2008\u20132011)</small> <br> Banana Split: Daily Servings <small>(2009\u20132011)</small> <br> Banana Split: Lafternoon Delight <small>(2011)</small> <br> Banana Nite <small>(2013\u20132015)</small> <br> Banana Split Extra Scoop <small>(2011\u20132015)</small> <br> Banana Sundae <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n| image                    = Bananasundaetitlecard.jpg\n| genre                    = [[Sketch comedy|Gag show]] <br> [[Stand-up comedy]]\n| creator                  = [[Edgar Mortiz]]\n| developer                = [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Corporation]]\n| director                 = Edgar Mortiz <br> Jose Mari Reyes\n| executive_producer       = Rocky Ubana\n| location                 = Studio 2, [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]], [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]\n| presenter                = [[#Cast|See cast]]\n| country                  = [[Philippines]]\n| language                 = [[Filipino language|Filipino]]\n| runtime                  = 60 minutes\n| company                  = [[Star Cinema|Star Creatives TV]]\n| network                  = [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]\n| picture_format           = [[480i]] ([[standard-definition television|SDTV]]) <br> [[1080i]] ([[high-definition television|HDTV]])\n| first_aired              = {{start date|2008|10|11}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| preceded_by              = ''[[That's My Doc]]''\n| website                  = http://bananasundae.abs-cbn.com/\n}}\n\n'''''Banana Sundae''''' (formerly '''''Banana Split''''') is a [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[comedy]] [[Sketch comedy|gag show]] broadcast by [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]].

On July 9, 2011, the original Saturday edition was reformatted as '''''Banana Split: Extra Scoop''''', featuring live comedy performances and also includes the second season of ''Clown in a Million'' segment, a reality comedy search. On September 12, 2011, ''Banana Split: Daily Servings'' was renamed to '''''Banana Split: Lafternoon Delight''''' as the timeslot moved to 2:45{{nbsp}}PM as part of ''Kapamilya Gold'' afternoon block. However, it was later cancelled on October 7, 2011.\n\n''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' garnered high ratings on its Saturday late-night timeslot compare to the counterpart programs. Due to the success, ABS-CBN launched a late-weeknight edition called '''''Banana Nite''''' which premiered on February 25, 2013 every Mondays to Fridays right after ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]''. ''Banana Nite'' extended its airtime to 45 minutes on August 5, 2013, but was later reverted to 30 minutes on February 10, 2014 onwards. ''Banana Nite'' ended on October 30, 2015 after a two-year run. Meanwhile, ''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' ended on November 7, 2015 after its four-year run.

A public apology was also delivered after the end of the show.<ref>{{cite web| title= \"Banana Split\" EP surprised by Rafael Rosell's interview about attempted gay-kissing \"playtime\" | url= http://www.pep.ph/news/19984/Banana-Split-EP-surprised-by-Rafael-Rosells-interview-about-attempted-gay-kissing-playtime/2 | author = Roldan Castro | publisher= PEP | date = 2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Rafael Rosell upset by bad joke in 'Banana Split' | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/19979/Rafael-Rosell-upset-by-attempted-kiss-on-the-lips-by-gays-in-Banana-Split | author = Archie de Calma | publisher = PEP | date = 2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/1822/Why-Rafael-Rosell-did-not-find-The-Banana-Split-practical-joke-funny-.aspx Why Rafael Rosell did not find The Banana Split practical joke funny] Retrieved via http://www.abs-cbn.com 11-29-2008</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/19984/Banana-Split-EP-surprised-by-Rafael-Rosell | title = \"Banana Split\" EP surprised by Rafael Rosell's interview about attempted gay-kissing \"playtime\" | publisher = PEP | date=2008-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Casting cut-out===\n{{Confusing|section|date=June 2011}}\nValerie Concepcion, Roxanne Guinoo and Dianne Medina left ''Banana Split'' to focus on ''Precious Hearts Romances'' series where they will act in different episodes.

Pooh and former SexBomb Girls member Sunshine Garcia played as the Binay siblings, putting black makeup on themselves. The skit drew mixed reactions with viewers calling it \"racist and insensitive\" as well as referencing the history of [[blackface]], while others noted that the show never mocked skin color, but instead, the argument itself and the political history of the Binay family.\n\n==SPG rating==\n''Banana Sundae'' is given an SPG rating by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board|Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)]] due to themes and strong languages not suitable for very young audiences.\n\n==Accolades==\n* 24th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split'' (Won)\n* 24th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Comedy Actress\" \u2013 Angelica Panganiban (Won)\n* 23rd PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split'' (Won \u2013 tied with GMA-7's ''[[Bubble Gang]]'') \n* 27th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' (Won \u2013 tied with GMA-7's ''Bubble Gang'')\n* 23rd PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Comedy Actor\" \u2013 Pooh (Won)\n* 8th Gawad Tanglaw Best Comedy/Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split'' (Won \u2013 tied with ''[[Goin' Bulilit]]'')<ref>[https://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/5427/winners-of-8th-gawad-tanglaw-revealed Winners of 8th Gawad Tanglaw revealed] retrieved via http://www.pep.ph 01-23-2010</ref>\n* 29th PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Gag Show\" \u2013 ''Banana Split: Extra Scoop'' (Won)\n* 29rd PMPC Star Awards for Television's \"Best Comedy Actor\" \u2013 Jayson Gainza (Won)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://bananasundae.abs-cbn.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|6895170}}\n\n{{ABS-CBN Shows (current and upcoming)}}\n{{ABS-CBN comedy shows}}\n\n[[Category:ABS-CBN shows]]\n[[Category:Philippine comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Philippine television sketch shows]]\n[[Category:2008 Philippine television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Star Creatives]]\n[[Category:Television productions suspended due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n", "name_user": "RobertskySemi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:bypass redirect, replaced:ASAP Natin 'Toshorten to a 1-hour airtime in Banana Sundae's timeslot, as part of ABS-CBN's temporary programming changes due to the [[2020 Luzon enhanced community quarantine|2020 Luzon", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Sundae"}
