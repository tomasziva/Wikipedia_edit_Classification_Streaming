The patient showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home; he was subsequently confirmed to have completely recovered. Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease, while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness. The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020 in Kathmandu. {{as of|2020|05|03}}, 73 additional cases have been confirmed; affecting 14 Districts in six Provinces.<!--GETS OUTDATED--> The first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in Kailali.

Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds.

India, the United States and Germany have increased their support to Nepali health sector.\n\nNepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to Visit Nepal Year 2020.
