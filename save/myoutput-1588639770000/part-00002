It is a process that deforms the [[Metric tensor|metric]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] in a way formally analogous to the [[diffusion]] of heat. Heuristically speaking, at every point of the manifold the Ricci flow shrinks directions of positive curvature and expands directions of negative curvature, while simultaneously smoothing out irregularities in the metric. The latter is analogous to the smoothing behavior of the [[heat equation]].\n\nThe Ricci flow, named after [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]], was first introduced by [[Richard S. Hamilton]] in 1981 and is also referred to as the '''Ricci\u2013Hamilton flow'''. It is the primary tool used in [[Grigori Perelman]]'s [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture#Solution|solution of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]],<ref>{{Cite arxiv<!-- Deny Citation bot-->  |arxiv=math/0211159 |title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications |last1=Perelman |first1=Grisha |year=2002}}</ref> as well as in the proof of the [[differentiable sphere theorem]] by [[Simon Brendle]] and [[Richard Schoen]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1090/s0273-0979-2010-01312-4| title = Curvature, Sphere Theorems, and the Ricci flow| journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society| volume = 48| pages = 1| year = 2011| last1 = Brendle | first1 = S. | last2 = Schoen | first2 = R. | arxiv = 1001.2278| bibcode = 1994BAMaS..30..205W}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\n\nGiven a Riemannian manifold with [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{ij}</math>, we can compute the [[Ricci tensor]] <math>R_{ij}</math>, which collects averages of sectional curvatures into a kind of \"[[trace (linear algebra)|trace]]\" of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].  If we consider the metric tensor (and the associated Ricci tensor) to be functions of a variable which is usually called \"time\" (but which may have nothing to do with any physical time), then the Ricci flow may be defined by the '''geometric evolution equation'''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Friedan|first=D.|authorlink=Daniel Friedan|title=Nonlinear models in 2+\u03b5 dimensions | journal = PRL | volume = 45 | issue = 13| pages = 1057\u20131060 | year = 1980 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.1057 | bibcode=1980PhRvL..45.1057F|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc841801/|type=Submitted manuscript}}</ref>\n:<math>\\partial_t g_{ij}=-2 R_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe normalized Ricci flow makes sense for [[Compact space|compact]] manifolds and is given by the equation\n:<math>\\partial_t g_{ij}=-2 R_{ij} +\\frac{2}{n} R_\\mathrm{avg} g_{ij}</math>\nwhere <math>R_\\mathrm{avg}</math> is the average (mean) of the scalar curvature (which is obtained from the Ricci tensor by taking the trace) and <math>n</math> is the dimension of the manifold. This normalized equation preserves the volume of the metric.\n\nThe factor of \u22122 is of little significance, since it can be changed to any nonzero real number by rescaling ''t''. However, the minus sign ensures that the Ricci flow is well defined for sufficiently small positive times; if the sign is changed, then the Ricci flow would usually only be defined for small negative times. (This is similar to the way in which the [[heat equation]] can be run forwards in time, but not usually backwards in time.)\n\nInformally, the Ricci flow tends to expand negatively curved regions of the manifold, and contract positively curved regions.\n\n==Existence and uniqueness==\nLet <math>M</math> be a smooth closed manifold, and let <math>g_0</math> be any smooth Riemannian metric on <math>M</math>. Making use of the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem, Hamilton showed the following existence theorem:\n* There exists a positive number <math>T</math> and, for each <math>t\\in(0,T),</math> a smooth Riemannian metric <math>g(t)</math> on <math>M</math> such that <math>\\partial_t g(t)_{ij}=-2R^{g(t)}_{ij}</math> everywhere on <math>M</math> for all <math>t\\in(0,T)</math>, and such that <math>g(t)\\to g_0</math> in the <math>C^\\infty</math> topology as <math>t\\searrow 0</math>.\nHe showed the following uniqueness theorem:\n* If <math>\\{g_t:t\\in(0,T)\\}</math> and <math>\\{\\widetilde{g}_t:t\\in(0,\\widetilde{T})\\}</math> are two one-parameter families of Riemannian metrics as in the above existence theorem, then <math>g_t=\\widetilde{g}_t</math> for all <math>t\\in(0,\\min\\{T,\\widetilde{T}\\}).</math>\nThe existence theorem provides a one-parameter family of smooth Riemannian metrics. In fact, any such one-parameter family also depends smoothly on the parameter. Precisely, this says that given any smooth coordinate chart <math>(U,\\varphi)</math> on <math>M</math>, the function <math>g_{ij}:U\\times(0,T)\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> is smooth for any <math>i,j=1,\\ldots,n.</math>\n\n[[Dennis DeTurck]] subsequently gave a proof of the above results which uses the Banach implicit function theorem instead.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DeTurck |first1=Dennis M. |title=Deforming metrics in the direction of their Ricci tensors |journal=J.

The principle behind virtually all major applications of Ricci flow, in particular in the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and geometrization conjecture, is that, as <math>t</math> approaches this maximal value, the behavior of the metrics <math>g_t</math> can reveal and reflect deep information about <math>M</math>.\n\nGiven a solution of the Ricci flow, as provided by the above existence and uniqueness theorem, select the function <math>c:(0,T)\\to(0,\\infty)</math> with <math>c(0)=1</math>, subject to the requirement that <math>(M,c_tg_t)</math> has volume independent of <math>t</math>.

The next major breakthrough came in 2008, when Christoph B\u00f6hm and Burkhard Wilking extended Hamilton's 1986 result to every dimension:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B\u00f6hm |first1=Christoph |last2=Wilking |first2=Burkhard |title=Manifolds with positive curvature operators are space forms |journal=Ann. of Math.

This is not the case in any higher dimension, and so in those cases it is impossible to hope to be able to simply drop the curvature conditions from the above theorems of Hamilton, B\u00f6hm-Wilking, Brendle-Schoen, and Brendle. It could be possible to identify curvature conditions other than those presented in these results, but the existence of compact manifolds such as [[complex projective space]], which has a metric of nonnegative curvature operator (the [[Fubini-Study metric]]) but no metric of constant curvature, makes it unclear how much further these conditions can be pushed.\n\n==Li-Yau inequalities==\nIn 1993, by making use of a technique pioneered by Peter Li and [[Shing-Tung Yau]] for parabolic differential equations on Riemannian manifolds, Hamilton proved the following \"Li-Yau inequality.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Peter |last2=Yau |first2=Shing-Tung |title=On the parabolic kernel of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator |journal=Acta Math. |date=1986 |volume=156 |issue=3-4 |pages=153-201}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Richard S. |title=The Harnack estimate for the Ricci flow |journal=J.

J. Math. |date=1995 |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=545-572}}</ref> to construct \"singularity models,\" which are Ricci flows on new three-dimensional manifolds. Owing to the Hamilton-Ivey estimate, these new Ricci flows have nonnegative curvature. Hamilton's Li-Yau inequality can then be applied to see that the scalar curvature is, at each point, a nondecreasing (nonnegative) function of time. This is a powerful result that allows many further arguments to go through. In the end, Perelman shows that any of his singularity models is asymptotically like a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton, which are completely classified; see the previous section.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Einstein metrics===\n*If the manifold is [[Euclidean space]], or more generally [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci-flat]], then Ricci flow leaves the metric unchanged.  Conversely, any metric unchanged by Ricci flow is [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci-flat]].\n*If the manifold is a [[sphere]] (with the usual metric), or more generally an [[Einstein metric]] (where Ricci tensor = constant \u00d7 metric tensor) with positive curvature, then Ricci flow collapses the manifold to a point in finite time. For example, the metric of the ''n''-dimensional sphere of radius 1, after time <math>t</math>,  will be multiplied by <math> (1-2t(n-1))</math>, so the manifold will collapse after time <math>1/2(n-1)</math>. This shows that the Ricci flow sometimes cannot be continued for all time, instead producing singularities.\n* If the manifold is an [[Einstein manifold]] with negative curvature, then Ricci flow will expand it.\n\n===Ricci solitons===\n\n{{anchor|cigar_soliton_solution}}\n[[Ricci soliton | Ricci solitons]] are Ricci flows that may change their size but not their shape up to diffeomorphisms.\n* Cylinders '''S'''<sup>k</sup> \u00d7 '''R'''<sup>l</sup> (for ''k \u2265 2'') shrink self similarly under the Ricci flow up to diffeomorphisms\n*A significant 2-dimensional example is the '''cigar soliton''', which is given by the metric (''dx''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''dy''<sup>2</sup>)/(''e''<sup>4''t''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>) on the Euclidean plane. Although this metric shrinks under the Ricci flow, its geometry remains the same. Such solutions are called steady Ricci solitons.\n* An example of a 3-dimensional steady Ricci soliton is the '''[[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Bryant]] soliton''', which is rotationally symmetric, has positive curvature, and is obtained by solving a system of ordinary differential equations.  A similar construction works in arbitrary dimension.\n* There exist numerous families of K\u00e4hler manifolds, invariant under a ''U(n)'' action and birational to ''C<sup>n</sup>'', which are Ricci solitons. These examples were constructed by Cao and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf.<ref>B. Chow and D. Knopf, ''The Ricci Flow: An Introduction'', ser. ''Mathematical Surveys and Monographs''. American Mathematical Society, 2004.[https://doi.org/10.1090/surv/110 doi:10.1090/surv/110]</ref>\n\nA \"gradient shrinking Ricci soliton\" consists of a smooth Riemannian manifold <math>(M,g)</math> and <math>f\\in C^\\infty(M)</math> such that <math>\\operatorname{Ric}^g+\\operatorname{Hess}^gf=\\frac{1}{2}g</math>. One of Perelman's major achievements, in his first paper on Ricci flow, was to show that finite-time singularities of the Ricci flow on three-dimensional closed manifolds are modeled on complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. In 2008, [[Huai-Dong Cao]], Bing-Long Chen, and [[Xi-Ping Zhu]] completed the classification of these solitons, showing:\n* if <math>(M,g,f)</math> is a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with <math>\\dim M=3</math>, then the universal cover of <math>M</math>, with Riemannian metric given by the pullback of <math>g</math>, is isometric to <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>, <math>S^3</math>, or <math>S^2\\times\\mathbb{R}</math>, each with their standard Riemannian structures.\nThis was originally shown by Perelman, in his second paper, with some extra conditional assumptions. There is not yet a good understanding of gradient shrinking Ricci solitons in any higher dimensions.\n\n== Relationship to uniformization and geometrization ==\n\nThe Ricci flow was utilized by [[Richard S. Hamilton]] (1981) to gain insight into the [[geometrization conjecture]] of [[William Thurston]], which concerns the [[homeomorphism|topological classification]] of three-dimensional smooth manifolds.<ref>{{cite book | author=Weeks, Jeffrey R. | title=The Shape of Space: how to visualize surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds| location=New York | publisher=Marcel Dekker | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-8247-7437-0| author-link=Jeffrey Weeks (mathematician)}}.  A popular book that explains the background for the Thurston classification program.</ref> Hamilton's idea was to define a kind of nonlinear [[heat equation|diffusion equation]] which would tend to smooth out irregularities in the metric.  Then, by placing an ''arbitrary'' metric ''g'' on a given smooth manifold ''M'' and evolving the metric by the Ricci flow, the metric should approach a particularly nice metric, which might constitute a [[canonical form]] for ''M''.  Suitable canonical forms had already been identified by Thurston; the possibilities, called '''Thurston model geometries''', include the three-sphere '''S'''<sup>3</sup>, three-dimensional Euclidean space '''E'''<sup>3</sup>, three-dimensional hyperbolic space '''H'''<sup>3</sup>, which are [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]], and five slightly more exotic Riemannian manifolds, which are homogeneous but not isotropic.  (This list is closely related to, but not identical with, the [[Bianchi classification]] of the three-dimensional real [[Lie algebra]]s into nine classes.) Hamilton's idea was that these special metrics should behave like [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the Ricci flow, and that if, for a given manifold, globally only one Thurston geometry was admissible, this might even act like an [[attractor]] under the flow.\n\nHamilton succeeded in proving that any smooth closed three-manifold which admits a metric of ''positive'' Ricci curvature also admits a unique Thurston geometry, namely a spherical metric, which does indeed act like an attracting fixed point under the Ricci flow, renormalized to preserve volume. (Under the unrenormalized Ricci flow, the manifold collapses to a point in finite time.)  This doesn't prove the full geometrization conjecture, because the most difficult case turns out to concern manifolds with ''negative'' Ricci curvature and more specifically those with negative sectional curvature.\n\nIndeed, a triumph of nineteenth-century geometry was the proof of the [[uniformization theorem]], the analogous topological classification of smooth two-manifolds, where Hamilton showed that the Ricci flow does indeed evolve a negatively curved two-manifold into a two-dimensional multi-holed torus which is locally isometric to the hyperbolic plane.  This topic is closely related to important topics in analysis, number theory, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, and even cosmology.\n\nNote that the term \"uniformization\" suggests a kind of smoothing away of irregularities in the geometry, while the term \"geometrization\" suggests placing a geometry on a smooth manifold.  ''Geometry'' is being used here in a precise manner akin to [[Felix Klein|Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program|notion of geometry]] (see [[Geometrization conjecture]] for further details).  In particular, the result of geometrization may be a geometry that is not [[isotropic]].  In most cases including the cases of constant curvature, the geometry is unique.  An important theme in this area is the interplay between real and complex formulations.  In particular, many discussions of uniformization speak of complex curves rather than real two-manifolds.\n\nThe Ricci flow does not preserve volume, so to be more careful, in applying the Ricci flow to uniformization and geometrization one needs to ''normalize'' the Ricci flow to obtain a flow which preserves volume.  If one fails to do this, the problem is that (for example) instead of evolving a given three-dimensional manifold into one of Thurston's canonical forms, we might just shrink its size.\n\nIt is possible to construct a kind of [[moduli space]] of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and then the Ricci flow really does give a ''[[geometric flow]]'' (in the intuitive sense of particles flowing along flowlines) in this moduli space.\n\n==Singularities==\n[[Richard_S._Hamilton | Hamilton]] showed that a compact Riemannian manifold always admits a short-time Ricci flow solution. Later Shi generalized the short-time existence result to complete manifolds of bounded curvature.<ref>{{cite journal |first=W.-X. |last=Shi |title=Deforming the metric on complete Riemannian manifolds |journal=Journal of Differential Geometry |volume=30 |year=1989 |pages=223\u2013301 |doi=10.4310/jdg/1214443292 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In general, however, due to the highly non-linear nature of the Ricci flow equation, singularities form in finite time. These singularities are curvature singularities, which means that as one approaches the singular time the norm of the [[Riemann curvature tensor | curvature tensor]] <math>|\\operatorname{Rm}|</math> blows up to infinity in the region of the singularity. A fundamental problem in Ricci flow is to understand all the possible geometries of singularities. When successful, this can lead to insights into the topology of manifolds. For instance, analyzing the geometry of singular regions that may develop in 3d Ricci flow, is the crucial ingredient in Perelman's proof the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures. \n\n===Blow-up limits of singularities===\n\nTo study the formation of singularities it is useful, as in the study of other non-linear differential equations, to consider blow-ups limits. Intuitively speaking, one zooms into the singular region of the Ricci flow by rescaling time and space. Under certain assumptions, the zoomed in flow tends to a limiting Ricci flow <math> (M_\\infty, g_\\infty(t)), t \\in (-\\infty, 0] </math>, called a '''singularity model'''. Singularity models are ancient Ricci flows, i.e. they can be extended infinitely into the past. Understanding the possible singularity models in Ricci flow is an active research endeavor.\n\nBelow, we sketch the blow-up procedure in more detail: Let <math> (M, g_t), \\, t \\in [0,T), </math> be a Ricci flow that develops a singularity as <math>t \\rightarrow T</math>. Let <math>(p_i, t_i) \\in M \\times [0,T) </math> be a sequence of points in spacetime such that \n:<math>K_i := |\\operatorname{Rm}(g_{t_i})|(p_i) \\rightarrow \\infty  </math>\nas <math>i \\rightarrow \\infty</math>. Then one considers the parabolically rescaled metrics\n:<math>g_i(t) = K_i g\\left(t_i + \\frac{t}{K_i}\\right), \\quad t\\in[-K_i t_i, 0]</math>\nDue to the symmetry of the Ricci flow equation under parabolic dilations, the metrics <math>g_i(t)</math> are also solutions to the Ricci flow equation. In the case that \n:<math> |Rm| \\leq K_i  \\text{ on } M \\times [0,t_i]</math>,\ni.e. up to time <math>t_i</math> the maximum of the curvature is attained at <math>p_i</math>, then the pointed sequence of Ricci flows <math>(M, g_i(t), p_i)</math> subsequentially converges smoothly to a limiting ancient Ricci flow <math> (M_{\\infty}, g_{\\infty}(t), p_{\\infty})</math>.

Any metric tensor on a two-manifold can be written with respect to an '''exponential isothermal coordinate chart''' in the form\n:<math> ds^2 = \\exp(2 \\, p(x,y)) \\, \\left( dx^2 + dy^2 \\right). </math>\n(These coordinates provide an example of a [[conformal map|conformal]] coordinate chart, because angles, but not distances, are correctly represented.)\n\nThe easiest way to compute the [[Ricci tensor]] and [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]] for our Riemannian two-manifold is to use the differential forms method of [[\u00c9lie Cartan]].  Take the '''[[coframe field]]'''\n:<math> \\sigma^1 = \\exp (p) \\, dx, \\; \\; \\sigma^2 = \\exp (p) \\, dy</math>\nso that [[metric tensor]] becomes\n:<math> \\sigma^1 \\otimes \\sigma^1 + \\sigma^2 \\otimes \\sigma^2 = \\exp(2 p) \\, \\left( dx \\otimes dx + dy \\otimes dy \\right). </math>\n\nNext, given an arbitrary smooth function <math>h(x,y)</math>, compute the [[exterior derivative]]\n:<math> d h = h_x dx + h_y dy = \\exp(-p) h_x \\, \\sigma^1 + \\exp(-p) h_y \\, \\sigma^2.</math>\nTake the [[Hodge dual]]\n:<math> \\star d h = -\\exp(-p) h_y \\, \\sigma^1 + \\exp(-p) h_x \\, \\sigma^2 = -h_y \\, dx + h_x \\, dy.</math>\nTake another exterior derivative\n:<math> d \\star d h = -h_{yy} \\, dy \\wedge dx + h_{xx} \\, dx \\wedge dy = \\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\right) \\, dx \\wedge dy </math>\n(where we used the '''anti-commutative property''' of the [[exterior product]]).  That is,\n:<math> d \\star d h = \\exp(-2 p) \\, \\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\right) \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2. </math>\nTaking another Hodge dual gives\n:<math> \\Delta h = \\star d \\star d h = \\exp(-2 p) \\, \\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\right)</math>\nwhich gives the desired expression for the Laplace/Beltrami operator\n:<math> \\Delta = \\exp(-2 \\, p(x,y)) \\left( D_x^2 + D_y^2 \\right). </math>\n\nTo compute the curvature tensor, we take the exterior derivative of the covector fields making up our coframe:\n:<math> d \\sigma^1 = p_y \\exp(p) dy \\wedge dx = -\\left( p_y dx \\right) \\wedge \\sigma^2 = -{\\omega^1}_2 \\wedge \\sigma^2</math>\n:<math> d \\sigma^2 = p_x \\exp(p) dx \\wedge dy = -\\left( p_x dy \\right) \\wedge \\sigma^1 = -{\\omega^2}_1 \\wedge \\sigma^1.</math>\nFrom these expressions, we can read off the only independent '''[[Spin connection]] one-form'''\n:<math> {\\omega^1}_2 = p_y dx - p_x dy,</math>\nwhere we have taken advantage of the anti-symmetric property of the connection (<math>{\\omega^2}_1=-{\\omega^1}_2</math>). Take another exterior derivative\n:<math> d {\\omega^1}_2 = p_{yy} dy \\wedge dx - p_{xx} dx \\wedge dy = -\\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\right) \\, dx \\wedge dy.</math>\nThis gives the '''curvature two-form'''\n:<math> {\\Omega^1}_2 = -\\exp(-2p) \\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\right) \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2 = -\\Delta p \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2</math>\nfrom which we can read off the only linearly independent component of the [[Riemann tensor]] using\n:<math> {\\Omega^1}_2 = {R^1}_{212} \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2.</math>\nNamely\n:<math> {R^1}_{212} = -\\Delta p</math>\nfrom which the only nonzero components of the [[Ricci tensor]] are\n:<math> R_{22} = R_{11} = -\\Delta p.</math>\nFrom this, we find components with respect to the '''coordinate cobasis''', namely\n:<math> R_{xx} = R_{yy} = -\\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\right). </math>\n\nBut the metric tensor is also diagonal, with\n:<math> g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\exp (2 p)</math>\nand after some elementary manipulation, we obtain an elegant expression for the Ricci flow:\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\Delta p. </math>\nThis is manifestly analogous to the best known of all diffusion equations, the [[heat equation]]\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\Delta u </math>\nwhere now <math>\\Delta = D_x^2 + D_y^2</math> is the usual [[Laplacian]] on the Euclidean plane.\nThe reader may object that the heat equation is of course a [[linear]] [[partial differential equation]]\u2014where is the promised ''nonlinearity'' in the p.d.e. defining the Ricci flow?\n\nThe answer is that nonlinearity enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric.  But notice that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking <math> p(x,y) = 0</math>.  So if <math>p</math> is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation.  This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out the same way that heat can be carried off \"to infinity\" in an infinite flat plate.  But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to ''homogenize'' the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero.  In the same way, we expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not to turn it into a flat Euclidean geometry.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\nThe Ricci flow has been intensively studied since 1981. Some recent work has focused on the question of precisely how higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds evolve under the Ricci flow, and in particular, what types of parametric [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] may form.  For instance, a certain class of solutions to the Ricci flow demonstrates that '''neckpinch singularities''' will form on an evolving ''n''-dimensional metric Riemannian manifold having a certain topological property (positive [[Euler characteristic]]), as the flow approaches some characteristic time <math>t_{0}</math>.  In certain cases, such neckpinches will produce manifolds called [[Ricci soliton]]s.\n\nFor a 3-dimensional manifold, Perelman showed how to continue past the singularities using [[Poincare conjecture#Ricci flow with surgery|surgery on the manifold]].\n\nK\u00e4hler metrics remain K\u00e4hler under Ricci flow, and so Ricci flow has applications  to the construction of [[K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric]]s.<ref>https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+flow+AND+ricci+AND+Einstein+metric/0/1/0/all/0/1</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n===Applications===\n* [[Uniformization theorem]]\n* [[Geometrization conjecture]]\n* [[Solution of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]\n* [[Differentiable sphere theorem]]\n\n===General context===\n* [[Ricci curvature]]\n* [[Calculus of variations]]\n* [[Geometric flow]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | author=Brendle, Simon | title =Ricci Flow and the Sphere Theorem| publisher=American Mathematical Society | year=2010| isbn=978-0-8218-4938-5 | url=http://www.ams.org/bookstore-getitem/item=GSM-111| author-link =Simon Brendle}}.\n*{{cite journal |arxiv=math.DG/0605667 |author1=Bruce Kleiner |author2-link=John Lott (mathematician) |author2=John Lott |title=Notes on Perelman's papers |year=2008 |doi=10.2140/gt.2008.12.2587 |volume=12 |issue=5 |journal= Geometry & Topology|pages=2587\u20132855|author1-link=Bruce Kleiner }}\n*{{cite journal | first = Huai-Dong | last = Cao | authorlink = Huai-Dong Cao |author2=Xi-Ping Zhu  | title = A Complete Proof of the Poincar\u00e9 and Geometrization Conjectures&nbsp;\u2014 application of the Hamilton-Perelman theory of the Ricci flow | url = http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk/~ajm/vol10/10_2.pdf | journal = Asian Journal of Mathematics | volume = 10 |date=June 2006 | issue =2| author2-link = Xi-Ping Zhu }}    [https://web.archive.org/web/20120514194801/http://www.intlpress.com/AJM/p/2006/10_2/AJM-10-2-Erratum.pdf Erratum].\n** Revised version: {{cite arXiv | eprint=math.DG/0612069 |title=Hamilton-Perelman's Proof of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture and the Geometrization Conjecture | author1=Huai-Dong Cao | author2=Xi-Ping Zhu | year=2006}}\n*{{Citation | editor-last1 = Cao | editor-first1 = H.

It is a process that deforms the [[Metric tensor|metric]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] in a way formally analogous to the [[diffusion]] of heat.

If we consider the metric tensor (and the associated Ricci tensor) to be functions of a variable which is usually called \"time\" (but which may have nothing to do with any physical time), then the Ricci flow may be defined by the '''geometric evolution equation'''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Friedan|first=D.|authorlink=Daniel Friedan|title=Nonlinear models in 2+\u03b5 dimensions | journal = PRL | volume = 45 | issue = 13| pages = 1057\u20131060 | year = 1980 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.1057 | bibcode=1980PhRvL..45.1057F|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc841801/|type=Submitted manuscript}}</ref>\n:<math>\\partial_t g_{ij}=-2 R_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe normalized Ricci flow makes sense for [[Compact space|compact]] manifolds and is given by the equation\n:<math>\\partial_t g_{ij}=-2 R_{ij} +\\frac{2}{n} R_\\mathrm{avg} g_{ij}</math>\nwhere <math>R_\\mathrm{avg}</math> is the average (mean) of the scalar curvature (which is obtained from the Ricci tensor by taking the trace) and <math>n</math> is the dimension of the manifold. This normalized equation preserves the volume of the metric.\n\nThe factor of \u22122 is of little significance, since it can be changed to any nonzero real number by rescaling ''t''. However, the minus sign ensures that the Ricci flow is well defined for sufficiently small positive times; if the sign is changed, then the Ricci flow would usually only be defined for small negative times. (This is similar to the way in which the [[heat equation]] can be run forwards in time, but not usually backwards in time.)\n\nInformally, the Ricci flow tends to expand negatively curved regions of the manifold, and contract positively curved regions.\n\n==Existence and uniqueness==\nLet <math>M</math> be a smooth closed manifold, and let <math>g_0</math> be any smooth Riemannian metric on <math>M</math>. Making use of the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem, Hamilton showed the following existence theorem:\n* There exists a positive number <math>T</math> and, for each <math>t\\in(0,T),</math> a smooth Riemannian metric <math>g(t)</math> on <math>M</math> such that <math>\\partial_t g(t)_{ij}=-2R^{g(t)}_{ij}</math> everywhere on <math>M</math> for all <math>t\\in(0,T)</math>, and such that <math>g(t)\\to g_0</math> in the <math>C^\\infty</math> topology as <math>t\\searrow 0</math>.\nHe showed the following uniqueness theorem:\n* If <math>\\{g_t:t\\in(0,T)\\}</math> and <math>\\{\\widetilde{g}_t:t\\in(0,\\widetilde{T})\\}</math> are two one-parameter families of Riemannian metrics as in the above existence theorem, then <math>g_t=\\widetilde{g}_t</math> for all <math>t\\in(0,\\min\\{T,\\widetilde{T}\\}).</math>\nThe existence theorem provides a one-parameter family of smooth Riemannian metrics. In fact, any such one-parameter family also depends smoothly on the parameter. Precisely, this says that given any smooth coordinate chart <math>(U,\\varphi)</math> on <math>M</math>, the function <math>g_{ij}:U\\times(0,T)\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> is smooth for any <math>i,j=1,\\ldots,n.</math>\n\n[[Dennis DeTurck]] subsequently gave a proof of the above results which uses the Banach implicit function theorem instead.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DeTurck |first1=Dennis M. |title=Deforming metrics in the direction of their Ricci tensors |journal=J.

The principle behind virtually all major applications of Ricci flow, in particular in the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and geometrization conjecture, is that, as <math>t</math> approaches this maximal value, the behavior of the metrics <math>g_t</math> can reveal and reflect deep information about <math>M</math>.\n\nGiven a solution of the Ricci flow, as provided by the above existence and uniqueness theorem, select the function <math>c:(0,T)\\to(0,\\infty)</math> with <math>c(0)=1</math>, subject to the requirement that <math>(M,c_tg_t)</math> has volume independent of <math>t</math>.

This is not the case in any higher dimension, and so in those cases it is impossible to hope to be able to simply drop the curvature conditions from the above theorems of Hamilton, B\u00f6hm-Wilking, Brendle-Schoen, and Brendle. It could be possible to identify curvature conditions other than those presented in these results, but the existence of compact manifolds such as [[complex projective space]], which has a metric of nonnegative curvature operator (the [[Fubini-Study metric]]) but no metric of constant curvature, makes it unclear how much further these conditions can be pushed.\n\n==Li-Yau inequalities==\nIn 1993, by making use of a technique pioneered by Peter Li and [[Shing-Tung Yau]] for parabolic differential equations on Riemannian manifolds, Hamilton proved the following \"Li-Yau inequality.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Peter |last2=Yau |first2=Shing-Tung |title=On the parabolic kernel of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator |journal=Acta Math. |date=1986 |volume=156 |issue=3-4 |pages=153-201}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Richard S. |title=The Harnack estimate for the Ricci flow |journal=J.

Owing to the Hamilton-Ivey estimate, these new Ricci flows have nonnegative curvature. Hamilton's Li-Yau inequality can then be applied to see that the scalar curvature is, at each point, a nondecreasing (nonnegative) function of time. This is a powerful result that allows many further arguments to go through. In the end, Perelman shows that any of his singularity models is asymptotically like a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton, which are completely classified; see the previous section.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Einstein metrics===\n*If the manifold is [[Euclidean space]], or more generally [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci-flat]], then Ricci flow leaves the metric unchanged.  Conversely, any metric unchanged by Ricci flow is [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci-flat]].\n*If the manifold is a [[sphere]] (with the usual metric), or more generally an [[Einstein metric]] (where Ricci tensor = constant \u00d7 metric tensor) with positive curvature, then Ricci flow collapses the manifold to a point in finite time. For example, the metric of the ''n''-dimensional sphere of radius 1, after time <math>t</math>,  will be multiplied by <math> (1-2t(n-1))</math>, so the manifold will collapse after time <math>1/2(n-1)</math>. This shows that the Ricci flow sometimes cannot be continued for all time, instead producing singularities.\n* If the manifold is an [[Einstein manifold]] with negative curvature, then Ricci flow will expand it.\n\n===Ricci solitons===\n\n{{anchor|cigar_soliton_solution}}\n[[Ricci soliton | Ricci solitons]] are Ricci flows that may change their size but not their shape up to diffeomorphisms.\n* Cylinders '''S'''<sup>k</sup> \u00d7 '''R'''<sup>l</sup> (for ''k \u2265 2'') shrink self similarly under the Ricci flow up to diffeomorphisms\n*A significant 2-dimensional example is the '''cigar soliton''', which is given by the metric (''dx''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''dy''<sup>2</sup>)/(''e''<sup>4''t''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>) on the Euclidean plane. Although this metric shrinks under the Ricci flow, its geometry remains the same. Such solutions are called steady Ricci solitons.\n* An example of a 3-dimensional steady Ricci soliton is the '''[[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Bryant]] soliton''', which is rotationally symmetric, has positive curvature, and is obtained by solving a system of ordinary differential equations.  A similar construction works in arbitrary dimension.\n* There exist numerous families of K\u00e4hler manifolds, invariant under a ''U(n)'' action and birational to ''C<sup>n</sup>'', which are Ricci solitons. These examples were constructed by Cao and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf.<ref>B. Chow and D. Knopf, ''The Ricci Flow: An Introduction'', ser. ''Mathematical Surveys and Monographs''. American Mathematical Society, 2004.[https://doi.org/10.1090/surv/110 doi:10.1090/surv/110]</ref>\n\nA \"gradient shrinking Ricci soliton\" consists of a smooth Riemannian manifold <math>(M,g)</math> and <math>f\\in C^\\infty(M)</math> such that <math>\\operatorname{Ric}^g+\\operatorname{Hess}^gf=\\frac{1}{2}g</math>. One of Perelman's major achievements, in his first paper on Ricci flow, was to show that finite-time singularities of the Ricci flow on three-dimensional closed manifolds are modeled on complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. In 2008, [[Huai-Dong Cao]], Bing-Long Chen, and [[Xi-Ping Zhu]] completed the classification of these solitons, showing:\n* if <math>(M,g,f)</math> is a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with <math>\\dim M=3</math>, then the universal cover of <math>M</math>, with Riemannian metric given by the pullback of <math>g</math>, is isometric to <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>, <math>S^3</math>, or <math>S^2\\times\\mathbb{R}</math>, each with their standard Riemannian structures.\nThis was originally shown by Perelman, in his second paper, with some extra conditional assumptions. There is not yet a good understanding of gradient shrinking Ricci solitons in any higher dimensions.\n\n== Relationship to uniformization and geometrization ==\n\nThe Ricci flow was utilized by [[Richard S. Hamilton]] (1981) to gain insight into the [[geometrization conjecture]] of [[William Thurston]], which concerns the [[homeomorphism|topological classification]] of three-dimensional smooth manifolds.<ref>{{cite book | author=Weeks, Jeffrey R. | title=The Shape of Space: how to visualize surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds| location=New York | publisher=Marcel Dekker | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-8247-7437-0| author-link=Jeffrey Weeks (mathematician)}}.  A popular book that explains the background for the Thurston classification program.</ref> Hamilton's idea was to define a kind of nonlinear [[heat equation|diffusion equation]] which would tend to smooth out irregularities in the metric.  Then, by placing an ''arbitrary'' metric ''g'' on a given smooth manifold ''M'' and evolving the metric by the Ricci flow, the metric should approach a particularly nice metric, which might constitute a [[canonical form]] for ''M''.  Suitable canonical forms had already been identified by Thurston; the possibilities, called '''Thurston model geometries''', include the three-sphere '''S'''<sup>3</sup>, three-dimensional Euclidean space '''E'''<sup>3</sup>, three-dimensional hyperbolic space '''H'''<sup>3</sup>, which are [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]], and five slightly more exotic Riemannian manifolds, which are homogeneous but not isotropic.  (This list is closely related to, but not identical with, the [[Bianchi classification]] of the three-dimensional real [[Lie algebra]]s into nine classes.) Hamilton's idea was that these special metrics should behave like [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the Ricci flow, and that if, for a given manifold, globally only one Thurston geometry was admissible, this might even act like an [[attractor]] under the flow.\n\nHamilton succeeded in proving that any smooth closed three-manifold which admits a metric of ''positive'' Ricci curvature also admits a unique Thurston geometry, namely a spherical metric, which does indeed act like an attracting fixed point under the Ricci flow, renormalized to preserve volume. (Under the unrenormalized Ricci flow, the manifold collapses to a point in finite time.)  This doesn't prove the full geometrization conjecture, because the most difficult case turns out to concern manifolds with ''negative'' Ricci curvature and more specifically those with negative sectional curvature.\n\nIndeed, a triumph of nineteenth-century geometry was the proof of the [[uniformization theorem]], the analogous topological classification of smooth two-manifolds, where Hamilton showed that the Ricci flow does indeed evolve a negatively curved two-manifold into a two-dimensional multi-holed torus which is locally isometric to the hyperbolic plane.  This topic is closely related to important topics in analysis, number theory, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, and even cosmology.\n\nNote that the term \"uniformization\" suggests a kind of smoothing away of irregularities in the geometry, while the term \"geometrization\" suggests placing a geometry on a smooth manifold.  ''Geometry'' is being used here in a precise manner akin to [[Felix Klein|Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program|notion of geometry]] (see [[Geometrization conjecture]] for further details).  In particular, the result of geometrization may be a geometry that is not [[isotropic]].  In most cases including the cases of constant curvature, the geometry is unique.  An important theme in this area is the interplay between real and complex formulations.  In particular, many discussions of uniformization speak of complex curves rather than real two-manifolds.\n\nThe Ricci flow does not preserve volume, so to be more careful, in applying the Ricci flow to uniformization and geometrization one needs to ''normalize'' the Ricci flow to obtain a flow which preserves volume.  If one fails to do this, the problem is that (for example) instead of evolving a given three-dimensional manifold into one of Thurston's canonical forms, we might just shrink its size.\n\nIt is possible to construct a kind of [[moduli space]] of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and then the Ricci flow really does give a ''[[geometric flow]]'' (in the intuitive sense of particles flowing along flowlines) in this moduli space.\n\n==Singularities==\n[[Richard_S._Hamilton | Hamilton]] showed that a compact Riemannian manifold always admits a short-time Ricci flow solution. Later Shi generalized the short-time existence result to complete manifolds of bounded curvature.<ref>{{cite journal |first=W.-X. |last=Shi |title=Deforming the metric on complete Riemannian manifolds |journal=Journal of Differential Geometry |volume=30 |year=1989 |pages=223\u2013301 |doi=10.4310/jdg/1214443292 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In general, however, due to the highly non-linear nature of the Ricci flow equation, singularities form in finite time. These singularities are curvature singularities, which means that as one approaches the singular time the norm of the [[Riemann curvature tensor | curvature tensor]] <math>|\\operatorname{Rm}|</math> blows up to infinity in the region of the singularity. A fundamental problem in Ricci flow is to understand all the possible geometries of singularities. When successful, this can lead to insights into the topology of manifolds. For instance, analyzing the geometry of singular regions that may develop in 3d Ricci flow, is the crucial ingredient in Perelman's proof the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures. \n\n===Blow-up limits of singularities===\n\nTo study the formation of singularities it is useful, as in the study of other non-linear differential equations, to consider blow-ups limits. Intuitively speaking, one zooms into the singular region of the Ricci flow by rescaling time and space. Under certain assumptions, the zoomed in flow tends to a limiting Ricci flow <math> (M_\\infty, g_\\infty(t)), t \\in (-\\infty, 0] </math>, called a '''singularity model'''. Singularity models are ancient Ricci flows, i.e. they can be extended infinitely into the past. Understanding the possible singularity models in Ricci flow is an active research endeavor.\n\nBelow, we sketch the blow-up procedure in more detail: Let <math> (M, g_t), \\, t \\in [0,T), </math> be a Ricci flow that develops a singularity as <math>t \\rightarrow T</math>. Let <math>(p_i, t_i) \\in M \\times [0,T) </math> be a sequence of points in spacetime such that \n:<math>K_i := |\\operatorname{Rm}(g_{t_i})|(p_i) \\rightarrow \\infty  </math>\nas <math>i \\rightarrow \\infty</math>. Then one considers the parabolically rescaled metrics\n:<math>g_i(t) = K_i g\\left(t_i + \\frac{t}{K_i}\\right), \\quad t\\in[-K_i t_i, 0]</math>\nDue to the symmetry of the Ricci flow equation under parabolic dilations, the metrics <math>g_i(t)</math> are also solutions to the Ricci flow equation. In the case that \n:<math> |Rm| \\leq K_i  \\text{ on } M \\times [0,t_i]</math>,\ni.e. up to time <math>t_i</math> the maximum of the curvature is attained at <math>p_i</math>, then the pointed sequence of Ricci flows <math>(M, g_i(t), p_i)</math> subsequentially converges smoothly to a limiting ancient Ricci flow <math> (M_{\\infty}, g_{\\infty}(t), p_{\\infty})</math>. Note that in general <math> M_\\infty </math> is not diffeomorphic to <math>M</math>.\n\n===Type I and Type II singularities===\nHamilton distinguishes between '''Type I and Type II singularities''' in Ricci flow.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R.

The FIK shrinker models the collapse of an embedded sphere with [[Intersection number|self-intersection number]] -1.\n\n== Relation to diffusion ==\nTo see why the evolution equation defining the Ricci flow is indeed a kind of nonlinear diffusion equation, we can consider the special case of (real) two-manifolds in more detail.  Any metric tensor on a two-manifold can be written with respect to an '''exponential isothermal coordinate chart''' in the form\n:<math> ds^2 = \\exp(2 \\, p(x,y)) \\, \\left( dx^2 + dy^2 \\right). </math>\n(These coordinates provide an example of a [[conformal map|conformal]] coordinate chart, because angles, but not distances, are correctly represented.)\n\nThe easiest way to compute the [[Ricci tensor]] and [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]] for our Riemannian two-manifold is to use the differential forms method of [[\u00c9lie Cartan]].  Take the '''[[coframe field]]'''\n:<math> \\sigma^1 = \\exp (p) \\, dx, \\; \\; \\sigma^2 = \\exp (p) \\, dy</math>\nso that [[metric tensor]] becomes\n:<math> \\sigma^1 \\otimes \\sigma^1 + \\sigma^2 \\otimes \\sigma^2 = \\exp(2 p) \\, \\left( dx \\otimes dx + dy \\otimes dy \\right). </math>\n\nNext, given an arbitrary smooth function <math>h(x,y)</math>, compute the [[exterior derivative]]\n:<math> d h = h_x dx + h_y dy = \\exp(-p) h_x \\, \\sigma^1 + \\exp(-p) h_y \\, \\sigma^2.</math>\nTake the [[Hodge dual]]\n:<math> \\star d h = -\\exp(-p) h_y \\, \\sigma^1 + \\exp(-p) h_x \\, \\sigma^2 = -h_y \\, dx + h_x \\, dy.</math>\nTake another exterior derivative\n:<math> d \\star d h = -h_{yy} \\, dy \\wedge dx + h_{xx} \\, dx \\wedge dy = \\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\right) \\, dx \\wedge dy </math>\n(where we used the '''anti-commutative property''' of the [[exterior product]]).  That is,\n:<math> d \\star d h = \\exp(-2 p) \\, \\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\right) \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2. </math>\nTaking another Hodge dual gives\n:<math> \\Delta h = \\star d \\star d h = \\exp(-2 p) \\, \\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\right)</math>\nwhich gives the desired expression for the Laplace/Beltrami operator\n:<math> \\Delta = \\exp(-2 \\, p(x,y)) \\left( D_x^2 + D_y^2 \\right). </math>\n\nTo compute the curvature tensor, we take the exterior derivative of the covector fields making up our coframe:\n:<math> d \\sigma^1 = p_y \\exp(p) dy \\wedge dx = -\\left( p_y dx \\right) \\wedge \\sigma^2 = -{\\omega^1}_2 \\wedge \\sigma^2</math>\n:<math> d \\sigma^2 = p_x \\exp(p) dx \\wedge dy = -\\left( p_x dy \\right) \\wedge \\sigma^1 = -{\\omega^2}_1 \\wedge \\sigma^1.</math>\nFrom these expressions, we can read off the only independent '''[[Spin connection]] one-form'''\n:<math> {\\omega^1}_2 = p_y dx - p_x dy,</math>\nwhere we have taken advantage of the anti-symmetric property of the connection (<math>{\\omega^2}_1=-{\\omega^1}_2</math>). Take another exterior derivative\n:<math> d {\\omega^1}_2 = p_{yy} dy \\wedge dx - p_{xx} dx \\wedge dy = -\\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\right) \\, dx \\wedge dy.</math>\nThis gives the '''curvature two-form'''\n:<math> {\\Omega^1}_2 = -\\exp(-2p) \\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\right) \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2 = -\\Delta p \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2</math>\nfrom which we can read off the only linearly independent component of the [[Riemann tensor]] using\n:<math> {\\Omega^1}_2 = {R^1}_{212} \\, \\sigma^1 \\wedge \\sigma^2.</math>\nNamely\n:<math> {R^1}_{212} = -\\Delta p</math>\nfrom which the only nonzero components of the [[Ricci tensor]] are\n:<math> R_{22} = R_{11} = -\\Delta p.</math>\nFrom this, we find components with respect to the '''coordinate cobasis''', namely\n:<math> R_{xx} = R_{yy} = -\\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\right). </math>\n\nBut the metric tensor is also diagonal, with\n:<math> g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\exp (2 p)</math>\nand after some elementary manipulation, we obtain an elegant expression for the Ricci flow:\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\Delta p. </math>\nThis is manifestly analogous to the best known of all diffusion equations, the [[heat equation]]\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\Delta u </math>\nwhere now <math>\\Delta = D_x^2 + D_y^2</math> is the usual [[Laplacian]] on the Euclidean plane.\nThe reader may object that the heat equation is of course a [[linear]] [[partial differential equation]]\u2014where is the promised ''nonlinearity'' in the p.d.e. defining the Ricci flow?\n\nThe answer is that nonlinearity enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric.  But notice that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking <math> p(x,y) = 0</math>.  So if <math>p</math> is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation.  This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out the same way that heat can be carried off \"to infinity\" in an infinite flat plate.  But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to ''homogenize'' the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero.  In the same way, we expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not to turn it into a flat Euclidean geometry.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\nThe Ricci flow has been intensively studied since 1981. Some recent work has focused on the question of precisely how higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds evolve under the Ricci flow, and in particular, what types of parametric [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] may form.  For instance, a certain class of solutions to the Ricci flow demonstrates that '''neckpinch singularities''' will form on an evolving ''n''-dimensional metric Riemannian manifold having a certain topological property (positive [[Euler characteristic]]), as the flow approaches some characteristic time <math>t_{0}</math>.  In certain cases, such neckpinches will produce manifolds called [[Ricci soliton]]s.\n\nFor a 3-dimensional manifold, Perelman showed how to continue past the singularities using [[Poincare conjecture#Ricci flow with surgery|surgery on the manifold]].\n\nK\u00e4hler metrics remain K\u00e4hler under Ricci flow, and so Ricci flow has applications  to the construction of [[K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric]]s.<ref>https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+flow+AND+ricci+AND+Einstein+metric/0/1/0/all/0/1</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n===Applications===\n* [[Uniformization theorem]]\n* [[Geometrization conjecture]]\n* [[Solution of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]\n* [[Differentiable sphere theorem]]\n\n===General context===\n* [[Ricci curvature]]\n* [[Calculus of variations]]\n* [[Geometric flow]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | author=Brendle, Simon | title =Ricci Flow and the Sphere Theorem| publisher=American Mathematical Society | year=2010| isbn=978-0-8218-4938-5 | url=http://www.ams.org/bookstore-getitem/item=GSM-111| author-link =Simon Brendle}}.\n*{{cite journal |arxiv=math.DG/0605667 |author1=Bruce Kleiner |author2-link=John Lott (mathematician) |author2=John Lott |title=Notes on Perelman's papers |year=2008 |doi=10.2140/gt.2008.12.2587 |volume=12 |issue=5 |journal= Geometry & Topology|pages=2587\u20132855|author1-link=Bruce Kleiner }}\n*{{cite journal | first = Huai-Dong | last = Cao | authorlink = Huai-Dong Cao |author2=Xi-Ping Zhu  | title = A Complete Proof of the Poincar\u00e9 and Geometrization Conjectures&nbsp;\u2014 application of the Hamilton-Perelman theory of the Ricci flow | url = http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk/~ajm/vol10/10_2.pdf | journal = Asian Journal of Mathematics | volume = 10 |date=June 2006 | issue =2| author2-link = Xi-Ping Zhu }}    [https://web.archive.org/web/20120514194801/http://www.intlpress.com/AJM/p/2006/10_2/AJM-10-2-Erratum.pdf Erratum].\n** Revised version: {{cite arXiv | eprint=math.DG/0612069 |title=Hamilton-Perelman's Proof of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture and the Geometrization Conjecture | author1=Huai-Dong Cao | author2=Xi-Ping Zhu | year=2006}}\n*{{Citation | editor-last1 = Cao | editor-first1 = H.
