The erect posture causes the weight of the abdominal contents to thrust on the [[pelvic floor]], a complex structure which must not only support this weight but allow, in women, three channels to pass through it: the [[urethra]], the [[vagina]] and the [[rectum]]. The infant's head and shoulders must go through a specific sequence of maneuvers in order to pass through the ring of the mother's pelvis.\n\nSix phases of a typical vertex or [[cephalic presentation|cephalic]] (head-first presentation) delivery:\n# '''Engagement''' of the [[fetal head]] in the transverse position. The baby's head is facing across the pelvis at one or other of the mother's hips.\n# '''Descent and [[flexion]]''' of the fetal head.\n# '''Internal rotation'''. The fetal head rotates 90 degrees to the [[Position (obstetrics)|occipito-anterior position]] so that the baby's face is towards the mother's rectum.\n# '''Delivery by extension'''. The fetal head is bowed, chin on chest, so that the back or crown of its head leads the way through the birth canal, until the back of its neck presses against the pubic bone and its chin leaves its chest, extending the neck\u2014as if to look up, and the rest of its head passes out of the birth canal.\n# '''Restitution'''. The fetal head turns through 45 degrees to restore its normal relationship with the shoulders, which are still at an angle.\n# '''External rotation'''. The shoulders repeat the corkscrew movements of the head, which can be seen in the final movements of the fetal head.\n\nThe vagina is called a 'birth canal' when the baby enters this passage.\n\n'''Station''' refers to the relationship of the fetal presenting part to the level of the ischial spines. When the presenting part is at the ischial spines the station is 0 (synonymous with engagement). If the presenting fetal part is above the spines, the distance is measured and described as minus stations, which range from \u22121 to \u22124&nbsp;cm. If the presenting part is below the ischial spines, the distance is stated as plus stations ( +1 to +4&nbsp;cm).

A scoring system called a [[Bishop score]] can be used to judge the degree of cervical ripening in order to predict the timing of labor and delivery of the infant or for women at risk for preterm labor.  It is also used to judge when a woman will respond to [[induction of labor]] for a postdate pregnancy or other medical reasons.

As pressure on the cervix increases, women may have the sensation of pelvic pressure and an urge to begin pushing. At the beginning of the normal second stage, the head is fully engaged in the pelvis; the widest diameter of the head has passed below the level of the [[pelvic inlet]]. The fetal head then continues descent into the pelvis, below the pubic arch and out through the vaginal [[introitus]] (opening). This is assisted by the additional maternal efforts of \"bearing down\" or pushing. The appearance of the fetal head at the vaginal orifice is termed the \"crowning\".

Mothers were told that their newborn would be safer in the nursery and that the separation would offer the mother more time to rest.  As attitudes began to change, some hospitals offered a \"rooming in\" option wherein after a period of routine hospital procedures and observation, the infant could be allowed to share the mother's room.  However, more recent information has begun to question the standard practice of removing the newborn immediately postpartum for routine postnatal procedures before being returned to the mother.  Beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) may benefit both mother and infant.  Using animal studies that have shown that the intimate contact inherent in skin-to-skin contact promotes neurobehaviors that result in the fulfillment of basic biological needs as a model, recent studies have been done to assess what, if any, advantages may be associated with early skin-to-skin contact for human mothers and their babies. A 2011 medical review looked at existing studies and found that early skin-to-skin contact, sometimes called [[kangaroo care]], resulted in improved [[breastfeeding]] outcomes, cardio-respiratory stability, and a decrease in infant crying.<ref name=\"WHO skin-to-skin 2008\">{{cite web | url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/archives/hscom2/en/index.html | title=Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants | work=The WHO Reproductive Health Library | publisher=WHO | date=4 January 2008 | access-date=23 December 2014 |  vauthors = Saloojee H | url-status=live | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141221025957/http://apps.who.int/rhl/archives/hscom2/en/index.html | archive-date=21 December 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"The Journal of Perinatal Education\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Crenshaw J | title = Care practice #6: no separation of mother and baby, with unlimited opportunities for breastfeeding | journal = The Journal of Perinatal Education | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 39\u201343 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18566647 | pmc = 1948089 | doi = 10.1624/105812407X217147 }}</ref> A 2016 [[Cochrane review]] found that skin-to-skin contact at birth promotes the likelihood and effectiveness of breastfeeding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore ER, Bergman N, Anderson GC, Medley N | title = Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD003519 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27885658 | pmc = 3979156 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003519.pub4 }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, early postpartum skin-to-skin contact is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants, including the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref name=\"Medscape\">{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806325_9 | title=Uninterrupted Skin-to-Skin Contact Immediately After Birth | website=Medscape | access-date=21 December 2014 | author=Phillips, Raylene | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403065140/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806325_9 | archive-date=3 April 2015 }}</ref>  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states that \"the process of\nchildbirth is not finished until the baby has safely transferred from placental to mammary nutrition.\"  They advise that the newborn be placed skin-to-skin with the mother, postponing any routine procedures for at least one to two hours.

Women experienced less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days with no difference in occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang H, Qian X, Carroli G, Garner P | title = Selective versus routine use of episiotomy for vaginal birth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD000081 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28176333 | pmc = 5449575 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000081.pub3 }}</ref>\n\n===Instrumental delivery===\n[[Obstetric forceps]] or [[ventouse]] may be used to facilitate childbirth.\n\n===Multiple births===\n{{Main|Multiple birth}}\nIn cases of a [[cephalic presentation|head first-presenting]] first twin, twins can often be delivered vaginally.

Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of labour as well as women's feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, [[doula]]s, or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network.  There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety.<ref>{{cite web |title= Men At Birth \u2013 Should Your Bloke Be There? |url= http://www.bellybelly.com.au/birth/men-at-birth |work= BellyBelly.com.au | vauthors = Vernon D |access-date= 2013-08-23 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130601041645/http://www.bellybelly.com.au/birth/men-at-birth |archive-date= 2013-06-01 }}</ref>\n\nContinuous labour support may help women to give birth spontaneously, i.e. without caesarean or vacuum or forceps, with slightly shorter labours, and to have more positive feelings regarding their experience of giving birth.

Globally it occurs about 8.7 million times and results in 44,000 to 86,000 deaths per year.  Uterine atony, the inability of the uterus to contract, is the most common cause of postpartum bleeding.  Following delivery of the placenta, the uterus is left with a large area of open blood vessels which must be constricted to avoid blood loss.  Retained placental tissue and infection may contribute to uterine atony.  Heavy blood loss leads to [[hypovolemic shock]], insufficient perfusion of vital organs and death if not rapidly treated.\n\n====Postpartum infections====\n{{Main|Postpartum infections}}\nPostpartum infections, also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever, are any bacterial infections of the reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage.  Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (100.4&nbsp;\u00b0F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge.  The infection usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.  Infection remains a major cause of maternal deaths and morbidity in the developing world.

Male physicians began to replace female midwives in Europe and the United States in the 1700s. The rise in status and popularity of this new position was accompanied by a drop in status for midwives. By the 1800s, affluent families were primarily calling male doctors to assist with their deliveries, and female midwives were seen as a resource for women who could not afford better care. That completely removed women from assisting in labor, as only men were eligible to become doctors at the time. Additionally, it privatized the birthing process as family members and friends were often banned from the delivery room.\n\nThere was opposition to the change from both progressive feminists and religious conservatives. The feminists were concerned about job security for a role that had traditionally been held by women. The conservatives argued that it was immoral for a woman to be exposed in such a way in front of a man. For that reason, many male obstetricians performed deliveries in dark rooms or with their patient fully covered with a drape. As one author puts it, \"since the 1920s, physicians have been the unchallenged birth attendants.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Medication ===\nThe use of pain medication in labor has been a controversial issue for hundreds of years. A Scottish woman was burned at the stake in 1591 for requesting pain relief in the delivery of twins. Medication became more acceptable in 1852, when Queen Victoria used chloroform as pain relief during labor. The use of [[morphine]] and [[scopolamine]], also known as \"[[twilight sleep]],\" was first used in Germany and popularized by German physicians Bernard Kronig and Karl Gauss. This concoction offered minor pain relief but mostly allowed women to completely forget the entire delivery process. Under twilight sleep, mothers were often blindfolded and restrained as they experienced the immense pain of childbirth. The cocktail came with severe side effects, such as decreased uterine contractions and altered mental state. Additionally, babies delivered with the use of childbirth drugs often experienced temporarily-ceased breathing. The feminist movement in the United States openly and actively supported the use of twilight sleep, which was introduced to the country in 1914. Some physicians, many of whom had been using painkillers for the past fifty years, including opium, cocaine, and quinine, embraced the new drug. Others were rightfully hesitant.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Forceps ===\nIn the late 16th century, the Chamberlen family developed obstetric forceps for safely delivering babies in compromised positions. They kept this design a family secret for two hundred years. Before forceps, babies stuck in the birth canal almost always faced imminent death\u2014the mother's life was typically spared at the expense of the baby. After many generations, a Chamberlen offspring decided to go public with the design. By the 1800s, midwives and doctors began using forceps, although with strong hesitation at first. In 1908, a Harvard-graduated OB/GYN, Franklin S. Newell, publicly recommended that forceps be used for upper-class women, who he considered too physically and emotionally weak to naturally deliver a baby.<ref name=\":0\" /> The use of tools and medication was highly encouraged for use in all deliveries by American physician Joseph Bolivar DeLee in the 1920s. This received major backlash from the medical community, with some claiming that DeLee's advice to use forceps when not medically necessary resulted in \"many unnecessary deaths.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Caesarean sections ===\nWhile forceps have gone through periods of high popularity, today they are only used in approximately 10 percent of deliveries. The [[Caesarean section|caesarean section (or C-section)]] has become the more popular solution for difficult deliveries. In 2005, one-third of babies were born via C-section. Historically, surgical delivery was a last-resort method of extracting a baby from its deceased or dying mother. There are many conflicting stories of the first successful C-section in which both mom and baby survived. It is, however, known that the procedure had been attempted for hundreds of years before it became accepted in the beginning of the twentieth century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn some Western societies, [[caesarean section]] is becoming more commonplace as vaginal births are seen by some as more difficult and painful.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Natal signs : cultural representations of pregnancy, birth and parenting | last = Burton | first = Nadya | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015|publisher=Demeter Press|isbn=9781926452326|oclc=949328683}}</ref> However, some also view them as stigmatized, or an undesirable alternative to \"natural\" birth, unassisted birth, and other non-surgical or less-interventionist approaches to birth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Howorth |first1=Claire | name-list-format = vanc |title=Motherhood Is Hard to Get Wrong.

Most women in Amish societies find the pain and effort of childbirth satisfactory.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Natural childbirth ===\nThe re-emergence of \"natural childbirth\" began in Europe and was adopted by some in the US as early as the late 1940s. Early supporters believed that the drugs used during deliveries interfered with \"happy childbirth\" and could negatively impact the newborn's \"emotional wellbeing.\" By the 1970s, the call for natural childbirth was spread nationwide, in conjunction with [[Second-wave feminism|the second-wave of the feminist movement.]]<ref name=\":0\" /> While it is still most common for American women to deliver in the hospital, supporters of natural birth still widely exist, especially in the UK where midwife-assisted home births have gained popularity in recent years.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Maternal mortality ===\nChildbirth statistics in the US before 1915 were not recorded, but moving forward, the US has had historically poor maternal mortality rates in comparison to other developed countries. There is more reliable data on maternal mortality from Britain from 1880 onward. Outcomes for mothers in childbirth were especially poor before 1930 because of high rates of [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Until [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] was accepted in the mid-1800s, it was assumed that puerperal fever was either caused by a variety of sources, including the leakage of breast milk into the body and anxiety, rather than by a pathogen that was transmitted by the dirty hands and tools of doctors. That misconception was likely responsible for the high prevalence of puerperal fever.<ref name=\":0\" /> The home births facilitated by trained midwives produced the best outcomes from 1880 to 1930 in the US and Europe, whereas physician-facilitated hospital births produced the worst. The change in trend of maternal mortality can be attributed with the widespread use of [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], along with the progression of medical technology, more extensive physician training, and less medical interference with normal deliveries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:Miniature Naissance Louis VIII.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Medieval woman, having given birth, enjoying her [[lying-in]] ([[postpartum confinement]]).

There has been research considering negative effects of maternal evacuation due to a lack of social support provided to these women. These negative effects include an increase in maternal newborn complications and postpartum depression, and decreased breastfeeding rates.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe [[locus in quo|exact location]] in which childbirth takes place is an important factor in determining nationality, in particular for [[birth aboard aircraft and ships]].\n\n===Facilities===\nFollowing are facilities that are particularly intended to house women during childbirth:\n* A ''labour ward'', also called a ''delivery ward'' or ''labour and delivery'', is generally a [[Hospital department|department of a hospital]] that focuses on providing [[health care]] to women and their children during childbirth. It is generally closely linked to the hospital's [[neonatal intensive care unit]] and/or [[obstetric surgery]] unit if present. A ''maternity ward'' or ''maternity unit'' may include facilities both for childbirth and for [[postpartum]] rest and observation of mothers in normal as well as complicated cases.\n* A [[maternity hospital]] is a hospital that specializes in caring for women while they are pregnant and during childbirth and provide care for newborn babies,\n* A [[birthing center]] generally presents a simulated home-like environment. Birthing centers may be located on hospital grounds or \"free standing\" (i.e., not hospital-affiliated).\n* In addition, it is possible to have a [[home birth]], usually with the assist of a midwife.  However, some women choose to give birth at home without any professionals present, termed an [[unassisted childbirth]].\n\n===Associated occupations===\n[[File:Modelo-de-quadril.jpg|thumb|Model of pelvis used in the beginning of the 19th century to teach technical procedures for a successful childbirth. Museum of the History of Medicine, [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]]]]\n\nDifferent categories of [[birth attendant]]s may provide support and care during pregnancy and childbirth, although there are important differences across categories based on professional training and skills, practice regulations, and the nature of care delivered. Many of these occupations are highly professionalised, but other roles exist on a less formal basis.\n\n\"Childbirth educators\" are instructors who aim to teach pregnant women and their partners about the nature of pregnancy, labour signs and stages, techniques for giving birth, breastfeeding and newborn baby care. Training for this role can be found in hospital settings or through independent certifying organizations. Each organization teaches its own curriculum and each emphasizes different techniques. The [[Lamaze technique]] is one well-known example.\n\n[[Doula]]s are assistants who support mothers during pregnancy, labour, birth, and postpartum. They are not medical attendants; rather, they provide emotional support and non-medical pain relief for women during labour. Like childbirth educators and other [[unlicensed assistive personnel]], certification to become a doula is not compulsory, thus, anyone can call themself a doula or a childbirth educator.\n\n[[Nanny#Types of nanny|Confinement nannies]] are individuals who are employed to provide assistance and stay with the mothers at their home after childbirth. They are usually experienced mothers who took courses on how to take care of mothers and newborn babies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nannysos.com.sg/what-is-a-confinement-nanny/|title=What Is A Confinement Nanny|work=NannySOS|access-date=22 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151702/http://www.nannysos.com.sg/what-is-a-confinement-nanny/|archive-date=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Midwifery|Midwives]] are autonomous practitioners who provide basic and emergency health care before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, generally to women with low-risk pregnancies. Midwives are trained to assist during labour and birth, either through direct-entry or nurse-midwifery education programs.

Although western civilizations attempted to assimilate their birthing technologies into certain indigenous societies, like [[Turtle Islands, Tawi-Tawi|Turtle Island]], and get rid of the midwifery, the National Aboriginal Council of Midwives brought back the cultural ideas and midwifery that were once associated with indigenous birthing.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn jurisdictions where midwifery is not a regulated profession, [[traditional birth attendant]]s, also known as traditional or lay midwives, may assist women during childbirth, although they do not typically receive formal health care education and training.\n\n[[Doctor of Medicine|Medical doctors]] who practice in the field of childbirth include categorically specialized [[obstetrics|obstetricians]], [[family medicine|family practitioners]] and [[general practice|general practitioners]] whose training, skills and practices include obstetrics, and in some contexts [[general surgeon]]s. These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions. Categorically specialized obstetricians are qualified [[surgeon]]s, so they can undertake surgical procedures relating to childbirth. Some family practitioners or general practitioners also perform obstetrical surgery. Obstetrical procedures include [[cesarean section]]s, [[episiotomy|episiotomies]], and assisted delivery. Categorical specialists in obstetrics are commonly trained in both [[obstetrics and gynecology]] (OB/GYN), and may provide other medical and surgical gynecological care, and may incorporate more general, well-woman, [[primary care]] elements in their practices. [[Maternal-fetal medicine]] specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery.\n\n[[Anaesthetists]] or [[anesthesiologists]] are medical doctors who specialise in pain relief and the use of drugs to facilitate surgery and other painful procedures. They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing an [[epidural]] or by providing [[anaesthesia]] (often [[spinal anaesthesia]]) for [[Cesarean section]] or [[forceps delivery]]. They are experts in [[pain management during childbirth]].\n\n[[Obstetrics gynecology nursing|Obstetric nurses]] assist midwives, doctors, women, and babies before, during, and after the birth process, in the hospital system. They hold various [[Nursing board certification|nursing certifications]] and typically undergo additional obstetric training in addition to standard [[Nursing school|nursing training]].\n\n[[Paramedic]]s are healthcare providers that are able to provide emergency care to both the mother and infant during and after delivery using a wide range of medications and tools on an ambulance. They are capable of delivering babies but can do very little for infants that become \"stuck\" and are unable to be delivered vaginally.\n\n[[Lactation consultant]]s assist the mother and newborn to [[breastfeed]] successfully. A [[health visitor]] comes to see the mother and baby at home, usually within 24 hours of discharge, and checks the infant's [[adaptation to extrauterine life]] and the mother's [[postpartum physiological changes]].\n\n=== Non-western communities ===\nCultural values, assumptions, and practices of pregnancy and childbirth vary across cultures. For example, some [[Maya peoples#Guatemala|Maya]] women who work in agricultural fields of some rural communities will usually continue to work in a similar function to how they normally would throughout pregnancy, in some cases working until labor begins.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Developing destinies : a Mayan midwife and town|last=Barbara|first=Rogoff | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531990-3|oclc=779676136}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Comfort]] and proximity to extended family and social support systems may be a childbirth priority of many communities in developing countries, such as the Chillihuani in Peru and the Mayan town of San Pedro La Laguna.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Growing up in a culture of respect child rearing in highland Peru|last=Inge|first=Bolin | name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|oclc=748863692}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref> Home births can help women in these cultures feel more comfortable as they are in their own home with their family around them helping out in different ways.<ref name=\":6\" /> Traditionally, it has been rare in these cultures for the mother to lie down during childbirth, opting instead for standing, kneeling, or walking around prior to and during birthing.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nSome communities rely heavily on religion for their birthing practices. It is believed that if certain acts are carried out, then it will allow the child for a healthier and happier future. One example of this is the belief in the Chillihuani that if a knife or scissors are used for cutting the [[umbilical cord]], it will cause for the child to go through clothes very quickly. In order to prevent this, a jagged ceramic tile is used to cut the umbilical cord.<ref name=\":7\" /> In Mayan societies, ceremonial gifts are presented to the mother throughout pregnancy and childbirth in order to help her into the beginning of her child's life.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Collecting stem cells===\nIt is currently possible to collect two types of [[stem cells]] during childbirth: [[amniotic stem cells]] and umbilical [[cord blood]] stem cells.<ref name=Dz2016/> They are being studied as possible treatments of a number of conditions.<ref name=Dz2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dziadosz M, Basch RS, Young BK | title = Human amniotic fluid: a source of stem cells for possible therapeutic use | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 214 | issue = 3 | pages = 321\u201327 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26767797 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2015.12.061 }}</ref>\n\n=== Other aspects ===\nIn many countries, age is reckoned from the date of birth, and sometimes the birthday is celebrated annually. [[East Asian age reckoning]] starts newborns at \"1\", incrementing each [[Lunar calendar|Lunar New Year]].\n\nSome cultures view the [[placenta]] as a special part of birth, since it has been the child's life support for so many months.

The erect posture causes the weight of the abdominal contents to thrust on the [[pelvic floor]], a complex structure which must not only support this weight but allow, in women, three channels to pass through it: the [[urethra]], the [[vagina]] and the [[rectum]]. The infant's head and shoulders must go through a specific sequence of maneuvers in order to pass through the ring of the mother's pelvis.\n\nSix phases of a typical vertex or [[cephalic presentation|cephalic]] (head-first presentation) delivery:\n# '''Engagement''' of the [[fetal head]] in the transverse position. The baby's head is facing across the pelvis at one or other of the mother's hips.\n# '''Descent and [[flexion]]''' of the fetal head.\n# '''Internal rotation'''. The fetal head rotates 90 degrees to the [[Position (obstetrics)|occipito-anterior position]] so that the baby's face is towards the mother's rectum.\n# '''Delivery by extension'''. The fetal head is bowed, chin on chest, so that the back or crown of its head leads the way through the birth canal, until the back of its neck presses against the pubic bone and its chin leaves its chest, extending the neck\u2014as if to look up, and the rest of its head passes out of the birth canal.\n# '''Restitution'''. The fetal head turns through 45 degrees to restore its normal relationship with the shoulders, which are still at an angle.\n# '''External rotation'''. The shoulders repeat the corkscrew movements of the head, which can be seen in the final movements of the fetal head.\n\nThe vagina is called a 'birth canal' when the baby enters this passage.\n\n'''Station''' refers to the relationship of the fetal presenting part to the level of the ischial spines. When the presenting part is at the ischial spines the station is 0 (synonymous with engagement). If the presenting fetal part is above the spines, the distance is measured and described as minus stations, which range from \u22121 to \u22124&nbsp;cm. If the presenting part is below the ischial spines, the distance is stated as plus stations ( +1 to +4&nbsp;cm).

However, the duration of active first stage (from 5 cm until full cervical dilatation) usually does not extend beyond 12 hours in first labours (\"primiparae\"), and usually does not extend beyond 10 hours in subsequent labours (\"multiparae\").

As pressure on the cervix increases, women may have the sensation of pelvic pressure and an urge to begin pushing. At the beginning of the normal second stage, the head is fully engaged in the pelvis; the widest diameter of the head has passed below the level of the [[pelvic inlet]]. The fetal head then continues descent into the pelvis, below the pubic arch and out through the vaginal [[introitus]] (opening). This is assisted by the additional maternal efforts of \"bearing down\" or pushing. The appearance of the fetal head at the vaginal orifice is termed the \"crowning\".  At this point, the woman will feel an intense burning or stinging sensation.\n\nWhen the [[amniotic sac]] has not ruptured during labour or pushing, the infant can be born with the membranes intact. This is referred to as \"delivery en [[caul]]\".\n\nComplete expulsion of the baby signals the successful completion of the second stage of labour.\n\nThe second stage varies from one woman to another. In first labours, birth is usually completed within three hours whereas in subsequent\nlabours, birth is usually completed within two hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO recommendations Intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience (item #33)|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/260178/9789241550215-eng.pdf?sequence=1|website=World Health Organization|access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref>  Labours longer than three hours are associated with declining rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery and increasing rates of infection, [[perineal tear]]s, and obstetric hemorrhage, as well as the need for intensive care of the neonate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rouse DJ, Weiner SJ, Bloom SL, Varner MW, Spong CY, Ramin SM, Caritis SN, Peaceman AM, Sorokin Y, Sciscione A, Carpenter MW, Mercer BM, Thorp JM, Malone FD, Harper M, Iams JD, Anderson GD | title = Second-stage labor duration in nulliparous women: relationship to maternal and perinatal outcomes | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 201 | issue = 4 | pages = 357.e1\u20137 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19788967 | pmc = 2768280 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2009.08.003 | author18 = Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network | displayauthors = 4 }}</ref>\n\n===Third stage: placenta delivery===\n{{Further|Umbilical cord|Placental expulsion}}\n\nThe period from just after the fetus is expelled until just after the placenta is expelled is called the ''third stage of labour'' or the ''involution stage''.

Mothers were told that their newborn would be safer in the nursery and that the separation would offer the mother more time to rest.  As attitudes began to change, some hospitals offered a \"rooming in\" option wherein after a period of routine hospital procedures and observation, the infant could be allowed to share the mother's room.  However, more recent information has begun to question the standard practice of removing the newborn immediately postpartum for routine postnatal procedures before being returned to the mother.  Beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) may benefit both mother and infant.  Using animal studies that have shown that the intimate contact inherent in skin-to-skin contact promotes neurobehaviors that result in the fulfillment of basic biological needs as a model, recent studies have been done to assess what, if any, advantages may be associated with early skin-to-skin contact for human mothers and their babies.

Globally it occurs about 8.7 million times and results in 44,000 to 86,000 deaths per year.  Uterine atony, the inability of the uterus to contract, is the most common cause of postpartum bleeding.  Following delivery of the placenta, the uterus is left with a large area of open blood vessels which must be constricted to avoid blood loss.  Retained placental tissue and infection may contribute to uterine atony.  Heavy blood loss leads to [[hypovolemic shock]], insufficient perfusion of vital organs and death if not rapidly treated.\n\n====Postpartum infections====\n{{Main|Postpartum infections}}\nPostpartum infections, also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever, are any bacterial infections of the reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage.  Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (100.4&nbsp;\u00b0F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge.  The infection usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.  Infection remains a major cause of maternal deaths and morbidity in the developing world. The work of [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] was seminal in the pathophysiology and treatment of childbed fever and his work saved many lives.\n\n====Psychological complications====\n{{Main|Psychiatric disorders of childbirth|Postpartum psychosis|Postpartum depression|Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder|Maternity blues}}\n\nChildbirth can be an intense event and strong emotions, both positive and negative, can be brought to the surface.

Babies require a lot of care, so it is normal for mothers to be worried about, or tired from, providing that care.

Male physicians began to replace female midwives in Europe and the United States in the 1700s. The rise in status and popularity of this new position was accompanied by a drop in status for midwives. By the 1800s, affluent families were primarily calling male doctors to assist with their deliveries, and female midwives were seen as a resource for women who could not afford better care. That completely removed women from assisting in labor, as only men were eligible to become doctors at the time. Additionally, it privatized the birthing process as family members and friends were often banned from the delivery room.\n\nThere was opposition to the change from both progressive feminists and religious conservatives. The feminists were concerned about job security for a role that had traditionally been held by women. The conservatives argued that it was immoral for a woman to be exposed in such a way in front of a man. For that reason, many male obstetricians performed deliveries in dark rooms or with their patient fully covered with a drape. As one author puts it, \"since the 1920s, physicians have been the unchallenged birth attendants.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Medication ===\nThe use of pain medication in labor has been a controversial issue for hundreds of years. A Scottish woman was burned at the stake in 1591 for requesting pain relief in the delivery of twins. Medication became more acceptable in 1852, when Queen Victoria used chloroform as pain relief during labor. The use of [[morphine]] and [[scopolamine]], also known as \"[[twilight sleep]],\" was first used in Germany and popularized by German physicians Bernard Kronig and Karl Gauss. This concoction offered minor pain relief but mostly allowed women to completely forget the entire delivery process. Under twilight sleep, mothers were often blindfolded and restrained as they experienced the immense pain of childbirth. The cocktail came with severe side effects, such as decreased uterine contractions and altered mental state. Additionally, babies delivered with the use of childbirth drugs often experienced temporarily-ceased breathing. The feminist movement in the United States openly and actively supported the use of twilight sleep, which was introduced to the country in 1914. Some physicians, many of whom had been using painkillers for the past fifty years, including opium, cocaine, and quinine, embraced the new drug. Others were rightfully hesitant.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Forceps ===\nIn the late 16th century, the Chamberlen family developed obstetric forceps for safely delivering babies in compromised positions. They kept this design a family secret for two hundred years. Before forceps, babies stuck in the birth canal almost always faced imminent death\u2014the mother's life was typically spared at the expense of the baby. After many generations, a Chamberlen offspring decided to go public with the design. By the 1800s, midwives and doctors began using forceps, although with strong hesitation at first. In 1908, a Harvard-graduated OB/GYN, Franklin S. Newell, publicly recommended that forceps be used for upper-class women, who he considered too physically and emotionally weak to naturally deliver a baby.<ref name=\":0\" /> The use of tools and medication was highly encouraged for use in all deliveries by American physician Joseph Bolivar DeLee in the 1920s. This received major backlash from the medical community, with some claiming that DeLee's advice to use forceps when not medically necessary resulted in \"many unnecessary deaths.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Caesarean sections ===\nWhile forceps have gone through periods of high popularity, today they are only used in approximately 10 percent of deliveries. The [[Caesarean section|caesarean section (or C-section)]] has become the more popular solution for difficult deliveries. In 2005, one-third of babies were born via C-section. Historically, surgical delivery was a last-resort method of extracting a baby from its deceased or dying mother. There are many conflicting stories of the first successful C-section in which both mom and baby survived. It is, however, known that the procedure had been attempted for hundreds of years before it became accepted in the beginning of the twentieth century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn some Western societies, [[caesarean section]] is becoming more commonplace as vaginal births are seen by some as more difficult and painful.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Natal signs : cultural representations of pregnancy, birth and parenting | last = Burton | first = Nadya | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015|publisher=Demeter Press|isbn=9781926452326|oclc=949328683}}</ref> However, some also view them as stigmatized, or an undesirable alternative to \"natural\" birth, unassisted birth, and other non-surgical or less-interventionist approaches to birth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Howorth |first1=Claire | name-list-format = vanc |title=Motherhood Is Hard to Get Wrong.

Most women in Amish societies find the pain and effort of childbirth satisfactory.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Natural childbirth ===\nThe re-emergence of \"natural childbirth\" began in Europe and was adopted by some in the US as early as the late 1940s. Early supporters believed that the drugs used during deliveries interfered with \"happy childbirth\" and could negatively impact the newborn's \"emotional wellbeing.\" By the 1970s, the call for natural childbirth was spread nationwide, in conjunction with [[Second-wave feminism|the second-wave of the feminist movement.]]<ref name=\":0\" /> While it is still most common for American women to deliver in the hospital, supporters of natural birth still widely exist, especially in the UK where midwife-assisted home births have gained popularity in recent years.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Maternal mortality ===\nChildbirth statistics in US before 1915 were not recorded, but moving forward, the US has had historically poor maternal mortality rates in comparison to other developed countries. There is more reliable data on maternal mortality from Britain from 1880 onward. Outcomes for mothers in childbirth were especially poor before 1930 because of high rates of [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Until [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] was accepted in the mid-1800s, it was assumed that puerperal fever was either caused by a variety of sources, including the leakage of breast milk into the body and anxiety, rather than by a pathogen that was transmitted by the dirty hands and tools of doctors. That misconception was likely responsible for the high prevalence of puerperal fever.<ref name=\":0\" /> The home births facilitated by trained midwives produced the best outcomes from 1880 to 1930 in the US and Europe, whereas physician-facilitated hospital births produced the worst. The change in trend of maternal mortality can be attributed with the widespread use of [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], along with the progression of medical technology, more extensive physician training, and less medical interference with normal deliveries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:Miniature Naissance Louis VIII.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Medieval woman, having given birth, enjoying her [[lying-in]] ([[postpartum confinement]]).

The summed cost of prenatal care, childbirth, and newborn care came to $30,000 for a vaginal delivery and $50,000 for a caesarian section.\n\nIn the United States, childbirth hospital stays have some of the lowest ICU utilizations.  Vaginal delivery with and without complicating diagnoses and caesarean section with and without comorbidities or major comorbidities account for four of the 15 types of hospital stays with low rates of ICU utilization (where less than 20% of visits were admitted to the ICU).

It is generally closely linked to the hospital's [[neonatal intensive care unit]] and/or [[obstetric surgery]] unit if present. A ''maternity ward'' or ''maternity unit'' may include facilities both for childbirth and for [[postpartum]] rest and observation of mothers in normal as well as complicated cases.\n* A [[maternity hospital]] is a hospital that specializes in caring for women while they are pregnant and during childbirth and provide care for newborn babies,\n* A [[birthing center]] generally presents a simulated home-like environment. Birthing centers may be located on hospital grounds or \"free standing\" (i.e., not hospital-affiliated).\n* In addition, it is possible to have a [[home birth]], usually with the assist of a midwife.  However, some women choose to give birth at home without any professionals present, termed an [[unassisted childbirth]].\n\n===Associated occupations===\n[[File:Modelo-de-quadril.jpg|thumb|Model of pelvis used in the beginning of the 19th century to teach technical procedures for a successful childbirth. Museum of the History of Medicine, [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]]]]\n\nDifferent categories of [[birth attendant]]s may provide support and care during pregnancy and childbirth, although there are important differences across categories based on professional training and skills, practice regulations, and the nature of care delivered. Many of these occupations are highly professionalised, but other roles exist on a less formal basis.\n\n\"Childbirth educators\" are instructors who aim to teach pregnant women and their partners about the nature of pregnancy, labour signs and stages, techniques for giving birth, breastfeeding and newborn baby care. Training for this role can be found in hospital settings or through independent certifying organizations. Each organization teaches its own curriculum and each emphasizes different techniques. The [[Lamaze technique]] is one well-known example.\n\n[[Doula]]s are assistants who support mothers during pregnancy, labour, birth, and postpartum. They are not medical attendants; rather, they provide emotional support and non-medical pain relief for women during labour. Like childbirth educators and other [[unlicensed assistive personnel]], certification to become a doula is not compulsory, thus, anyone can call themself a doula or a childbirth educator.\n\n[[Nanny#Types of nanny|Confinement nannies]] are individuals who are employed to provide assistance and stay with the mothers at their home after childbirth.

[[Maternal-fetal medicine]] specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery.\n\n[[Anaesthetists]] or [[anesthesiologists]] are medical doctors who specialise in pain relief and the use of drugs to facilitate surgery and other painful procedures. They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing an [[epidural]] or by providing [[anaesthesia]] (often [[spinal anaesthesia]]) for [[Cesarean section]] or [[forceps delivery]]. They are experts in [[pain management during childbirth]].\n\n[[Obstetrics gynecology nursing|Obstetric nurses]] assist midwives, doctors, women, and babies before, during, and after the birth process, in the hospital system. They hold various [[Nursing board certification|nursing certifications]] and typically undergo additional obstetric training in addition to standard [[Nursing school|nursing training]].\n\n[[Paramedic]]s are healthcare providers that are able to provide emergency care to both the mother and infant during and after delivery using a wide range of medications and tools on an ambulance. They are capable of delivering babies but can do very little for infants that become \"stuck\" and are unable to be delivered vaginally.\n\n[[Lactation consultant]]s assist the mother and newborn to [[breastfeed]] successfully. A [[health visitor]] comes to see the mother and baby at home, usually within 24 hours of discharge, and checks the infant's [[adaptation to extrauterine life]] and the mother's [[postpartum physiological changes]].\n\n=== Non-western communities ===\nCultural values, assumptions, and practices of pregnancy and childbirth vary across cultures. For example, some [[Maya peoples#Guatemala|Maya]] women who work in agricultural fields of some rural communities will usually continue to work in a similar function to how they normally would throughout pregnancy, in some cases working until labor begins.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Developing destinies : a Mayan midwife and town|last=Barbara|first=Rogoff | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531990-3|oclc=779676136}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Comfort]] and proximity to extended family and social support systems may be a childbirth priority of many communities in developing countries, such as the Chillihuani in Peru and the Mayan town of San Pedro La Laguna.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Growing up in a culture of respect child rearing in highland Peru|last=Inge|first=Bolin | name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|oclc=748863692}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref> Home births can help women in these cultures feel more comfortable as they are in their own home with their family around them helping out in different ways.<ref name=\":6\" /> Traditionally, it has been rare in these cultures for the mother to lie down during childbirth, opting instead for standing, kneeling, or walking around prior to and during birthing.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nSome communities rely heavily on religion for their birthing practices. It is believed that if certain acts are carried out, then it will allow the child for a healthier and happier future. One example of this is the belief in the Chillihuani that if a knife or scissors are used for cutting the [[umbilical cord]], it will cause for the child to go through clothes very quickly. In order to prevent this, a jagged ceramic tile is used to cut the umbilical cord.<ref name=\":7\" /> In Mayan societies, ceremonial gifts are presented to the mother throughout pregnancy and childbirth in order to help her into the beginning of her child's life.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Collecting stem cells===\nIt is currently possible to collect two types of [[stem cells]] during childbirth: [[amniotic stem cells]] and umbilical [[cord blood]] stem cells.<ref name=Dz2016/> They are being studied as possible treatments of a number of conditions.<ref name=Dz2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dziadosz M, Basch RS, Young BK | title = Human amniotic fluid: a source of stem cells for possible therapeutic use | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 214 | issue = 3 | pages = 321\u201327 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26767797 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2015.12.061 }}</ref>\n\n=== Other aspects ===\nIn many countries, age is reckoned from the date of birth, and sometimes the birthday is celebrated annually. [[East Asian age reckoning]] starts newborns at \"1\", incrementing each [[Lunar calendar|Lunar New Year]].\n\nSome cultures view the [[placenta]] as a special part of birth, since it has been the child's life support for so many months. The [[human placentophagy|placenta may be eaten]] by the newborn's family, ceremonially, for nutrition, or otherwise.<ref>{{cite book|title=Having a Great Birth in Australia: Twenty Stories of Triumph, Power, Love and Delight from the Women and Men who Brought New Life Into the World|publisher=[[Australian College of Midwives]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9751674-3-4| veditors = Vernon DM |editor-link=David Vernon (writer)|location=Canberra, Australia|page=56|title-link=Having a Great Birth in Australia}}</ref> (Some animal mothers eat their afterbirth; this is called [[placentophagy]].)
