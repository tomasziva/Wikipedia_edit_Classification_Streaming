In particular, he developed an antipathy for the Keeper of Printed Books, [[Anthony Panizzi]] (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him, as the \"respectable Sub-Librarian\", in a footnote to an article published in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.<ref>Wells 1991, pp. 26\u201331.</ref> Carlyle's eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private subscription library from which books could be borrowed.\n\n[[File:Narrow London Library label.jpg|right|thumb|19th-century London Library book label]]\nThe [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]] was the Library's first President, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] its first auditor, and [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] and Sir [[Edward Bunbury]] sat on the first committee. The Belgian freedom fighter and former Louvain librarian [[Sylvain Van de Weyer]] was a vice-president from 1848 to 1874. (Van de Weyer's father-in-law [[Joshua Bates (financier)|Joshua Bates]] was a founder of the [[Boston Public Library]] in 1852.)\n\nA vigorous and long-serving presence in later Victorian times was [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton-Milnes]], later Lord Houghton, a friend of [[Florence Nightingale]]. [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] was among the founder members. In more recent times, [[Kenneth Clark]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] have been among the Library's presidents, and Sir [[Harold Nicolson]], Sir [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] and the [[Michael Langhorne Astor|Hon Michael Astor]] have been Chairmen.\n\n(Sir) [[Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright|Charles Hagberg Wright]], who served as Secretary and Librarian from 1893 to 1940, is remembered as \"the real architect of the London Library as it is today\".<ref>''[http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/aboutus/history.htm A brief history of the library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221013847/http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/aboutus/history.htm |date=21 February 2010 }}''.

At that time, most publishers donated free copies of their books to the library. The final appeal was turned down by the [[Court of Appeal]] in 1959, and a letter in ''The Times'' of 5 November from the President and Chairman ([[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Rupert Hart-Davis]]) appealed for funds. An auction of manuscripts from many authors on 22 June 1960 raised \u00a317,000 and \u00a325,000 respectively; enough to clear debts and legal expenses of \u00a320,000. At the sale [[T. E. Lawrence]] items from his brother fetched \u00a33,800, Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]'' fetched \u00a32,800, and [[Lytton Strachey]]'s ''Queen Victoria'' \u00a31,800, though 170 inscribed books and pamphlets from [[John Masefield]] fetched only \u00a3200, which Hart-Davis thought \"shamefully low\".

The social sciences are more lightly covered. Pure and natural sciences, technology, medicine and law are not within the library's purview, although it has some books in all of those fields; books on their histories are normally acquired. [[Periodical publication|Periodicals]] and annuals on a wide range of subjects are also held in the collections. Special collections include subjects of hunting, field sports, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and of Jewish interest.<ref name=\"Skyhorse Publishing\">{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, New York}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the Library lost some 16,000 volumes to bomb damage, and in 1970 its few [[incunable|incunabula]] were sold. With those exceptions, it has (apart from some duplicates) retained all items acquired since its foundation. The Library now holds more than one million items, and each year, it acquires approximately 8,000 new books and periodicals.<ref name=\"Skyhorse Publishing\"/> 97% of the collection is available for loan, either on-site or through the post. It is the largest lending library in Europe.\n\nIt is a central tenet of the Library that, as books are never entirely superseded, and therefore never redundant, the collections should not be weeded of material merely because it is old, idiosyncratic or unfashionable: except in the case of occasional duplicate volumes, almost nothing has ever been discarded from the Library shelves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, New York |page=271}}</ref>\n\nThe Library also subscribes to many [[Electronic journal|ejournals]] and other [[Bibliographic database|online databases]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elibrary.londonlibrary.co.uk/|title=E-library|work=londonlibrary.co.uk}}</ref> All post-1950 acquisitions are searchable on the on-line catalogue, and pre-1950 volumes are progressively being added as part of the Retrospective Cataloguing Project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lms3.londonlibrary.co.uk/F?RN=125718857|title=The London Library online catalogue - basic search|work=londonlibrary.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n95% of the collection is housed on open shelves (the remaining 5% includes rare books held in secure storage). This open access policy \u2013 which contrasts with that in many other large libraries, including the [[British Library]] \u2013 is greatly valued by members. [[Colin Wilson]] remembered his first visit to the library in the mid 1960s: \"I have always had an obsession about books, and in this place I felt like a [[Hypersexuality|sex maniac]] in the middle of a [[harem]]\".<ref>Grindea 1978, p. 91.</ref> [[Arthur Koestler]] recorded how in 1972, commissioned to report on the [[World Chess Championship 1972|Spassky\u2013Fischer chess championship]] in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], he visited the Library to carry out some background research:\n{{quote|I hesitated for a moment whether to go to the \"C\" for chess section first, or the \"I\" for Iceland section, but chose the former, because it was nearer.

A proposal in the 1770s (when it was owned by [[William Mayne, 1st Baron Newhaven|Lord Newhaven]]) to rebuild it to a design by [[Robert Adam]] was abandoned, but it was refronted shortly afterwards. It was located in the north-west corner of the square, and had a much smaller frontage than its neighbours, being described by [[Arthur Irwin Dasent|A. I.

Another four floors of bookstacks were built to the rear. In 1920\u201322, an additional seven-storey bookstack was built further back still, again designed by Osborne Smith. (This new stack was notable for its opaque glass floors: an unforeseen drawback of the combination of glass floors and structural metal shelving was that browsers in the stacks were liable to receive periodic jolts of [[static electricity]], a problem which continues to catch new members unawares, and for which no solution has ever been found.<ref>Wells 1991, pp. 221\u20132.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Anon. |title=Corner of the Library: the 'shocking' story of one of the Library's most secluded spots |journal=London Library Magazine |volume=47 |year=2020 |pages=18\u201319 }}</ref>) In 1932\u201334 another extension was carried out to the north, incorporating a committee room (named the Prevost Room, after a major benefactor; now converted to use as a reading room), an Art Room, and five more floors of bookstacks: the architects on this occasion were the firm of [[Charles Mew\u00e8s|Mew\u00e8s]] & [[Arthur Joseph Davis|Davis]].<ref name=SoL/><ref>McIntyre 2006, pp. 11\u201319.</ref><ref>Wells 1991, pp. 159\u201366.</ref>\n\nIn February 1944, during the [[Second World War]], the northern bookstacks suffered considerable damage when the Library suffered a direct hit from a bomb: 16,000 volumes were destroyed, including most of the Biography section.

In particular, he developed an antipathy for the Keeper of Printed Books, [[Anthony Panizzi]] (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him, as the \"respectable Sub-Librarian\", in a footnote to an article published in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.<ref>Wells 1991, pp. 26\u201331.</ref> Carlyle's eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private subscription library from which books could be borrowed.\n\n[[File:Narrow London Library label.jpg|right|thumb|19th-century London Library book label]]\nThe [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]] was the Library's first President, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] its first auditor, and [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] and Sir [[Edward Bunbury]] sat on the first committee. The Belgian freedom fighter and former Louvain librarian [[Sylvain Van de Weyer]] was a vice-president from 1848 to 1874. (Van de Weyer's father-in-law [[Joshua Bates (financier)|Joshua Bates]] was a founder of the [[Boston Public Library]] in 1852.)\n\nA vigorous and long-serving presence in later Victorian times was [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton-Milnes]], later Lord Houghton, a friend of [[Florence Nightingale]]. [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] was among the founder members. In more recent times, [[Kenneth Clark]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] have been among the Library's presidents, and Sir [[Harold Nicolson]], Sir [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] and the [[Michael Langhorne Astor|Hon Michael Astor]] have been Chairmen.\n\n(Sir) [[Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright|Charles Hagberg Wright]], who served as Secretary and Librarian from 1893 to 1940, is remembered as \"the real architect of the London Library as it is today\".<ref>''[http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/aboutus/history.htm A brief history of the library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221013847/http://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/aboutus/history.htm |date=21 February 2010 }}''.

At that time, most publishers donated free copies of their books to the library. The final appeal was turned down by the [[Court of Appeal]] in 1959, and a letter in ''The Times'' of 5 November from the President and Chairman ([[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Rupert Hart-Davis]]) appealed for funds. An auction of manuscripts from many authors on 22 June 1960 raised \u00a317,000 and \u00a325,000 respectively; enough to clear debts and legal expenses of \u00a320,000. At the sale [[T. E. Lawrence]] items from his brother fetched \u00a33,800, Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]'' fetched \u00a32,800, and [[Lytton Strachey]]'s ''Queen Victoria'' \u00a31,800, though 170 inscribed books and pamphlets from [[John Masefield]] fetched only \u00a3200, which Hart-Davis thought \"shamefully low\".

The social sciences are more lightly covered. Pure and natural sciences, technology, medicine and law are not within the library's purview, although it has some books in all of those fields; books on their histories are normally acquired. [[Periodical publication|Periodicals]] and annuals on a wide range of subjects are also held in the collections. Special collections include subjects of hunting, field sports, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and of Jewish interest.<ref name=\"Skyhorse Publishing\">{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, New York}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the Library lost some 16,000 volumes to bomb damage, and in 1970 its few [[incunable|incunabula]] were sold. With those exceptions, it has (apart from some duplicates) retained all items acquired since its foundation. The Library now holds more than one million items, and each year, it acquires approximately 8,000 new books and periodicals.<ref name=\"Skyhorse Publishing\"/> 97% of the collection is available for loan, either on-site or through the post. It is the largest lending library in Europe.\n\nIt is a central tenet of the Library that, as books are never entirely superseded, and therefore never redundant, the collections should not be weeded of material merely because it is old, idiosyncratic or unfashionable: except in the case of occasional duplicate volumes, almost nothing has ever been discarded from the Library shelves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, New York |page=271}}</ref>\n\nThe Library also subscribes to many [[Electronic journal|ejournals]] and other [[Bibliographic database|online databases]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elibrary.londonlibrary.co.uk/|title=E-library|work=londonlibrary.co.uk}}</ref> All post-1950 acquisitions are searchable on the on-line catalogue, and pre-1950 volumes are progressively being added as part of the Retrospective Cataloguing Project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lms3.londonlibrary.co.uk/F?RN=125718857|title=The London Library online catalogue - basic search|work=londonlibrary.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n95% of the collection is housed on open shelves (the remaining 5% includes rare books held in secure storage). This open access policy \u2013 which contrasts with that in many other large libraries, including the [[British Library]] \u2013 is greatly valued by members. [[Colin Wilson]] remembered his first visit to the library in the mid 1960s: \"I have always had an obsession about books, and in this place I felt like a [[Hypersexuality|sex maniac]] in the middle of a [[harem]]\".<ref>Grindea 1978, p. 91.</ref> [[Arthur Koestler]] recorded how in 1972, commissioned to report on the [[World Chess Championship 1972|Spassky\u2013Fischer chess championship]] in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], he visited the Library to carry out some background research:\n{{quote|I hesitated for a moment whether to go to the \"C\" for chess section first, or the \"I\" for Iceland section, but chose the former, because it was nearer.

A proposal in the 1770s (when it was owned by [[William Mayne, 1st Baron Newhaven|Lord Newhaven]]) to rebuild it to a design by [[Robert Adam]] was abandoned, but it was refronted shortly afterwards. It was located in the north-west corner of the square, and had a much smaller frontage than its neighbours, being described by [[Arthur Irwin Dasent|A. I.

The [[facade]], overlooking St James's Square, is constructed in [[Portland stone]] in a broadly [[Jacobethan]] style, described by the [[Survey of London]] as \"curiously eclectic\".<ref name=SoL/> The main reading room is on the first floor; and above this three tall windows light three floors of bookstack. Another four floors of bookstacks were built to the rear. In 1920\u201322, an additional seven-storey bookstack was built further back still, again designed by Osborne Smith. (This new stack was notable for its opaque glass floors: an unforeseen drawback of the combination of glass floors and structural metal shelving was that browsers in the stacks were liable to receive periodic jolts of [[static electricity]], a problem which continues to catch new members unawares, and for which no solution has ever been found.<ref>Wells 1991, pp. 221\u20132.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Anon. |title=Corner of the Library: the 'shocking' story of one of the Library's most secluded spots |journal=London Library Magazine |volume=47 |year=2020 |pages=18\u201319 }}</ref>) In 1932\u201334 another extension was carried out to the north, incorporating a committee room (named the Prevost Room, after a major benefactor; now converted to use as a reading room), an Art Room, and five more floors of bookstacks: the architects on this occasion were the firm of [[Charles Mew\u00e8s|Mew\u00e8s]] & [[Arthur Joseph Davis|Davis]].<ref name=SoL/><ref>McIntyre 2006, pp. 11\u201319.</ref><ref>Wells 1991, pp. 159\u201366.</ref>\n\nIn February 1944 the northern bookstacks suffered considerable damage when the Library suffered a direct hit from a bomb: 16,000 volumes were destroyed, including most of the Biography section.

A [[mezzanine]] was inserted within the Art Room in the early 1970s; four floors of bookstack were constructed above the north bay of the reading room in 1992; and in 1995 the Anstruther Wing (named after its benefactor, [[Ian Anstruther]]) was erected at the extreme rear of the site, a nine-storey building on a small footprint designed principally to house rare books storage.<ref>McIntyre 2006, pp. 22-3.</ref>\n\n[[File:London Library back 4.JPG|thumb|right|View of the library buildings from Mason's Yard.
