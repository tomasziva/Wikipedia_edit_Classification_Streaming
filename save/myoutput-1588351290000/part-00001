An internal British Army document (released in 2007 under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]]) examining its 37 years of deployment in Northern Ireland, described the IRA as \"a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force\", while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups were described as \"little more than a collection of gangsters\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6276416.stm|title=Army paper says IRA not defeated|date=6 July 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> US media usually described the IRA as \"activists\" and \"guerillas\", while the British press widely dubbed them \"terrorists\".

The blue flag being carried at the front is that of \"Dublin Brigade IRA\".]]\n\nThe IRA was divided into a [[IRA Northern Command|Northern Command]] and a Southern Command. Northern Command operated in the nine [[Ulster]] counties as well as the [[Irish border|border]] counties of [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]] and [[County Louth|Louth]], and Southern Command operated in the remainder of Ireland. The Provisional IRA was originally commanded by a leadership based in [[Dublin]]. However, in 1977, parallel to the introduction of cell structures at the local level, command of the \"war-zone\" was given to the Northern Command. These moves at re-organisation were the idea of [[Ivor Bell]], [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Brian Keenan (Irish republican)|Brian Keenan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moloney|2002|pp=155\u2013160.}}</ref> Southern Command, located in the Republic of Ireland, consisted of a Dublin Brigade and a number of smaller units in rural areas. These were charged mainly with the importation and storage of arms for the Northern units and with raising finances through robberies and other means.<ref name=\"structure\"/>\n\n===Brigades===\nThe IRA referred to its ordinary members as volunteers (or ''\u00f3glaigh'' in Irish). Until the late 1970s, IRA volunteers were organised in units based on conventional military structures. Volunteers living in one area formed a [[Company (military unit)|company]] as part of a [[battalion]], which could be part of a [[brigade]], although many battalions were not attached to a brigade.\n\nIRA brigades usually followed [[Counties of Ireland|county]] lines, which were sometimes subdivided (especially when they included major urban areas).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/roll-of-honour|title=Roll of Honour \u2013 An Phoblacht|access-date=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217080439/http://www.anphoblacht.com/roll-of-honour|archive-date=17 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade|Belfast Brigade]] had three battalions, in the west, north and east of the city. In the early years of [[the Troubles]], the IRA in Belfast expanded rapidly; in August 1969, the Belfast Brigade had just 50 active members \u2013 by the end of 1971, it had 1,200 members, giving it a large but loosely controlled structure.<ref>{{harvnb|Moloney|2002|p=103.}}</ref>\n\nThe Derry Battalion became the [[Provisional IRA Derry Brigade|Derry Brigade]] in 1972 after a rapid increase in membership following [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] when the British Army's [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] killed 13 unarmed demonstrators at a civil rights march.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/18/newsid_4627000/4627967.stm |title=1974: Compensation for Bloody Sunday victims |work=BBC News |date= 18 December 1974|accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref> The Derry Brigade also controlled parts of northern [[County Londonderry]] and northeast [[County Donegal]].\n\nCounty Armagh had four battalions, two very active ones in South Armagh and two less active units in North Armagh. For this reason, the Armagh IRA unit is often referred to as the [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade|South Armagh Brigade]]. Tyrone, in particular, had a large IRA presence with three Brigades formed in the county, the West, Mid and East Tyrone Brigades. The [[East Tyrone Brigade]] also drew in volunteers from nearby county Monaghan. The leadership structure at battalion and company level was the same: each had its own commanding officer, quartermaster, explosives officer, and intelligence officer. There was sometimes a training officer or finance officer.\n\n===Active service units===\nFrom 1973, the IRA started to move away from the larger conventional military organisational principle owing to its security vulnerability.<ref>Hoggart, Simon ''IRA may cut middle men to reduce arrests'', The Guardian 18 August 1973</ref> A system of two parallel types of unit within an IRA brigade was introduced in place of the battalion structures. Firstly, the old \"company\" structures were used for tasks such as \"policing\" nationalist areas, intelligence-gathering, and hiding weapons. These were essential support activities. However, the bulk of actual attacks were the responsibility of the second type of unit, the [[active service unit]] (ASU). To improve security and operational capacity, these ASUs were smaller, tight-knit cells, usually consisting of five to eight members. The ASU's weapons were controlled by a brigade's [[quartermaster]].<ref name=\"structure\"/> It was estimated that in the late 1980s the IRA had roughly 300 members in ASUs and about another 450 serving in supporting roles.<ref name=\"O'Brien161\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|1999|p=161.}}</ref>\n\nThe exception to this reorganisation was the South Armagh Brigade, which retained its traditional hierarchy and battalion structure and used relatively large numbers of volunteers in its actions.<ref>{{harvnb|Moloney|2002|p=377.}}</ref> South Armagh did not have the same problems with security that other brigades had.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign 1969\u201397}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:ProvisionalIRAbadge.JPG|thumb|right|An IRA badge \u2013 the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] is frequently used to symbolise the origins of the Provisional IRA.]]\n\nIn August 1969, a confrontation between [[Catholic]] residents of the [[Bogside]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in [[Derry]] following an [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] march led to a large communal riot now referred to as the [[Battle of the Bogside]] \u2013 three days of fighting between rioters throwing stones and petrol bombs on one side, and police who saturated the area with [[CS gas]] and other [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] on the other.\n\nProtests organised by the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] in support of the Bogsiders were held elsewhere in the region, sparking retaliation by [[Protestant]] mobs; the subsequent burning, damage to property and intimidation, largely against the minority community, forced 1,800 people (1,505 of them Catholics<ref>{{harvnb|Coogan|2002|p=91.}}</ref>) from their homes in Belfast in what became known as the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]], with over 200 Catholic homes being destroyed or requiring major repairs.<ref name=\"mallie117\"/> A number of people were killed on both sides, some by the police. The [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] had been poorly armed and its defence of Catholic-majority areas from [[Ulster loyalist]]s, which had been considered one of its traditional roles since the 1920s, was seen by many as inadequate.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|1988|pp=108-112}}</ref>\n\nVeteran republicans were critical of the IRA's Dublin leadership which, for political reasons, had refused to prepare for aggressive action in advance of the violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=60.}}</ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|1988|pp=93-94}} On 24 August [[Joe Cahill]], [[Seamus Twomey]], [[D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill]], [[Billy McKee]] and several other future Provisional leaders came together in Belfast intending to remove the Belfast leadership and turn back to traditional militant republicanism.<ref name=\"mb125\">{{harvnb|Mallie|1988|p=125.}}</ref> Although the pro-[[Cathal Goulding|Goulding]] commander [[Billy McMillen]] stayed in command, he was told it was only for three months and he was not to have any communication with the IRA's Dublin based leadership.<ref name=\"mb125\"/>\n\nTraditional republicans formed the \"Provisional\" Army Council in December 1969, after an IRA convention was held at Knockvicar House in [[Boyle, County Roscommon]].<ref>''God and the Gun: The Church and Irish Terrorism'' by Martin Dillon ({{ISBN|978-0415923637}}), page 7</ref><ref>''Political Parties in the Republic of Ireland'' by Michael Gallagher ({{ISBN|978-0719017421}}), page 95</ref><ref name=\"Workers' Party' pg 145\">''The Lost Revolution \u2013 the story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'' by Brian Hanley and Scott Millar pg 145</ref> The two main issues were the acceptance of the \"National Liberation Strategy\" and a motion to end [[abstentionism]] and to recognise the British, Irish and Northern Ireland parliaments.

Opponents of this change argued strongly against the ending of abstentionism, and when the vote took place, [[Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in]], present as IRA Director of Intelligence, announced that he no longer considered that the IRA leadership represented republican goals.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|1988|p=136.}}</ref> However, there was no walkout.

This activity culminated in the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]], when seven IRA and three [[Irish National Liberation Army]] members starved themselves to death in pursuit of political status. The hunger strike leader [[Bobby Sands]] and [[Anti H-Block]] activist [[Owen Carron]] were elected to the [[British Parliament]], and two other protesting prisoners were elected to the [[D\u00e1il]]. In addition, there were work stoppages and large demonstrations all over Ireland in sympathy with the hunger strikers.

After the ceasefire was reinstated in July 1997, Sinn F\u00e9in was admitted into all-party talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.

Civilian informers were regarded as [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] and were usually either killed or exiled. The IRA killed 59 alleged informers, about half of them IRA members and half of them Catholic civilians. The bodies of alleged informers were usually left in public as a warning to others.

The IRA considers these groups to be all part of the same apparatus. As noted above, the IRA seeks to draw a direct descendancy from the original IRA and those who engaged in the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The IRA sees the previous conflict as a [[guerrilla war]] which accomplished some of its aims, with some remaining \"unfinished business\".<ref>Gerry Adam's 2006 Easter Message was that \"unfinished business\" remains, available here [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/sf/ga160406.htm]. \"But in truth The Proclamation is also unfinished business.

Northern Command operated in the nine [[Ulster]] counties as well as the [[Irish border|border]] counties of [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]] and [[County Louth|Louth]], and Southern Command operated in the remainder of Ireland. The Provisional IRA was originally commanded by a leadership based in [[Dublin]]. However, in 1977, parallel to the introduction of cell structures at the local level, command of the \"war-zone\" was given to the Northern Command. These moves at re-organisation were the idea of [[Ivor Bell]], [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Brian Keenan (Irish republican)|Brian Keenan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moloney|2002|pp=155\u2013160.}}</ref> Southern Command, located in the Republic of Ireland, consisted of a Dublin Brigade and a number of smaller units in rural areas.

Until the late 1970s, IRA volunteers were organised in units based on conventional military structures. Volunteers living in one area formed a [[Company (military unit)|company]] as part of a [[battalion]], which could be part of a [[brigade]], although many battalions were not attached to a brigade.\n\nIRA brigades usually followed [[Counties of Ireland|county]] lines, which were sometimes subdivided (especially when they included major urban areas).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/roll-of-honour|title=Roll of Honour \u2013 An Phoblacht|access-date=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217080439/http://www.anphoblacht.com/roll-of-honour|archive-date=17 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade|Belfast Brigade]] had three battalions, in the west, north and east of the city.

For this reason, the Armagh IRA unit is often referred to as the [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade|South Armagh Brigade]]. Tyrone, in particular, had a large IRA presence with three Brigades formed in the county, the West, Mid and East Tyrone Brigades. The [[East Tyrone Brigade]] also drew in volunteers from nearby county Monaghan. The leadership structure at battalion and company level was the same: each had its own commanding officer, quartermaster, explosives officer, and intelligence officer. There was sometimes a training officer or finance officer.\n\n===Active service units===\nFrom 1973, the IRA started to move away from the larger conventional military organisational principle owing to its security vulnerability.<ref>Hoggart, Simon ''IRA may cut middle men to reduce arrests'', The Guardian 18 August 1973</ref> A system of two parallel types of unit within an IRA brigade was introduced in place of the battalion structures. Firstly, the old \"company\" structures were used for tasks such as \"policing\" nationalist areas, intelligence-gathering, and hiding weapons. These were essential support activities. However, the bulk of actual attacks were the responsibility of the second type of unit, the [[active service unit]] (ASU). To improve security and operational capacity, these ASUs were smaller, tight-knit cells, usually consisting of five to eight members. The ASU's weapons were controlled by a brigade's [[quartermaster]].<ref name=\"structure\"/> It was estimated that in the late 1980s the IRA had roughly 300 members in ASUs and about another 450 serving in supporting roles.<ref name=\"O'Brien161\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|1999|p=161.}}</ref>\n\nThe exception to this reorganisation was the South Armagh Brigade, which retained its traditional hierarchy and battalion structure and used relatively large numbers of volunteers in its actions.<ref>{{harvnb|Moloney|2002|p=377.}}</ref> South Armagh did not have the same problems with security that other brigades had.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign 1969\u201397}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:ProvisionalIRAbadge.JPG|thumb|right|An IRA badge \u2013 the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] is frequently used to symbolise the origins of the Provisional IRA.]]\n\nIn August 1969, a confrontation between [[Catholic]] residents of the [[Bogside]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in [[Derry]] following an [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] march led to a large communal riot now referred to as the [[Battle of the Bogside]] \u2013 three days of fighting between rioters throwing stones and petrol bombs on one side, and police who saturated the area with [[CS gas]] and other [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] on the other.\n\nProtests organised by the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] in support of the Bogsiders were held elsewhere in the region, sparking retaliation by [[Protestant]] mobs; the subsequent burning, damage to property and intimidation, largely against the minority community, forced 1,800 people (1,505 of them Catholics<ref>{{harvnb|Coogan|2002|p=91.}}</ref>) from their homes in Belfast in what became known as the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]], with over 200 Catholic homes being destroyed or requiring major repairs.<ref name=\"mallie117\"/> A number of people were killed on both sides, some by the police.

This activity culminated in the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]], when seven IRA and three [[Irish National Liberation Army]] members starved themselves to death in pursuit of political status. The hunger strike leader [[Bobby Sands]] and [[Anti H-Block]] activist [[Owen Carron]] were elected to the [[British Parliament]], and two other protesting prisoners were elected to the [[D\u00e1il]].

The IRA gained much of its support from these activities, as they were widely perceived within the nationalist community as being defenders of [[Irish nationalist]] and Roman Catholic people against aggression.<ref>{{harvnb|English|2003|pp=134\u2013135.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Grand-Hotel-Following-Bomb-Attack-1984-10-12.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Brighton hotel bombing]]]]\n\nFrom 1971 to 1994, the IRA launched a sustained offensive armed campaign that mainly targeted the British Army, the RUC, the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) and economic targets in Northern Ireland.<!--The first half of the 1970s was the most intense period of the IRA campaign.---> In addition, some IRA members carried out attacks against Protestant civilians.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13857495 Kingsmills families demand full inquiry into massacre] [[BBC News]] 21 June 2011</ref>\n\nThe IRA was chiefly active in Northern Ireland, although it took its campaign to England and mainland Europe. The IRA also targeted certain British government officials, politicians, judges, establishment figures, British Army and police officers in England, and in other areas such as the Republic of Ireland, West Germany, and the Netherlands. By the early 1990s, the bulk of the IRA activity was carried out by the South Armagh Brigade,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} well known through its [[South Armagh Sniper (1990-1997)|sniping operations]] and attacks on British Army helicopters. The bombing campaign principally targeted political, economic and military targets, and approximately 60 civilians were killed by the IRA in England during the conflict.<ref>{{cite web| title = Crosstabulations (two-way tables) | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/crosstabs.html |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] | accessdate =17 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that this bombing campaign helped convince the British government (who had hoped to contain the conflict to Northern Ireland with its [[Ulsterisation]] policy) to negotiate with Sinn F\u00e9in after the IRA ceasefires of August 1994 and July 1997.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=378.}}</ref><ref>Maillot Agn\u00e8s (2005).

Seven IRA mortar attacks resulted in fatalities or serious injuries. The IRA's development of mortar tactics was a response to the heavy fortifications on RUC and British Army bases. Mortars were useful to the IRA as they could hit targets at short range, which could lead to effective attacks in built-up urban areas. The mortars used by the IRA were often self-made and developed by the Engineering Department of the Army General Headquarters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Gary.

The IRA considers these groups to be all part of the same apparatus. As noted above, the IRA seeks to draw a direct descendancy from the original IRA and those who engaged in the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The IRA sees the previous conflict as a [[guerrilla war]] which accomplished some of its aims, with some remaining \"unfinished business\".<ref>Gerry Adam's 2006 Easter Message was that \"unfinished business\" remains, available here [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/sf/ga160406.htm]. \"But in truth The Proclamation is also unfinished business. It is unfinished business which the vast majority of the Irish people want to see brought to completion.\"</ref>\n\nA process called \"Criminalisation\" was begun in the mid-1970s as part of a British strategy of \"Criminalisation, Ulsterisation, and Normalisation\". The policy was outlined in a 1975 British strategy paper titled \"The Way Ahead\", which was not published but was referred to by Labour's first Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, and came to be the dominant British political theme in the conflict as it raged into the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAnother categorisation avoids the terms \"guerrilla\" or \"terrorist\" but does view the conflict in military terms. The phrase originated with the British military strategist [[Frank Kitson]] who was active in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s. In Kitson's view, the violence of the IRA represented an \"insurrection\", with the enveloping atmosphere of belligerence representing a \"[[low intensity conflict]]\" \u2013 a conflict where the forces involved in fighting operate at a greatly reduced tempo, with fewer combatants, at a reduced range of tactical equipment and limited scope to operate in a military manner.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nThe IRA is a proscribed organisation in the United Kingdom under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]]<ref name=\"Proscribed\">{{cite act |title=[[Terrorism Act 2000]] |number=11 |year=2000 |article=2 |articletype=Schedule |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/2}}</ref> and an unlawful organisation in the Republic of Ireland under the Offences Against the State Acts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/sro/162/made/en/print|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute|last=Book (eISB)|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie}}</ref> Membership of the IRA remains illegal in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but IRA prisoners convicted of offences committed before 1998 have been granted conditional early release as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].<ref>[http://centreforforeignpolicystudies.dal.ca/pdf/gradsymp11/Vocisano.pdf Transitional Justice in Northern Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318152022/http://centreforforeignpolicystudies.dal.ca/pdf/gradsymp11/Vocisano.pdf|date=18 March 2014}} Submitted for the 6th Annual Dalhousie University Graduate Symposium, 10 and 11 March 2011 in Halifax, Nova Scotia</ref> In the United Kingdom a person convicted of membership of a \"proscribed organisation\", such as the IRA, still nominally faces imprisonment for up to 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo021030/debtext/21030-08.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 30&nbsp;October&nbsp;2002 (pt 8)|date=30 October 2002|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=17 March 2007}}</ref> The [[US Department of State]] has not designated the IRA as a [[United States Department of State list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organization]], but lists them in the category 'other selected terrorist groups also deemed of relevance in the global war on terrorism'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Real IRA designated terrorists|author=Toby Harnden|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1330611/Real-IRA-designated-terrorists.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 May 2001|access-date=3 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/45323.pdf|title=U.S. Department of Homeland Security \u2013 Terrorist Organization Reference Guide January 2004, p119}}</ref>\n\n[[Harold Wilson]]'s secret 1971 meeting with IRA leaders with the help of [[John O'Connell (Dublin politician)|John O'Connell]] angered the Irish government; [[Garret FitzGerald]] wrote 30 years later that \"the strength of the feelings of our democratic leaders ... was not, however, publicly ventilated at the time\" because Wilson was a former and possible future British prime minister.<ref name=\"fitzgerald2006\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf | title=The 1974\u20135 Threat of a British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland | author=FitzGerald, Garrett | journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs | year=2006 | volume=17 | pages=141\u2013150 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926091138/http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf | archivedate=26 September 2007| doi=10.3318/ISIA.2006.17.1.141 }}</ref> Members of the IRA are tried in the Republic of Ireland in the [[Special Criminal Court]].
