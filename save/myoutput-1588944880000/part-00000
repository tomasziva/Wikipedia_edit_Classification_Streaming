[[State school|Public schools]] and [[private school]]s have both been present. Modern reforms to education began in the late 19th century. Since its early history, Korean education has been influenced significantly by Confucian values particularly in its emphasis of formal learning and scholarship through China more than fifteen centuries ago. Confucianism instilled facilities like governance of men by merit, social mobility through education, and the civil examination system based on the system that was developed in China during the Tang Dynasty. As a result, written word and mastery of Chinese classics and literacy became the primary method in choosing individuals for bureaucratic positions, gaining them a respective social status and privileges.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Education Fever: Society, Politics, And The Pursuit of Schooling in South Korea|last=Seth|first=Michael J.|publisher=Hawai'i Studies on Korea|year=2002|isbn=0-8248-2534-9|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe Chosun period was significant in shaping the dynamics and foundation of the Korean education system in that it established schools that ingrained loyalty, orthodoxy, and motivation for official recruitment into its students. The primary means to receive an education during the Chosun period were through village schools (sodang; sojae) and through private tutoring. The sodang was the most common method of formal education in Korea until the late twentieth century, and was usually available only to a handful of neighborhood boys starting at around age seven. In the middle of the sixteenth century, however, the role of official schools gradually declined with the emergence of private academies (sowon), which usually functioned as rural retreats and centers of learning until the majority of them were closed in the 1870s in an effort to centralize authority.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPreparing students for competitive examinations were pronounced during the Chosun era as a means of social mobility and selection of official positions, and remained a basic tenet in Korean education throughout its history. However, this extreme emphasis on education and meritocracy was contrasted by hereditary aristocracy during the Chosun period, where bloodlines and kinship were particularly pronounced. Due to Confucian influences, however, education was able to maintain a fairly equalizing presence over society because of its belief in each individual being capable of benefitting from formal education and achieving enlightenment. Education was also dominated by the exalted scholar-teacher relationship, where teachers held almost a sacred status and were seen as a principal source of ethical counsel. This convention also engendered the tradition of ''remonstrance'', which obligated the scholar to criticize the actions of the government and even the king in order to avoid threatening the Confucian-inspired concept of the moral order of the universe.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe dynastic period did not prioritize special or technical training, and thus a preference for a non-specialized and literary education has remained in Korea. Many of these developments were pronounced towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century when the Chosun dynasty began implementing a Western-style education system as a result of the intrusion of foreign powers into Korea. By 1904, public education was largely confined to Seoul, which was generally resisted by the public as well as government officials. This maintained the dominance of sodang and other traditional institutions as the primary means to receive a formal education. However, as a result of financial support from members of the royal family and American missionary activities and schools, the number of schools began to increase in the early 1900s. As a means to promote basic literacy among its citizens, Korea also introduced mixed script of Hangeul and Chinese characters into its instruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation (1905-1945), Korea was able to establish a comprehensive and modern system of national education through centralization and deliberate planning of integrating Japanese occupational professionalism and values. However, there were severe restrictions like the lack of access to education beyond the elementary level for Koreans and the manipulation of education to indoctrinate Korean subjects to be loyal to the Japanese empire, which led to turmoil and discontent among Koreans who were forced to assimilate. The Japanese emphasized low-level and non-professional track schooling for Koreans which was pronounced by the Educational Ordinance of 1911, where Japanese residents had fourteen years of schooling available while Koreans only had eight years available to them, unless they were civil servants wherein eleven was the maximum. Schooling was primarily based on Japanese values, literacy, and history as an attempt to make young Koreans loyal to the Japanese state and indirectly wipe out Korean culture and history. As a minor development, the Educational Ordinance of 1922 was enacted, which reopened the Seoul Teachers' School, extended elementary and secondary education, and added college preparatory or advanced technical training to the curriculum.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHigher education became a central issue for upper-class and upwardly mobile Koreans, who were provided very limited access to these institutions as well as positions of administration and teaching. Furthermore, with the introduction of the Educational Ordinance of 1938, Korean schools were to be identical to Japanese ones in organization and curriculum, which made education a highly militarized and regimented tool for forced assimilation and militarization.<ref name=\":0\" /> These last few years of Japanese rule pronounced the discontent of Koreans whose social and political climates had been deeply affected.\n\n===Post-war years===\nAfter [[Gwangbokjeol]] and the liberation from Japan, the Korean government began to study and discuss for a new [[philosophy of education]]. The new educational philosophy was created under the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]](USAMGIK) with a focus on [[democratic education]]. The new system attempted to make education available to all students equally and promote the educational administration to be more self-governing. It also emphasized a decentralized education which local and community control in order to maintain educational autonomy from authoritarian policies. Specific policies included: re-educating [[teacher]]s, lowering [[functional illiteracy]] by educating adults, restoration of the [[Korean language]] for [[technical terminology]], and expansion of various educational institutions.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web |url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0005524 |script-title=ko:?? |publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |work=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |accessdate=January 22, 2014 |language=Korean |trans-title=Education}}</ref> This system did not instigate radical change, however, to the extent that it maintained the centralized and authoritarian administration created by the Japanese with no meaningful changes. It did, however, abet in the Koreanization of South Korean education through the initiative of Korean leaders by promoting Hangeul, removing Japanese instruction practices, and emphasizing Korean history, geography, and literature. Aside from these developments, the most striking feature of the U.S. military occupation was the significant expansion of schooling and the student population.\n\nFollowing the [[Korean War]], the government of Syngman Rhee reversed many of these reforms after 1948, when only primary schools remained in most cases coeducational and, because of a lack of resources, education was compulsory only up to the sixth grade. In 1948, the prevalent debate in South Korean education was whether to maintain an elitist multitrack path based on the prewar Japanese colonial model, or adopt an open American system that avoided early tracking and did not terminalize primary or secondary education.\n\nDuring the years when Rhee and [[Park Chung Hee]] were in power, the control of education was gradually taken out of the hands of local school boards and concentrated in a centralized Ministry of Education. In the late 1980s, the ministry was responsible for administration of schools, allocation of resources, setting of enrollment quotas, certification of schools and teachers, curriculum development (including the issuance of textbook guidelines), and other basic policy decisions. Provincial and special city boards of education still existed. Although each board was composed of seven members who were supposed to be selected by popularly elected legislative bodies, this arrangement ceased to function after 1973. Subsequently, school board members were approved by the minister of education. In high school they would call it year one grade (9th grader) and year 2 would be (10th grader) and so on. Therefore, a multitrack and single secondary school system prevailed, largely due to the fact that administrators did not want to divide institutions, and parents were not receptive to the idea of two entrance exams''.'' The outcome the 1950 MOE proposal for a uniform system was a 6-4-3-4 academic schedule, which entailed 6 years of primary school, 4 years of middle school, 3 years of vocational or academic high school, and 4 years of college or university. A complex system of technical and vocational training was also added to educational policy, where children were able to decide on an academic versus a vocational route early on in their academic career. Many opposers of this policy actually viewed it as positive because they believed that the academic route would seem more prolific and parents and students would be willing to pursue it more than the vocational route. Furthermore, even though a few local school boards were established toward the late 1940s, they were not appreciated by many Koreans because there was a widespread notion that a uniform and centrally controlled system is best. A rigorous and uniform national curriculum was established in the mid-1950s and there were significant efforts to make school accessible for everyone, especially in the context of Rhee's declaration of compulsory universal literacy and basic education. While universal basic education eliminated disparities between classes, competition became very fierce due to restricted entry into higher academic tiers, which contributed to the predominant \"education fever\" that is still prevalent in South Korea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, there was a difficulty in harnessing the demand for education towards the needs of an industrializing economy, which caused a growth in private foundations in order to supply the public demand for schooling. Furthermore, the 60s and 70s were characterized by a large demand to direct educational development to economic development, which necessitated a greater emphasis on vocational and technical training rather than academic training in order to help citizens gain skills that would supply the country's economic needs. Even though there were major criticisms on behalf of the public for this emphasis on vocational training due to a clashing with Confucian values, the state continued to strengthen vocational education, especially after the shift in industrialization to heavy chemical and machine industries in the 70s. The 1960s and 70s experienced turmoil in education systems due to public resistance and the uncooperativeness of private schools with the state as they attempted to supply public demand. While the state was able to fulfill many of its economic goals, it came at a great social and political cost like the depopulation of rural areas and President Park's assassination <ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nMost observers agree that South Korea's spectacular progress in modernization and economic growth since the [[Korean War]] is largely attributable to the willingness of individuals to invest a large amount of resources in education: the improvement of \"human capital.\" The traditional esteem for the educated man, now extends to scientists, technicians, and others working with specialized knowledge. Highly educated technocrats and economic planners could claim much of the credit for their country's economic successes since the 1960s. Scientific professions were generally regarded as the most prestigious by South Koreans in the 1980s.\n\nStatistics demonstrate the success of South Korea's national education programs. In 1945 the adult literacy rate was estimated at 22 percent; by 1970 adult literacy was 87.6 percent<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\">Andrea Matles Savada and William Shaw, editors. ''South Korea: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.</ref> and, by the late 1980s, sources estimated it at around 93 percent.<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> Although only primary school (grades one through six) was compulsory, percentages of age-groups of children and young people enrolled in secondary level schools were equivalent to those found in industrialized countries, including Japan. Approximately 4.8 million students in the eligible age-group were attending primary school in 1985. The percentage of students going on to optional middle school the same year was more than 99 percent. Approximately 34 percent, one of the world's highest rates of secondary-school graduates attended institutions of higher education in 1987, a rate similar to Japan's (about 30 percent) and exceeding Britain's (20 percent).\n\nGovernment expenditure on education has been generous. In 1975, it was 220 billion [[South Korean won|won]],<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> the equivalent of 2.2 percent of the gross national product, or 13.9 percent of total government expenditure. By 1986, education expenditure had reached 3.76 trillion [[South Korean won|won]], or 4.5 percent of the GNP, and 27.3 percent of government budget allocations.\n\nThe 1980s and 90s marked an era of democratization and economic prosperity in South Korea, partly due to the \"education fever\". In 1991, for the first time in thirty years, the country elected provincial and city councils in order to localize education, and leaders like Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung were able to enact major overhauls to the education system in order to accommodate democratization through methods like abolishing on-campus ROTCS training and political mobilization of students, legalization of teacher unions, and removing anti-Communist texts<ref name=\":0\" />. The MOE began to shift away from a uniform curriculum by allowing school boards to implement some minor variations in instructional content. Literacy became virtually universal in South Korea while it rose up in international ranks in math and science, especially. \n\nDespite South Korea's transition to democracy, traditional and Confucian values remained very strong. Overall, the huge strides in educational development came at the cost of intense pressure among students, high suicide rates, and family financial struggles through investment in schooling and private tutoring. \n\n===Student activism===\nStudent activism has a long and honorable history in Korea. Students in [[Joseon]] secondary schools often became involved in the intense factional struggles of the scholar-official class. Students played a major role in Korea's independence movement, particularly in March 1, 1919, which was a protest based on students' growing resentment towards restrictive, discriminatory, and hostile Japanese occupation and instruction practices. Students were also heavily involved in repeated national efforts and demonstrations against Japanese policies, with instances like the Gwangju Student Movement in 1929 and the June 10, 1926 funeral line protest. \n\nStudents protested against the regimes of [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Observers noted, however, that while student activists in the past generally embraced liberal and democratic values, the new generation of militants in the 1980s were far more radical. Most participants adopted some version of the [[minjung]] ideology but was also animated by strong feelings of popular [[nationalism]] and [[xenophobia]].\n\nOne of the most extreme and landmark movements was the Kwangju Massacre in 1980, where students were driven by a strong will to rebel through Marxist influences against the martial law government. This radicalism was paralleled by the communist sympathizing and radicalism of students in the 1940s and 50s as a result of American occupation.\n\nThe most militant university students, perhaps about 5 percent of the total enrollment at [[Seoul National University]] and comparable figures at other institutions in the [[Seoul|capital]] during the late 1980s, were organized into small circles or cells rarely containing more than fifty members. Police estimated that there were 72 such organizations of varying orientation, having the change of curriculum and education system of South Korea people have been enriched in an imaginary way that makes them propel in all their studies.\n\n===Reforms in the 1980s===\nFollowing the assumption of power by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] in 1980, the Ministry of Education implemented a number of reforms designed to make the system more fair and to increase higher education opportunities for the population at large. In a very popular move, the ministry dramatically increased enrollment at large.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nSocial emphasis on education was not without its problems, as it tended to accentuate class differences. In the late 1980s, a college degree was considered necessary for entering the middle class; there were no alternative pathways of social advancement, with the possible exception of a military career, outside higher education. People without a college education, including skilled workers with vocational school backgrounds, often were treated as second-class citizens by their white-collar, college-educated managers, despite the importance of their skills for economic development. Intense competition for places at the most prestigious universities\u2014the sole gateway into elite circles\u2014promoted, like the old Confucian system, a sterile emphasis on rote memorization in order to pass secondary school and college entrance examinations. Particularly after a dramatic expansion of college enrollments in the early 1980s, South Korea faced the problem of what to do about a large number of young people staying in school for a long time, usually at great sacrifice to themselves and their families, and then faced with limited job opportunities because their skills were not marketable.\n\n===Great recession===\nWith a slowing economy, a rigid and fast-changing job market as a result of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] and the demise of the [[Industrial Age]], many young South Korean high school graduates are now realizing that high entrance examination and test scores for the promise of future career success did not carry the same weight as it once did.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/asia/07pride.html |title=With Wounded Pride, Unemployed Koreans Quietly Turn to Manual Labor |last=FACKLER |first=MARTIN  |date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> In 2013, 43,000 South Koreans in their twenties, and 21,000 in their thirties lost their jobs.<ref name=ICEF>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2014/01/high-performance-high-pressure-in-south-koreas-education-system/ |title=High performance, high pressure in South Korea's education system |publisher=ICEF Monitor |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> According to a 2013 survey conducted by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, nearly four out of every 10 young workers in their 20s and 30s said they were overeducated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |title=Fighting for Equity in Education |date=November 24, 2013 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118102555/http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |archive-date=November 18, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Stratfor\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/south-korea-votes-changing-region |title=South Korea Votes in a Changing Region |date=April 13, 2016 |publisher=Stratfor}}</ref> In 2013, fewer young South Koreans chose go on to university after finishing high school as the unemployment rate for university graduates continues to soar, falling income for college graduates continues to decline and the value of a college degree has now becoming increasingly in doubt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/09/07/2013090700379.html |title=Fewer Young People Go On to University |publisher=The Chosun |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> Educational reforms initiated by the South Korean government have become more dynamic and that university is no longer the only guarantee of a career.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/revamped-vocational-education-may-have-prevented-graduate-glut-ex-korean-minister?page=1 | title=Earlier introduction of vocational education 'could have prevented' S Korea's grad glut | publisher=Today | date=24 July 2015 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Ng Jing Yng}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/404739/1 | title=Meister of job placement | publisher=The Dong-A-Ilbo | date=22 September 2012 | accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref> Government measures have also been prompted to encourage young unemployed college graduates to look at other employment possibilities such as starting a business or seeking employment opportunities at smaller and medium size businesses.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\">{{cite web | url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20091116000035 | title=Lee urges job seekers to look for opportunities at smaller companies | publisher=The Korea Herald | date=30 March 2010 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> Former President [[Lee Myung-Bak]] urged young unemployed job seekers to start looking at other employment possibilities with small and medium-sized businesses beyond large conglomerates.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/09/01/2016090101665.html | title=Young Jobseekers Must Look Beyond Big Business | publisher=The Chosun llbo | date=1 September 2016 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn oversaturated and overqualified labor market has resulted in shortages of skilled blue-collar labor and a lack of qualified vocational employees for small and medium-sized businesses, young South Koreans now realize that a college degree no longer guarantees a job as it once did.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\"/> With the nation's high university entrance rate, South Korea has produced an overeducated and underemployed labor force with many being unable find employment at the level of their education qualifications.

Many students in Korea start kindergarten at the Western age of three and will, therefore, continue to study in kindergarten for three or four years, before starting their 'formal education' in 'grade one' of primary school. Many private kindergartens offer their classes in English to give students a 'head-start' in the mandatory English education they would receive later in public school. Kindergartens often pay homage to the expectations of parents with impressive courses, graduation ceremonies, complete with diplomas and gowns. Korean kindergartens are expected to start teaching basic maths, reading and writing to children, including education on how to count, add, subtract, and read and write in Korean, and often in English and Chinese. Children in Korean kindergartens are also taught using games focused on education and coordination, such as \"playing doctor\" to teach body parts, food and nutrition, and work positions for adults. Songs, dances, and memorization are a big part of Korean kindergarten education.\n\n==Primary education==\n[[Elementary schools]] ({{lang-ko|\ucd08\ub4f1 \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''chodeung hakgyo'') consists of grades [[First grade|one]] to [[sixth grade|six]] (age 8 to age 13 in [[East Asian age reckoning|Korean years]]\u20147 to 12 in western years). The South Korean government changed its name to the current form from ''Citizens' school'' ({{lang-ko|\uad6d\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''Gukmin hakgyo'') in 1996. The former name was shortened from \ud669\uad6d \uc2e0\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ??????

About 98% of Korean students finish secondary education.<ref name=\"abc.es\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/20121020/familia-educacion/abci-escalado-educacion-corea-podio-201210161058.html |title=As\u00ed ha escalado la educaci\u00f3n de Corea del Sur al podio mundial |language=Spanish |first=M. |last=Arrizabalaga |work=ABC.es}}</ref> The secondary-school enrollment figure also reflected changing population trends\u2014there were 3,959,975 students in secondary schools in 1979. Given the importance of entry into higher education, the majority of students attended general or academic high schools in 1987: 1,397,359 students, or 60 percent of the total, attended general or academic high schools, as compared with 840,265 students in vocational secondary schools. Vocational schools specialized in a number of fields: primarily agriculture, fishery, commerce, trades, merchant marine, engineering, and the arts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nCompetitive entrance examinations at the middle-school level were abolished in 1968. Although as of the late 1980s, students still had to pass noncompetitive qualifying examinations, they were assigned to secondary institutions by lottery, or else by location within the boundary of the school district. Secondary schools, formerly ranked according to the quality of their students, have been equalized, with a portion of good, mediocre, and poor students being assigned to each one. The reform, however, did not equalize secondary schools completely. In Seoul, students who performed well in qualifying examinations were allowed to attend better quality schools in a \"common\" district, while other students attended schools in one of five geographical districts. The reforms applied equally to public and private schools whose enrollments were strictly controlled by the Ministry of Education.\n\nIn South Korea, the grade of a student is reset as the student progresses through elementary, middle and high school. To differentiate the grades between students, one would often state the grade based on the level of education he/she is in. For example, a student in the first year of middle school would be referred to as \"First grade in Middle School (\uc911\ud559\uad50 1\ud559\ub144.)\".\n\nMiddle schools are called ''Jung hakgyo'' (\uc911\ud559\uad50) in Korean, which literally means ''middle school''. High schools are called ''Godeung hakgyo'' (\uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50) in Korean, literally meaning \"high school\".\n\n===Middle school===\n[[Middle schools]] in South Korea consist of three grades. Most students enter at age 12 or 13 and graduate at age 15 or 16. These three grades correspond roughly to grades 7\u20139 in the North American system and Years 8\u201311 in the [[Education in England|English]] and [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] system.\n\nMiddle school in South Korea marks a considerable shift from primary school, with students expected to take their studies much more seriously. At most middle schools, regulation uniforms and haircuts are enforced fairly strictly, and some aspects of students' lives are highly controlled. Like in primary school, students spend most of the day in the same homeroom classroom with the same classmates; however, students have different teachers for each subject. Teachers move around from classroom to classroom, and few teachers apart from those who teach special subjects have their own rooms to which students come. Homeroom teachers (\ub2f4\uc784 \uad50\uc0ac, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''damim gyosa'') play a very important role in students' lives.\n\nMost middle school students take seven lessons a day, and in addition to this usually have an early morning block that precedes regular lessons and an eighth lesson specializing in an extra subject to finish the day. Unlike high school, middle school curricula do not vary much from school to school. Korean, Algebra, Geometry, English, social studies, and science form the core subjects, with students also receiving instruction in [[music]], [[art]], PE, [[korean history]], [[ethics]], [[home economics]], secondary language, technology, and [[Hanja]]. Which subjects students study and to what extent may change from year to year. All regular lessons are 45 minutes long. Before school, students have an extra block of 30 minutes or longer that may be used for self-study, watching Educational Broadcast System (EBS) broadcasts, or for personal or class administration. Beginning in 2008, students attended school Monday through Friday, and had a half-day every 1st, 3rd, and 5th (calendar permitting) Saturday of the month. Saturday lessons usually included Club Activity (CA) lessons, where students could participate in extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, many schools have regular classes without extracurricular activities because schools and parents want students to study more. Despite this, from 2012 onwards, primary and secondary schools, including middle schools, will no longer hold Saturday classes. To this day, many schools still hold Saturday classes illegally because the parents want their children to go to school and study.<ref name=\"Thomaswhite.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thomaswhite.com/world-markets/south-korea-an-end-to-saturday-classes/ |title=South Korea: An end to Saturday classes &#124; Thomas White International |publisher=Thomaswhite.com |date=2011-09-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the government abolished entrance examinations for middle school students, replacing it with a system whereby primary school students within the same district are selected for middle schools by a lottery system. This has the effect of equalizing the quality of students from school to school, though schools in areas where students come from more privileged backgrounds still tend to outperform schools in poorer areas. Until recently, most middle schools have been same-sex, though in the past decade most new middle schools have been coed, and some previously same-sex schools have converted to coed as well. Some schools have converted to same-sex due to pressure from parents who thought that their children would study better in [[single-sex education]].\n\nAs with primary schools, students pass from grade to grade regardless of knowledge or academic achievement, the result being that classes often have students of vastly different abilities learning the same subject material together. In the final year of middle school examination scores become very important for top students hoping to gain entrance into top high schools, and for those in the middle hoping to get into an academic rather than a technical or vocational high school. Otherwise, examinations and marks only matter insofar as living up to a self-enforced concept of position in the school ranking system. There are some standardized examinations for certain subjects, and teachers of academic subjects are expected to follow approved textbooks, but generally middle school teachers have more flexibility over curricula and methods than teachers in high school.\n\nMore than 95% of middle school students also attend independently owned, after-school tutoring agencies known as \u201chagwon,\u201d or \"cram schools,\u201d in order to receive extra instruction from private tutors. The core subjects, especially the cumulative subjects of Korean, English, and math, receive the most emphasis. Some \u201dhagwon\u201d specialize in just one subject, while others offer all core subjects, constituting a second round of schooling every day for their pupils. Indeed, some parents place more stress on their children's \u201dhagwon\u201d studies than their public school studies. Additionally, many students attend academies for things such as martial arts or music. Thus, many middle school students, like their high school counterparts, return from a day of schooling well after sunset. The average South Korean family spends 20% percent of its income on after-hours cram schools, more spending per capita on private tutoring than any other country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education-jan-june11-koreaschools_01-21/ | title=In Hypercompetitive South Korea, Pressures Mount on Young Pupils | publisher=PBS | date=21 January 2011 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bd4a52a-3b06-11e3-a7ec-00144feab7de | title=Education in South Korea: system must change to satisfy country's and pupils' needs | publisher=Financial Times | date=5 November 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Song Jung-a}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20051653/seeing-the-shared-traits.html | title=Seeing the shared traits | publisher=The Slovak Spectator | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=On My Own: Korean Businesses and Race Relations in America | publisher=University of Chicago Press. | author=In-Jin Yoon | year=1997 | page=78}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/news/News_View.asp?nseq=146856 | title=Korean parents spending most of income on children's education | publisher=Arirang News | date=7 May 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===High school===\n[[High school]]s in South Korea teach students for three years, from first grade (age 15\u201317) to third grade (age 17\u201319), and students commonly graduate at age 18 or 19. High school students are commonly expected to study increasingly long hours each year moving toward graduation, to become competitive and enter extremely attractive universities in Korea. Many high school students wake and leave home in the morning at 5{{nbsp}}am. When the school is over at 4 pm, they go to a studying room in the school or to a library to study instead of going home. This is called \u201cyaja,\u201d which literally means \u201cevening self-study.\u201d They don't need to go home to eat dinner since most schools provide paid dinner for students. After finishing yaja (which usually ends at 11:00 pm, but later than 12:00 am at some schools), they return home after studying, then return to specialty study schools (which are called [[Hagwon]]) often until 3{{nbsp}}am, from Monday to Friday. In addition, they often study on weekends.\n\nThe yaja had not been truly \u201cself\u201d study for more than 30 years; all high school students were forced to do it. From the 2010s, the Ministry of Education has encouraged high schools to free students of yaja and to allow them to do it whenever they want. Many standard public high schools near Seoul are now no longer forcing students do it. But private high schools, special-purpose high schools (such as science high schools and foreign language high schools), or normal schools far from Seoul are still forcing students to do yaja.\n\nA common saying in Korea is: \u201cIf you sleep three hours each night, you may get into a top 'SKY university\u2019(Seoul National University, Korea University, and/or Yonsei University). If you sleep four hours each night, you may get into another university. If you sleep five or more hours each night, especially in your last year of high school, forget about getting into any university.\u201d Accordingly, many high school students in their final year do not have any free time for holidays, birthdays or vacations before the CSATs (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korean: \uc218\ub2a5, [[College Scholastic Ability Test|Suneung]]), which are university entrance exams held by the Ministry of Education. Surprisingly, some high school students are offered chances to travel with family to enjoy fun and relaxing vacations, but these offers are often refused on the first suggestion by the students themselves, and increasingly on later additional trips if any, due to peer influences and a fear of \u201cfalling behind\u201d in classes. Many high school students seem to prefer staying with friends and studying, rather than taking a break. \u201cSkipping classes\u201d for fun is extremely rare in Korea. Rebellious students will often stay in class and use smartphones connected to the internet to chat with friends behind the teacher's back during classes.\n\nHigh schools in Korea can be divided into specialty tracks that accord with a student's interest and career path or a normal state high school. For special high schools, there are science ([[Seoul Science High School|Science high school]]), foreign language, international, and art specialty high schools that students can attend by passing entrance examinations which are generally highly competitive. These schools are called special-purpose high schools. Autonomous private high schools are relatively free of the policy of the Ministry of Education. Also, there are schools for gifted students. Tuition of many special-purpose high schools, autonomous private high schools, and schools for gifted students are expensive (the average of tuition of special-purpose or autonomous private high school is $5,614 USD per year.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/377928.html|title=???\u00b7??? ?? ?? 603??|date=2009-09-21|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref> One of the schools for gifted students is $7,858 USD per year.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.khan.co.kr/view.html?artid=201702061142001&code=940100&med_id=khan|title=?????? ?? ?? 1200??\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?? ?????? ??|date=2017-02-06|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref> There are a few schools that require more than what is calculated as an average. CheongShim International Academy, Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, and Ha-Na Academy are infamous for their expensive tuition. Simultaneously, these schools are known for students\u2019 high academic achievement and college results, sending more than 50% of their students to \u201cSKY universities\u201d yearly. Other types of high schools include standard public high schools and standard private high schools, both with or without entrance examinations. These high schools do not specialize in a particular field but are more focused on sending their students to top and popular colleges.\n\nHowever, since the emergence of special-purpose, autonomous private schools, international schools, and schools for gifted students, standard high schools struggle to send students to \u201ctop and popular\u201d universities. Standard high schools generally cannot compete with specialized schools\u2019 infrastructures, teaching resources, and activities that improve students' school records. As such, for a student at a standard high school, it is difficult to enter \u201cSKY.\u201d Excellent students and their parents therefore avoid entering into standard high schools. Only students whose grades are too low to enter vocational school (or whose grades are simply average) enter normal high schools. This continues to discourage excellent students from attending normal high schools because the academic level of students is low. This vicious cycle turned standard schools into \u201cslums\u201d in the public eye. As a result, the admissions committees of top universities tend to reject students from standard schools; there is a preference to admit students from special-purpose, autonomous private schools, international schools, and schools for gifted students. This has made the competition of entering such high schools as difficult as entering top universities.\n\nOn noting the schedule of many high school students, it is not unusual for them to return home from school at midnight, or even as late as 3{{nbsp}}AM after intensive \"self-study\" sessions supported by the school or parents. The Korean government has tried to crack down on such damaging study habits in order to allow a more balanced system, mostly by fining many privately run specialty study institutes ([[Hagwon]]) for running classes as late as 2{{nbsp}}am. To solve this problem, the Korean government made a law that bans hagwons from running classes after 10:00 PM, which is often not conformed to. Some such institutes also offer early morning classes for students to attend before going to school in the morning.\n\nThe standard government-issued school curriculum is often noted as rigorous, with as many as 16 or so subjects. Most students choose to also attend privately run profit-making institutes known as [[hagwon]] (\ud559\uc6d0) to boost their academic performance. Core subjects include Korean, English and mathematics, with adequate emphasis on social and physical science subjects. Students do not typically ask questions in the classroom, but prefer to memorise details. It is critical to note that the type and level of subjects may differ from school to school, depending on the degree of selectivity and specialisation of the school. Specialty, optional, expensive, study schools help students memorise questions and answers from previous years' CAT tests and universities' interview questions.\n\nHigh school is not [[mandatory education|mandatory]], unlike middle school education in Korea. However, according to a 2005 study of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) member countries, some 97% of South Korea's young adults do complete high school. This was the highest percentage recorded in any country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4240668.stm |title=South Korea's education success |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 September 2005}}</ref> However, this is mainly due to the fact that there is no such thing as a failing grade in Korea, and most graduate as long as they attend school a certain number of days.\n\nAs it stands, the Korean secondary system of education is highly successful at preparing students for teacher-centric education, in which teachers directly communicate information to students. However, this does not hold true for classroom environments where students are expected to take on self-reliant roles wherein, for the most part, active and creative personalities seem to lead to success.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Zoltan Paul |title=Favourable Teaching Approaches in the South Korean Post Secondary Classroom |publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center]], [[United States Department of Education]] |date=26 November 2009 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507310.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that active student use of the English language in Korean high schools is necessary to enter top universities in Korea, as well as abroad.<ref>{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Paul Z. |title=English Language Necessity: What It means for Korea and Non-English Speaking Countries |publisher=Education Resources Information Center, United States Department of Education |date=January 2012 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED528279.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Vocational===\nSouth Korea once had a strong vocational education system that it rebuilt its shattered economy after the [[Korean War]].

In vocational high schools, student spend half of the time on general courses along with vocational courses as the other half.

Agricultural high schools have a focus on scientific farming and is designed to produce skilled experts in agriculture while fishery and oceanography high schools utilize maritime resource to focus on navigation technology. Since the 1980s, vocational high schools have offered training in various fields to create a labor force that can adjust to the changes across South Korean industry and society. Due to needs of manpower across the heavy and chemical industries in the 1970s. the need for vocational education was crucial. By the 1980s. due the great changes in technology, the objective of vocational education was to create a supply of well trained technicians.  When graduates of vocational high schools are done, the student receives a vocational high school diploma and may choose to enter the workforce or go on to higher education. Many vocational high school graduates end up choose to go to junior colleges to further their education.<ref name=\"alberta17\"/>\n\nAs the university degree grew in prominence to employers during the 1970s and 1980s, the shift towards a more knowledge-based rather than an industrial economy resulted vocational education being pushed back in favor of the university degree for many young South Koreans and their parents. In the 1970s and 1980s, vocational education in South Korea was less than socially acceptable, yet it was another pathway to succeed in obtaining a steady job with a decent income as well as elevate their socioeconomic status, yet many vocational graduates were scorned and stigmatized by their college educated managers despite the importance of their skills for economic development.<ref name=Singmaster>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/global_learning/2016/01/how_vocational_education_can_be_an_economic_driver.html |title=How Vocational Education Can Be an Economic Driver |publisher=Education Week |last=Singmaster |first=Heather |year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/society/south-koreas-graduate-glut/ |title=South Korea's Graduate Glut  |date=June 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWith South Korea's high university entrance rate, the perception of vocational educational still remains in doubt in the minds of many South Koreans. In 2013, only 18 percent of students were enrolled in vocational education programs as it was due to the prestige of university\u2014affluent families that were able to afford the tutoring that is now required for students to pass the notoriously difficult college entrance exam and be able to attend university. With the pervasive bias against vocational education, vocational students are labeled as \"underachievers\", lack a formal higher educational background, and are often looked down upon as vocational jobs are known in Korea as the [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning|\"3Ds\" dirty, demeaning, and dangerous]]. In response, the South Korean government increased the number of spots in universities and the rate of university enrollment was 68.2 percent, an increase of 15 percent over 2014. As a result, to boost the positive image of vocational training, the South Korean government has been collaborating with countries such as Germany, Switzerland, and Austria to examine the innovative solutions that are being implemented to improve vocational education, training, and career options for young South Koreans as alternative to the traditional path of going to university.<ref name=Singmaster/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused |title=Generation jobless |date=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2012 research report from The McKinsey Global Institute reckons that the lifetime value of a college graduate's improved earnings no longer justifies the expense required to obtain the degree and have called on the need for more vocational education to counteract the human cost of performance pressure and the high unemployment rate among the country's university-educated youth.

Meister schools offer apprenticeship based training which takes place at vocational high schools, community and junior colleges. Meister schools also offer employment supportive systems for specialized Meister high school students.

The government is encouraging younger students to visit and see the programs for themselves firsthand to change their perception. Those in doubt on the quality of vocational education are encouraged to spend time working in industry during school vacations so they are up-to-date on current industry practices. Meister schools are continuing to be proving to be a good influence in changing the opinion of vocational education yet only 15,213 (5 percent) of high school students are enrolled in Meister schools with a lack of places unable to meet the demand despite a 100 percent employment rate.

Its name was The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (often abbreviated into \"the Ministry of Education\") since 25 February 2008 to 24 February 2013. The former body, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, was named by the former Minister of Education, who enhanced its function in 2001 because the administration of Kim Dae-jung considered education and human resources development as a matter of the highest priority. As a result of the reform, it began to cover the whole field of human resource development and the minister of education was appointed to the Vice Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 2008, the name was changed into the present one after the Lee Myeong Bak administration annexed the former Ministry of Science and Technology to the Education ministry. \nLike other ministers, the Minister of Education, Science and Technology is appointed by the president. They are mainly chosen from candidates who have an academic background and often resign in a fairly short term (around one year).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n(Ministry of Education has no more work on science and technology because President Park restorated the Ministry works for science and technology)\n\n===Teachers' union===\nAlthough primary- and secondary-school teachers traditionally enjoyed high status, they often were overworked and underpaid during the late 1980s. Salaries were less than those for many other white-collar professions and even some blue-collar jobs. High school teachers, particularly those in the cities, however, received sizable gifts from parents seeking attention for their children, but teaching hours were long and classes crowded (the average class contained around fifty to sixty students).\n\nIn May 1989, teachers established an independent union, the [[Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union|Korean Teachers Union]] (KTU \u2014 ????????(???), ''Jeongyojo''). Their aims included improving working conditions and reforming a school system that they regarded as overly controlled by the Ministry of Education. Although the government promised large increases in allocations for teachers' salaries and facilities, it refused to give the union legal status. Because teachers were civil servants, the government claimed they did not have the right to strike and, even if they did have the right to strike, unionization would undermine the status of teachers as \"role models\" for young Koreans. The government also accused the union of spreading subversive, leftist propaganda that was sympathetic to the communist regime in North Korea.\n\nAccording to a report in ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', the union claimed support from 82 percent of all teachers. The controversy was viewed as representing a major crisis for South Korean education because a large number of teachers (1,500 by November 1989) had been dismissed, violence among union supporters, opponents, and police had occurred at several locations, and class disruptions had caused anxieties for families of students preparing for the college entrance examinations. The union's challenge to the Ministry of Education's control of the system and the charges of subversion had made compromise seem a very remote possibility at the start 1990.<!-- What happened after 1990? -->\n\n===Political involvement in the education system===\nSouth Korea still has issues with North Korea after the [[Korean War]]. This has contributed to South Korea's confrontational stance against North Korea in the education field. For instance, on July 7, 2011, the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]] was criticized for the [[search and seizure]] of a civilian think tank, Korea Higher Education Research Institution (?????????).<ref>{{cite news |first=O-seong (??) |last=Kwon (?) | script-title=ko:???, '?? ???' ?? ???? ???? |date=2011-07-09 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/486615.html |work=The Hankyeoreh |accessdate=2011-07-26 |language=Korean}}</ref> This incident was carried out through a warrant to investigate an alleged South Korean spy who followed an instruction from North Korea with a purpose of instigating university student rallies to stop the ongoing tuition hike in South Korea.\n\n==English education==\nKorea, which is considered the most difficult Asian nation of people to communicate with in English, has an extensive English education history dating back to the Joseon Dynasty. During this time,  Koreans received English education in public institutes, where translators were instructed for conversion of Korean into foreign languages. The Public Foreign Language School established in 1893, educated young males to perform tasks to modernize Korea. This school, unlike facilities such as Yuk Young Gong Won (1886), disregarded social statuses, welcoming more students into the institute and introducing the first Korean foreign language instructors into the field of English education (Chang, 2009).\n\nEnglish was also taught during the Joseon Dynasty in missionary schools, which were established to spread the word of the Christian faith to Koreans, although these schools did not equip its students with the necessary tools to read, write, comprehend and speak the language. Direct Method teaching was uncommon, as instructors were often unqualified as English teachers and the textbook was limited to the Holy Bible. During the Japanese Imperialism Period, Koreans were forced to prioritize the learning and speaking of Japanese. English was offered only as an elective course, though, the instructors were often Japanese, hindering proper English pronunciation. After the liberation of Korea from Japan in 1945, the first national curriculum was established in 1955, launching greater pursuit of English education and returning the nation to speaking its native tongue.\n\nThe relevance of early English education and globalization were brought to the attention of South Korea during the 1986 Asian Games and Seoul Olympic Games, as many came to realize the value of the English language. English is taught as a required subject from the third year of elementary school up to high school, as well as in most universities, with the goal of performing well on the [[TOEIC]] and [[TOEFL]], which are tests of reading, listening and grammar-based English.  For students who achieve high scores, there is also a speaking evaluation. Universities began lecturing in English to help improve competence and though only few were competent enough themselves to lead a class, many elementary school teachers were also recommended to teach in English.\n\nIn 1994, the university entrance examination moved away from testing grammar, towards a more communicative method. Parents redirected the focus of English education to align with exam content (Park, 2009). English Language Education programs focus on ensuring competency to perform effectively as a nation in an era of globalization using proficiency-based language programs that allow students to learn according to their own abilities and interests and driving Koreans to focus more on oral proficiency (Chang, 2009 & Park, 2009). With the new focus placed on oral expertise, there has been an \"intense desire to speak native-like English\" pressuring parents to take measures to ensure the most beneficial English education (Park, 2009).\n\nBecause of large class sizes and other factors in public schools, many parents pay to send their children to private English-language schools in the afternoon or evening. Families invest significant portions of household incomes on the education of children to include English camps and language training abroad. Usually different private English-language schools specialize in teaching elementary school students or in middle and high school students. The most ambitious parents send their children to kindergartens that utilize English exclusively in the classroom. Many children also live abroad for anywhere from a few months to several years to learn English. Sometimes, a Korean mother and her children will move to an English-speaking country for an extended period of time to enhance the children's English ability. In these cases, the father left in Korea is known as a [[gireogi appa]] (Korean: \uae30\ub7ec\uae30 \uc544\ube60), literally a \"goose dad\" who must migrate to see his family.<ref name=english>{{cite news |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/asia/08geese.html |title=For English Studies, Koreans Say Goodbye to Dad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nThere are more than 100,000 Korean students in the U.S. The increase of 10 percent every year helped Korea remain the top student-sending country in the U.S. for a second year, ahead of India and China. Korean students at Harvard University are the third most after Canadian and Chinese. In 2012, 154,000 South Korean students were pursuing degrees at overseas universities, with countries such as Japan, Canada, the United States, and Australia as top destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2013/08/south-korean-student-mobility-takes-a-dip/ |title=South Korean student mobility takes a dip |publisher=ICEF |accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKorean English classes focus on vocabulary, grammar, and reading. Academies tend to include conversation, and some offer debate and presentation.\n\nDue to recent curriculum changes, the education system in Korea is now placing a greater emphasis on English verbal abilities rather than grammatical skills. With influence from the government, English education began to focus on the communicative competence of Korean students emphasizing fluency and comprehension through listening materials. Universities require all first year students to take an English conversation class in their first year and some universities require students to take conversational English classes throughout the entirety of their university life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to a 2003 survey conducted by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, despite being one of the countries in Asia that spent the most money on English-language education, South Korea ranked the lowest among 12 Asian countries in English ability. However, in 2020, South Korea has significantly improved it's English knowledge and proficiency, ranking 6th out of 25 countries in Asia, by Education first. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/regions/asia/south-korea/|title=EF, South Korea|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEnglish as a subject discipline, that is, the study of linguistics, literature, composition/rhetoric, or pedagogy is uncommon except in top-tier or graduate programs in Korea. As a result, despite efforts to recruit foreign faculty in Korean universities, opportunities for tenure are fewer and professorial privileges and salaries are lower than for foreigners contracted to teach major disciplinary courses in English ([[content-based instruction]]). Overall, more native English speakers are being employed as educators in Korea to improve the English education process. Koreans have come to believe native English speakers are the best teachers of the language and to be proficient in the English language gives their children an advantage over others and is an \"educational investment that promises surplus\"(Han, 2007).\n\n==Controversy and criticism==\n\n===Students' health===\nSouth Korea's scarcity of natural resources is often cited as a reason for the rigorousness and fierce competition of its school systems; the academic pressure on its students is arguably the largest in the world. In an article entitled \"An Assault Upon Our Children,\" Se-Woong Koo wrote that \"the system's dark side casts a long shadow. Dominated by tiger moms, cram schools and highly authoritarian teachers, South Korean education produces ranks of overachieving students who pay a stiff price in health and happiness.

[[State school|Public schools]] and [[private school]]s have both been present. Modern reforms to education began in the late 19th century. Since its early history, Korean education has been influenced significantly by Confucian values particularly in its emphasis of formal learning and scholarship through China more than fifteen centuries ago. Confucianism instilled facilities like governance of men by merit, social mobility through education, and the civil examination system based on the system that was developed in China during the Tang Dynasty. As a result, written word and mastery of Chinese classics and literacy became the primary method in choosing individuals for bureaucratic positions, gaining them a respective social status and privileges.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Education Fever: Society, Politics, And The Pursuit of Schooling in South Korea|last=Seth|first=Michael J.|publisher=Hawai'i Studies on Korea|year=2002|isbn=0-8248-2534-9|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe Chosun period was significant in shaping the dynamics and foundation of the Korean education system in that it established schools that ingrained loyalty, orthodoxy, and motivation for official recruitment into its students. The primary means to receive an education during the Chosun period were through village schools (sodang; sojae) and through private tutoring. The sodang was the most common method of formal education in Korea until the late twentieth century, and was usually available only to a handful of neighborhood boys starting at around age seven. In the middle of the sixteenth century, however, the role of official schools gradually declined with the emergence of private academies (sowon), which usually functioned as rural retreats and centers of learning until the majority of them were closed in the 1870s in an effort to centralize authority.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPreparing students for competitive examinations were pronounced during the Chosun era as a means of social mobility and selection of official positions, and remained a basic tenet in Korean education throughout its history. However, this extreme emphasis on education and meritocracy was contrasted by hereditary aristocracy during the Chosun period, where bloodlines and kinship were particularly pronounced. Due to Confucian influences, however, education was able to maintain a fairly equalizing presence over society because of its belief in each individual being capable of benefitting from formal education and achieving enlightenment. Education was also dominated by the exalted scholar-teacher relationship, where teachers held almost a sacred status and were seen as a principal source of ethical counsel. This convention also engendered the tradition of ''remonstrance'', which obligated the scholar to criticize the actions of the government and even the king in order to avoid threatening the Confucian-inspired concept of the moral order of the universe.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe dynastic period did not prioritize special or technical training, and thus a preference for a non-specialized and literary education has remained in Korea. Many of these developments were pronounced towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century when the Chosun dynasty began implementing a Western-style education system as a result of the intrusion of foreign powers into Korea. By 1904, public education was largely confined to Seoul, which was generally resisted by the public as well as government officials. This maintained the dominance of sodang and other traditional institutions as the primary means to receive a formal education. However, as a result of financial support from members of the royal family and American missionary activities and schools, the number of schools began to increase in the early 1900s. As a means to promote basic literacy among its citizens, Korea also introduced mixed script of Hangeul and Chinese characters into its instruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation (1905-1945), Korea was able to establish a comprehensive and modern system of national education through centralization and deliberate planning of integrating Japanese occupational professionalism and values. However, there were severe restrictions like the lack of access to education beyond the elementary level for Koreans and the manipulation of education to indoctrinate Korean subjects to be loyal to the Japanese empire, which led to turmoil and discontent among Koreans who were forced to assimilate. The Japanese emphasized low-level and non-professional track schooling for Koreans which was pronounced by the Educational Ordinance of 1911, where Japanese residents had fourteen years of schooling available while Koreans only had eight years available to them, unless they were civil servants wherein eleven was the maximum. Schooling was primarily based on Japanese values, literacy, and history as an attempt to make young Koreans loyal to the Japanese state and indirectly wipe out Korean culture and history. As a minor development, the Educational Ordinance of 1922 was enacted, which reopened the Seoul Teachers' School, extended elementary and secondary education, and added college preparatory or advanced technical training to the curriculum.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHigher education became a central issue for upper-class and upwardly mobile Koreans, who were provided very limited access to these institutions as well as positions of administration and teaching. Furthermore, with the introduction of the Educational Ordinance of 1938, Korean schools were to be identical to Japanese ones in organization and curriculum, which made education a highly militarized and regimented tool for forced assimilation and militarization.<ref name=\":0\" /> These last few years of Japanese rule pronounced the discontent of Koreans whose social and political climates had been deeply affected.\n\n===Post-war years===\nAfter [[Gwangbokjeol]] and the liberation from Japan, the Korean government began to study and discuss for a new [[philosophy of education]]. The new educational philosophy was created under the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]](USAMGIK) with a focus on [[democratic education]]. The new system attempted to make education available to all students equally and promote the educational administration to be more self-governing. It also emphasized a decentralized education which local and community control in order to maintain educational autonomy from authoritarian policies. Specific policies included: re-educating [[teacher]]s, lowering [[functional illiteracy]] by educating adults, restoration of the [[Korean language]] for [[technical terminology]], and expansion of various educational institutions.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web |url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0005524 |script-title=ko:?? |publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |work=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |accessdate=January 22, 2014 |language=Korean |trans-title=Education}}</ref> This system did not instigate radical change, however, to the extent that it maintained the centralized and authoritarian administration created by the Japanese with no meaningful changes. It did, however, abet in the Koreanization of South Korean education through the initiative of Korean leaders by promoting Hangeul, removing Japanese instruction practices, and emphasizing Korean history, geography, and literature. Aside from these developments, the most striking feature of the U.S. military occupation was the significant expansion of schooling and the student population.\n\nFollowing the [[Korean War]], the government of Syngman Rhee reversed many of these reforms after 1948, when only primary schools remained in most cases coeducational and, because of a lack of resources, education was compulsory only up to the sixth grade. In 1948, the prevalent debate in South Korean education was whether to maintain an elitist multitrack path based on the prewar Japanese colonial model, or adopt an open American system that avoided early tracking and did not terminalize primary or secondary education.\n\nDuring the years when Rhee and [[Park Chung Hee]] were in power, the control of education was gradually taken out of the hands of local school boards and concentrated in a centralized Ministry of Education. In the late 1980s, the ministry was responsible for administration of schools, allocation of resources, setting of enrollment quotas, certification of schools and teachers, curriculum development (including the issuance of textbook guidelines), and other basic policy decisions. Provincial and special city boards of education still existed. Although each board was composed of seven members who were supposed to be selected by popularly elected legislative bodies, this arrangement ceased to function after 1973. Subsequently, school board members were approved by the minister of education. In high school they would call it year one grade (9th grader) and year 2 would be (10th grader) and so on. Therefore, a multitrack and single secondary school system prevailed, largely due to the fact that administrators did not want to divide institutions, and parents were not receptive to the idea of two entrance exams''.'' The outcome the 1950 MOE proposal for a uniform system was a 6-4-3-4 academic schedule, which entailed 6 years of primary school, 4 years of middle school, 3 years of vocational or academic high school, and 4 years of college or university. A complex system of technical and vocational training was also added to educational policy, where children were able to decide on an academic versus a vocational route early on in their academic career. Many opposers of this policy actually viewed it as positive because they believed that the academic route would seem more prolific and parents and students would be willing to pursue it more than the vocational route. Furthermore, even though a few local school boards were established toward the late 1940s, they were not appreciated by many Koreans because there was a widespread notion that a uniform and centrally controlled system is best. A rigorous and uniform national curriculum was established in the mid-1950s and there were significant efforts to make school accessible for everyone, especially in the context of Rhee's declaration of compulsory universal literacy and basic education. While universal basic education eliminated disparities between classes, competition became very fierce due to restricted entry into higher academic tiers, which contributed to the predominant \"education fever\" that is still prevalent in South Korea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, there was a difficulty in harnessing the demand for education towards the needs of an industrializing economy, which caused a growth in private foundations in order to supply the public demand for schooling. Furthermore, the 60s and 70s were characterized by a large demand to direct educational development to economic development, which necessitated a greater emphasis on vocational and technical training rather than academic training in order to help citizens gain skills that would supply the country's economic needs. Even though there were major criticisms on behalf of the public for this emphasis on vocational training due to a clashing with Confucian values, the state continued to strengthen vocational education, especially after the shift in industrialization to heavy chemical and machine industries in the 70s. The 1960s and 70s experienced turmoil in education systems due to public resistance and the uncooperativeness of private schools with the state as they attempted to supply public demand. While the state was able to fulfill many of its economic goals, it came at a great social and political cost like the depopulation of rural areas and President Park's assassination <ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nMost observers agree that South Korea's spectacular progress in modernization and economic growth since the [[Korean War]] is largely attributable to the willingness of individuals to invest a large amount of resources in education: the improvement of \"human capital.\" The traditional esteem for the educated man, now extends to scientists, technicians, and others working with specialized knowledge. Highly educated technocrats and economic planners could claim much of the credit for their country's economic successes since the 1960s. Scientific professions were generally regarded as the most prestigious by South Koreans in the 1980s.\n\nStatistics demonstrate the success of South Korea's national education programs. In 1945 the adult literacy rate was estimated at 22 percent; by 1970 adult literacy was 87.6 percent<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\">Andrea Matles Savada and William Shaw, editors. ''South Korea: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.</ref> and, by the late 1980s, sources estimated it at around 93 percent.<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> Although only primary school (grades one through six) was compulsory, percentages of age-groups of children and young people enrolled in secondary level schools were equivalent to those found in industrialized countries, including Japan. Approximately 4.8 million students in the eligible age-group were attending primary school in 1985. The percentage of students going on to optional middle school the same year was more than 99 percent. Approximately 34 percent, one of the world's highest rates of secondary-school graduates attended institutions of higher education in 1987, a rate similar to Japan's (about 30 percent) and exceeding Britain's (20 percent).\n\nGovernment expenditure on education has been generous. In 1975, it was 220 billion [[South Korean won|won]],<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> the equivalent of 2.2 percent of the gross national product, or 13.9 percent of total government expenditure. By 1986, education expenditure had reached 3.76 trillion [[South Korean won|won]], or 4.5 percent of the GNP, and 27.3 percent of government budget allocations.\n\nThe 1980s and 90s marked an era of democratization and economic prosperity in South Korea, partly due to the \"education fever\". In 1991, for the first time in thirty years, the country elected provincial and city councils in order to localize education, and leaders like Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung were able to enact major overhauls to the education system in order to accommodate democratization through methods like abolishing on-campus ROTCS training and political mobilization of students, legalization of teacher unions, and removing anti-Communist texts<ref name=\":0\" />. The MOE began to shift away from a uniform curriculum by allowing school boards to implement some minor variations in instructional content. Literacy became virtually universal in South Korea while it rose up in international ranks in math and science, especially. \n\nDespite South Korea's transition to democracy, traditional and Confucian values remained very strong. Overall, the huge strides in educational development came at the cost of intense pressure among students, high suicide rates, and family financial struggles through investment in schooling and private tutoring. \n\n===Student activism===\nStudent activism has a long and honorable history in Korea. Students in [[Joseon]] secondary schools often became involved in the intense factional struggles of the scholar-official class. Students played a major role in Korea's independence movement, particularly in March 1, 1919, which was a protest based on students' growing resentment towards restrictive, discriminatory, and hostile Japanese occupation and instruction practices. Students were also heavily involved in repeated national efforts and demonstrations against Japanese policies, with instances like the Gwangju Student Movement in 1929 and the June 10, 1926 funeral line protest. \n\nStudents protested against the regimes of [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Observers noted, however, that while student activists in the past generally embraced liberal and democratic values, the new generation of militants in the 1980s were far more radical. Most participants adopted some version of the [[minjung]] ideology but was also animated by strong feelings of popular [[nationalism]] and [[xenophobia]].\n\nOne of the most extreme and landmark movements was the Kwangju Massacre in 1980, where students were driven by a strong will to rebel through Marxist influences against the martial law government. This radicalism was paralleled by the communist sympathizing and radicalism of students in the 1940s and 50s as a result of American occupation.\n\nThe most militant university students, perhaps about 5 percent of the total enrollment at [[Seoul National University]] and comparable figures at other institutions in the [[Seoul|capital]] during the late 1980s, were organized into small circles or cells rarely containing more than fifty members. Police estimated that there were 72 such organizations of varying orientation, having the change of curriculum and education system of South Korea people have been enriched in an imaginary way that makes them propel in all their studies.\n\n===Reforms in the 1980s===\nFollowing the assumption of power by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] in 1980, the Ministry of Education implemented a number of reforms designed to make the system more fair and to increase higher education opportunities for the population at large. In a very popular move, the ministry dramatically increased enrollment at large.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nSocial emphasis on education was not without its problems, as it tended to accentuate class differences. In the late 1980s, a college degree was considered necessary for entering the middle class; there were no alternative pathways of social advancement, with the possible exception of a military career, outside higher education. People without a college education, including skilled workers with vocational school backgrounds, often were treated as second-class citizens by their white-collar, college-educated managers, despite the importance of their skills for economic development. Intense competition for places at the most prestigious universities\u2014the sole gateway into elite circles\u2014promoted, like the old Confucian system, a sterile emphasis on rote memorization in order to pass secondary school and college entrance examinations. Particularly after a dramatic expansion of college enrollments in the early 1980s, South Korea faced the problem of what to do about a large number of young people staying in school for a long time, usually at great sacrifice to themselves and their families, and then faced with limited job opportunities because their skills were not marketable.\n\n===Great recession===\nWith a slowing economy, a rigid and fast-changing job market as a result of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] and the demise of the [[Industrial Age]], many young South Korean high school graduates are now realizing that high entrance examination and test scores for the promise of future career success did not carry the same weight as it once did.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/asia/07pride.html |title=With Wounded Pride, Unemployed Koreans Quietly Turn to Manual Labor |last=FACKLER |first=MARTIN  |date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> In 2013, 43,000 South Koreans in their twenties, and 21,000 in their thirties lost their jobs.<ref name=ICEF>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2014/01/high-performance-high-pressure-in-south-koreas-education-system/ |title=High performance, high pressure in South Korea's education system |publisher=ICEF Monitor |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> According to a 2013 survey conducted by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, nearly four out of every 10 young workers in their 20s and 30s said they were overeducated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |title=Fighting for Equity in Education |date=November 24, 2013 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118102555/http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |archive-date=November 18, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Stratfor\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/south-korea-votes-changing-region |title=South Korea Votes in a Changing Region |date=April 13, 2016 |publisher=Stratfor}}</ref> In 2013, fewer young South Koreans chose go on to university after finishing high school as the unemployment rate for university graduates continues to soar, falling income for college graduates continues to decline and the value of a college degree has now becoming increasingly in doubt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/09/07/2013090700379.html |title=Fewer Young People Go On to University |publisher=The Chosun |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> Educational reforms initiated by the South Korean government have become more dynamic and that university is no longer the only guarantee of a career.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/revamped-vocational-education-may-have-prevented-graduate-glut-ex-korean-minister?page=1 | title=Earlier introduction of vocational education 'could have prevented' S Korea's grad glut | publisher=Today | date=24 July 2015 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Ng Jing Yng}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/404739/1 | title=Meister of job placement | publisher=The Dong-A-Ilbo | date=22 September 2012 | accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref> Government measures have also been prompted to encourage young unemployed college graduates to look at other employment possibilities such as starting a business or seeking employment opportunities at smaller and medium size businesses.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\">{{cite web | url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20091116000035 | title=Lee urges job seekers to look for opportunities at smaller companies | publisher=The Korea Herald | date=30 March 2010 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> Former President [[Lee Myung-Bak]] urged young unemployed job seekers to start looking at other employment possibilities with small and medium-sized businesses beyond large conglomerates.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/09/01/2016090101665.html | title=Young Jobseekers Must Look Beyond Big Business | publisher=The Chosun llbo | date=1 September 2016 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn oversaturated and overqualified labor market has resulted in shortages of skilled blue-collar labor and a lack of qualified vocational employees for small and medium-sized businesses, young South Koreans now realize that a college degree no longer guarantees a job as it once did.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\"/> With the nation's high university entrance rate, South Korea has produced an overeducated and underemployed labor force with many being unable find employment at the level of their education qualifications.

Many students in Korea start kindergarten at the Western age of three and will, therefore, continue to study in kindergarten for three or four years, before starting their 'formal education' in 'grade one' of primary school. Many private kindergartens offer their classes in English to give students a 'head-start' in the mandatory English education they would receive later in public school. Kindergartens often pay homage to the expectations of parents with impressive courses, graduation ceremonies, complete with diplomas and gowns. Korean kindergartens are expected to start teaching basic maths, reading and writing to children, including education on how to count, add, subtract, and read and write in Korean, and often in English and Chinese. Children in Korean kindergartens are also taught using games focused on education and coordination, such as \"playing doctor\" to teach body parts, food and nutrition, and work positions for adults. Songs, dances, and memorization are a big part of Korean kindergarten education.\n\n==Primary education==\n[[Elementary schools]] ({{lang-ko|\ucd08\ub4f1 \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''chodeung hakgyo'') consists of grades [[First grade|one]] to [[sixth grade|six]] (age 8 to age 13 in [[East Asian age reckoning|Korean years]]\u20147 to 12 in western years). The South Korean government changed its name to the current form from ''Citizens' school'' ({{lang-ko|\uad6d\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''Gukmin hakgyo'') in 1996. The former name was shortened from \ud669\uad6d \uc2e0\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ??????  (''Hwangguk sinmin hakgyo''), which means ''school of the people who are subjects of the Empire (of Japan)''.\n\nIn [[elementary school]], students learn the following subjects.  The curriculum differs from grades 1\u20132 to grades 3\u20136.<ref>[[:ko:????? ????]]</ref>\n\n'''Grades 1\u20132:'''\n*''We Are First Graders'' ({{lang-ko|1\ud559\ub144 1??}}) (grade 1 only)\n*Korean (listening, speaking, reading, writing)\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*''Disciplined Life'' ({{lang-ko|????}})\n*''Sensible Life'' ({{lang-ko|??????}})\n*''Enjoyable Life'' ({{lang-ko|?????}})\n*Above three changed a few years ago into \"Spring(\ubd04,Bom)\",\"Summer(\uc5ec\ub984,Yeo-Reum)\",\"Fall(\uac00\uc744,Ga-eul)\",\"Winter(\uaca8\uc6b8,Gyeo-Ul)\"\n*[[Physical Education]]\n\n'''Grades 3\u20136:'''\n*Korean (listening, speaking, reading, writing)\n*[[English as a second or foreign language|English]]\n*[[Character education|Moral Education]]\n*[[Social Studies]]\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*[[Science]]\n*[[Art]]\n*[[Music]]\n*Practical Arts\n*[[Physical Education]]\n\nUsually, the class teacher covers most of the subjects; however, there are some specialised teachers in professions such as physical education and [[foreign language]]s, including [[English as a second or foreign language|English]].\n\nThose who wish to become a primary school teacher must major in primary education, which is specially designed to cultivate primary school teachers. In Korea, most of the primary teachers are working for public primary schools.\n\nBecause corporal punishment has been officially and legally prohibited in every classroom since 2011, many teachers and some parents raised with corporal punishment are becoming more concerned about what they see as worsening discipline problems. Some teachers continue to use corporal punishment discreetly.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeyup S. |last=Kwaak |title=Extreme Corporal Punishment Case in Seoul School Sparks Debate |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=28 June 2014 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/06/28/extreme-corporal-punishment-case-in-seoul-school-sparks-debate/}}</ref>\n\n==Secondary education==\nIn 1987, there were approximately 4,895,354 students enrolled in middle schools and high schools, with approximately 150,873 teachers.

Given the importance of entry into higher education, the majority of students attended general or academic high schools in 1987: 1,397,359 students, or 60 percent of the total, attended general or academic high schools, as compared with 840,265 students in vocational secondary schools. Vocational schools specialized in a number of fields: primarily agriculture, fishery, commerce, trades, merchant marine, engineering, and the arts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nCompetitive entrance examinations at the middle-school level were abolished in 1968. Although as of the late 1980s, students still had to pass noncompetitive qualifying examinations, they were assigned to secondary institutions by lottery, or else by location within the boundary of the school district. Secondary schools, formerly ranked according to the quality of their students, have been equalized, with a portion of good, mediocre, and poor students being assigned to each one. The reform, however, did not equalize secondary schools completely. In Seoul, students who performed well in qualifying examinations were allowed to attend better quality schools in a \"common\" district, while other students attended schools in one of five geographical districts. The reforms applied equally to public and private schools whose enrollments were strictly controlled by the Ministry of Education.\n\nIn South Korea, the grade of a student is reset as the student progresses through elementary, middle and high school. To differentiate the grades between students, one would often state the grade based on the level of education he/she is in. For example, a student in the first year of middle school would be referred to as \"First grade in Middle School (\uc911\ud559\uad50 1\ud559\ub144.)\".\n\nMiddle schools are called ''Jung hakgyo'' (\uc911\ud559\uad50) in Korean, which literally means ''middle school''. High schools are called ''Godeung hakgyo'' (\uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50) in Korean, literally meaning \"high school\".\n\n===Middle school===\n[[Middle schools]] in South Korea consist of three grades. Most students enter at age 12 or 13 and graduate at age 15 or 16. These three grades correspond roughly to grades 7\u20139 in the North American system and Years 8\u201311 in the [[Education in England|English]] and [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] system.\n\nMiddle school in South Korea marks a considerable shift from primary school, with students expected to take their studies much more seriously. At most middle schools, regulation uniforms and haircuts are enforced fairly strictly, and some aspects of students' lives are highly controlled. Like in primary school, students spend most of the day in the same homeroom classroom with the same classmates; however, students have different teachers for each subject. Teachers move around from classroom to classroom, and few teachers apart from those who teach special subjects have their own rooms to which students come. Homeroom teachers (\ub2f4\uc784 \uad50\uc0ac, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''damim gyosa'') play a very important role in students' lives.\n\nMost middle school students take seven lessons a day, and in addition to this usually have an early morning block that precedes regular lessons and an eighth lesson specializing in an extra subject to finish the day. Unlike high school, middle school curricula do not vary much from school to school. Korean, Algebra, Geometry, English, social studies, and science form the core subjects, with students also receiving instruction in [[music]], [[art]], PE, [[korean history]], [[ethics]], [[home economics]], secondary language, technology, and [[Hanja]]. Which subjects students study and to what extent may change from year to year. All regular lessons are 45 minutes long. Before school, students have an extra block of 30 minutes or longer that may be used for self-study, watching Educational Broadcast System (EBS) broadcasts, or for personal or class administration. Beginning in 2008, students attended school Monday through Friday, and had a half-day every 1st, 3rd, and 5th (calendar permitting) Saturday of the month. Saturday lessons usually included Club Activity (CA) lessons, where students could participate in extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, many schools have regular classes without extracurricular activities because schools and parents want students to study more. Despite this, from 2012 onwards, primary and secondary schools, including middle schools, will no longer hold Saturday classes. To this day, many schools still hold Saturday classes illegally because the parents want their children to go to school and study.<ref name=\"Thomaswhite.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thomaswhite.com/world-markets/south-korea-an-end-to-saturday-classes/ |title=South Korea: An end to Saturday classes &#124; Thomas White International |publisher=Thomaswhite.com |date=2011-09-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the government abolished entrance examinations for middle school students, replacing it with a system whereby primary school students within the same district are selected for middle schools by a lottery system. This has the effect of equalizing the quality of students from school to school, though schools in areas where students come from more privileged backgrounds still tend to outperform schools in poorer areas. Until recently, most middle schools have been same-sex, though in the past decade most new middle schools have been coed, and some previously same-sex schools have converted to coed as well. Some schools have converted to same-sex due to pressure from parents who thought that their children would study better in [[single-sex education]].\n\nAs with primary schools, students pass from grade to grade regardless of knowledge or academic achievement, the result being that classes often have students of vastly different abilities learning the same subject material together. In the final year of middle school examination scores become very important for top students hoping to gain entrance into top high schools, and for those in the middle hoping to get into an academic rather than a technical or vocational high school. Otherwise, examinations and marks only matter insofar as living up to a self-enforced concept of position in the school ranking system. There are some standardized examinations for certain subjects, and teachers of academic subjects are expected to follow approved textbooks, but generally middle school teachers have more flexibility over curricula and methods than teachers in high school.\n\nMore than 95% of middle school students also attend independently owned, after-school tutoring agencies known as \u201chagwon,\u201d or \"cram schools,\u201d in order to receive extra instruction from private tutors. The core subjects, especially the cumulative subjects of Korean, English, and math, receive the most emphasis. Some \u201dhagwon\u201d specialize in just one subject, while others offer all core subjects, constituting a second round of schooling every day for their pupils. Indeed, some parents place more stress on their children's \u201dhagwon\u201d studies than their public school studies. Additionally, many students attend academies for things such as martial arts or music. Thus, many middle school students, like their high school counterparts, return from a day of schooling well after sunset. The average South Korean family spends 20% percent of its income on after-hours cram schools, more spending per capita on private tutoring than any other country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education-jan-june11-koreaschools_01-21/ | title=In Hypercompetitive South Korea, Pressures Mount on Young Pupils | publisher=PBS | date=21 January 2011 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bd4a52a-3b06-11e3-a7ec-00144feab7de | title=Education in South Korea: system must change to satisfy country's and pupils' needs | publisher=Financial Times | date=5 November 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Song Jung-a}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20051653/seeing-the-shared-traits.html | title=Seeing the shared traits | publisher=The Slovak Spectator | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=On My Own: Korean Businesses and Race Relations in America | publisher=University of Chicago Press. | author=In-Jin Yoon | year=1997 | page=78}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/news/News_View.asp?nseq=146856 | title=Korean parents spending most of income on children's education | publisher=Arirang News | date=7 May 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===High school===\n[[High school]]s in South Korea teach students for three years, from first grade (age 15\u201317) to third grade (age 17\u201319), and students commonly graduate at age 18 or 19. High school students are commonly expected to study increasingly long hours each year moving toward graduation, to become competitive and enter extremely attractive universities in Korea. Many high school students wake and leave home in the morning at 5{{nbsp}}am. When the school is over at 4 pm, they go to a studying room in the school or to a library to study instead of going home. This is called \u201cyaja,\u201d which literally means \u201cevening self-study.\u201d They don't need to go home to eat dinner since most schools provide paid dinner for students. After finishing yaja (which usually ends at 11:00 pm, but later than 12:00 am at some schools), they return home after studying, then return to specialty study schools (which are called [[Hagwon]]) often until 3{{nbsp}}am, from Monday to Friday. In addition, they often study on weekends.\n\nThe yaja had not been truly \u201cself\u201d study for more than 30 years; all high school students were forced to do it. From the 2010s, the Ministry of Education has encouraged high schools to free students of yaja and to allow them to do it whenever they want. Many standard public high schools near Seoul are now no longer forcing students do it. But private high schools, special-purpose high schools (such as science high schools and foreign language high schools), or normal schools far from Seoul are still forcing students to do yaja.\n\nA common saying in Korea is: \u201cIf you sleep three hours each night, you may get into a top 'SKY university\u2019(Seoul National University, Korea University, and/or Yonsei University). If you sleep four hours each night, you may get into another university. If you sleep five or more hours each night, especially in your last year of high school, forget about getting into any university.\u201d Accordingly, many high school students in their final year do not have any free time for holidays, birthdays or vacations before the CSATs (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korean: \uc218\ub2a5, [[College Scholastic Ability Test|Suneung]]), which are university entrance exams held by the Ministry of Education. Surprisingly, some high school students are offered chances to travel with family to enjoy fun and relaxing vacations, but these offers are often refused on the first suggestion by the students themselves, and increasingly on later additional trips if any, due to peer influences and a fear of \u201cfalling behind\u201d in classes. Many high school students seem to prefer staying with friends and studying, rather than taking a break. \u201cSkipping classes\u201d for fun is extremely rare in Korea. Rebellious students will often stay in class and use smartphones connected to the internet to chat with friends behind the teacher's back during classes.\n\nHigh schools in Korea can be divided into specialty tracks that accord with a student's interest and career path or a normal state high school. For special high schools, there are science ([[Seoul Science High School|Science high school]]), foreign language, international, and art specialty high schools that students can attend by passing entrance examinations which are generally highly competitive. These schools are called special-purpose high schools. Autonomous private high schools are relatively free of the policy of the Ministry of Education. Also, there are schools for gifted students. Tuition of many special-purpose high schools, autonomous private high schools, and schools for gifted students are expensive (the average of tuition of special-purpose or autonomous private high school is $5,614 USD per year.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/377928.html|title=???\u00b7??? ?? ?? 603??|date=2009-09-21|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref> One of the schools for gifted students is $7,858 USD per year.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.khan.co.kr/view.html?artid=201702061142001&code=940100&med_id=khan|title=?????? ?? ?? 1200??\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?? ?????? ??|date=2017-02-06|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref> There are a few schools that require more than what is calculated as an average. CheongShim International Academy, Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, and Ha-Na Academy are infamous for their expensive tuition. Simultaneously, these schools are known for students\u2019 high academic achievement and college results, sending more than 50% of their students to \u201cSKY universities\u201d yearly. Other types of high schools include standard public high schools and standard private high schools, both with or without entrance examinations. These high schools do not specialize in a particular field but are more focused on sending their students to top and popular colleges.\n\nHowever, since the emergence of special-purpose, autonomous private schools, international schools, and schools for gifted students, standard high schools struggle to send students to \u201ctop and popular\u201d universities. Standard high schools generally cannot compete with specialized schools\u2019 infrastructures, teaching resources, and activities that improve students' school records. As such, for a student at a standard high school, it is difficult to enter \u201cSKY.\u201d Excellent students and their parents therefore avoid entering into standard high schools. Only students whose grades are too low to enter vocational school (or whose grades are simply average) enter normal high schools. This continues to discourage excellent students from attending normal high schools because the academic level of students is low. This vicious cycle turned standard schools into \u201cslums\u201d in the public eye. As a result, the admissions committees of top universities tend to reject students from standard schools; there is a preference to admit students from special-purpose, autonomous private schools, international schools, and schools for gifted students. This has made the competition of entering such high schools as difficult as entering top universities.\n\nOn noting the schedule of many high school students, it is not unusual for them to return home from school at midnight, or even as late as 3{{nbsp}}AM after intensive \"self-study\" sessions supported by the school or parents. The Korean government has tried to crack down on such damaging study habits in order to allow a more balanced system, mostly by fining many privately run specialty study institutes ([[Hagwon]]) for running classes as late as 2{{nbsp}}am. To solve this problem, the Korean government made a law that bans hagwons from running classes after 10:00 PM, which is often not conformed to. Some such institutes also offer early morning classes for students to attend before going to school in the morning.\n\nThe standard government-issued school curriculum is often noted as rigorous, with as many as 16 or so subjects. Most students choose to also attend privately run profit-making institutes known as [[hagwon]] (\ud559\uc6d0) to boost their academic performance. Core subjects include Korean, English and mathematics, with adequate emphasis on social and physical science subjects. Students do not typically ask questions in the classroom, but prefer to memorise details. It is critical to note that the type and level of subjects may differ from school to school, depending on the degree of selectivity and specialisation of the school. Specialty, optional, expensive, study schools help students memorise questions and answers from previous years' CAT tests and universities' interview questions.\n\nHigh school is not [[mandatory education|mandatory]], unlike middle school education in Korea. However, according to a 2005 study of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) member countries, some 97% of South Korea's young adults do complete high school. This was the highest percentage recorded in any country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4240668.stm |title=South Korea's education success |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 September 2005}}</ref> However, this is mainly due to the fact that there is no such thing as a failing grade in Korea, and most graduate as long as they attend school a certain number of days.\n\nAs it stands, the Korean secondary system of education is highly successful at preparing students for teacher-centric education, in which teachers directly communicate information to students. However, this does not hold true for classroom environments where students are expected to take on self-reliant roles wherein, for the most part, active and creative personalities seem to lead to success.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Zoltan Paul |title=Favourable Teaching Approaches in the South Korean Post Secondary Classroom |publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center]], [[United States Department of Education]] |date=26 November 2009 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507310.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that active student use of the English language in Korean high schools is necessary to enter top universities in Korea, as well as abroad.<ref>{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Paul Z. |title=English Language Necessity: What It means for Korea and Non-English Speaking Countries |publisher=Education Resources Information Center, United States Department of Education |date=January 2012 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED528279.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Vocational===\nSouth Korea once had a strong vocational education system that it rebuilt its shattered economy after the [[Korean War]]. For students who do not wish to enter university, vocational high schools specializing in fields such as technology, agriculture or finance are available, such that students are employable right after graduation.

In vocational high schools, student spend half of the time on general courses along with vocational courses as the other half.

Agricultural high schools have a focus on scientific farming and is designed to produce skilled experts in agriculture while fishery and oceanography high schools utilize maritime resource to focus on navigation technology. Since the 1980s, vocational high schools have offered training in various fields to create a labor force that can adjust to the changes across South Korean industry and society. Due to needs of manpower across the heavy and chemical industries in the 1970s. the need for vocational education was crucial. By the 1980s. due the great changes in technology, the objective of vocational education was to create a supply of well trained technicians.  When graduates of vocational high schools are done, the student receives a vocational high school diploma and may choose to enter the workforce or go on to higher education. Many vocational high school graduates end up choose to go to junior colleges to further their education.<ref name=\"alberta17\"/>\n\nAs the university degree grew in prominence to employers during the 1970s and 1980s, the shift towards a more knowledge-based rather than an industrial economy resulted vocational education being pushed back in favor of the university degree for many young South Koreans and their parents. In the 1970s and 1980s, vocational education in South Korea was less than socially acceptable, yet it was another pathway to succeed in obtaining a steady job with a decent income as well as elevate their socioeconomic status, yet many vocational graduates were scorned and stigmatized by their college educated managers despite the importance of their skills for economic development.<ref name=Singmaster>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/global_learning/2016/01/how_vocational_education_can_be_an_economic_driver.html |title=How Vocational Education Can Be an Economic Driver |publisher=Education Week |last=Singmaster |first=Heather |year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/society/south-koreas-graduate-glut/ |title=South Korea's Graduate Glut  |date=June 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWith South Korea's high university entrance rate, the perception of vocational educational still remains in doubt in the minds of many South Koreans. In 2013, only 18 percent of students were enrolled in vocational education programs as it was due to the prestige of university\u2014affluent families that were able to afford the tutoring that is now required for students to pass the notoriously difficult college entrance exam and be able to attend university. With the pervasive bias against vocational education, vocational students are labeled as \"underachievers\", lack a formal higher educational background, and are often looked down upon as vocational jobs are known in Korea as the [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning|\"3Ds\" dirty, demeaning, and dangerous]]. In response, the South Korean government increased the number of spots in universities and the rate of university enrollment was 68.2 percent, an increase of 15 percent over 2014. As a result, to boost the positive image of vocational training, the South Korean government has been collaborating with countries such as Germany, Switzerland, and Austria to examine the innovative solutions that are being implemented to improve vocational education, training, and career options for young South Koreans as alternative to the traditional path of going to university.<ref name=Singmaster/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused |title=Generation jobless |date=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2012 research report from The McKinsey Global Institute reckons that the lifetime value of a college graduate's improved earnings no longer justifies the expense required to obtain the degree and have called on the need for more vocational education to counteract the human cost of performance pressure and the high unemployment rate among the country's university-educated youth. The South Korean government, schools, and industry with assistance from the Swiss government and industry are now revamping and modernizing the country's once strong vocational education sector with a network of vocational schools called \"Meister Schools\".

Meister schools offer apprenticeship based training which takes place at vocational high schools, community and junior colleges. Meister schools also offer employment supportive systems for specialized Meister high school students. The South Korean government has established an \"Employment First, College Later\" philosophy whereas after graduation students are encouraged to seek employment first before making plans for university.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"Park\"/> With changing demands in the Information Age workforce, global forecasts show that by 2030, the demand for vocational skills will increase in contrast to the declining demand for unskilled labor largely due to technological advances.<ref name=Murisa/>\n\nNegative perception and stigmatization of vocational education continues to be the largest challenge in South Korea. The government is encouraging younger students to visit and see the programs for themselves firsthand to change their perception. Those in doubt on the quality of vocational education are encouraged to spend time working in industry during school vacations so they are up-to-date on current industry practices. Meister schools are continuing to be proving to be a good influence in changing the opinion of vocational education yet only 15,213 (5 percent) of high school students are enrolled in Meister schools with a lack of places unable to meet the demand despite a 100 percent employment rate.

Its name was The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (often abbreviated into \"the Ministry of Education\") since 25 February 2008 to 24 February 2013. The former body, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, was named by the former Minister of Education, who enhanced its function in 2001 because the administration of Kim Dae-jung considered education and human resources development as a matter of the highest priority. As a result of the reform, it began to cover the whole field of human resource development and the minister of education was appointed to the Vice Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 2008, the name was changed into the present one after the Lee Myeong Bak administration annexed the former Ministry of Science and Technology to the Education ministry. \nLike other ministers, the Minister of Education, Science and Technology is appointed by the president. They are mainly chosen from candidates who have an academic background and often resign in a fairly short term (around one year).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n(Ministry of Education has no more work on science and technology because President Park restorated the Ministry works for science and technology)\n\n===Teachers' union===\nAlthough primary- and secondary-school teachers traditionally enjoyed high status, they often were overworked and underpaid during the late 1980s. Salaries were less than those for many other white-collar professions and even some blue-collar jobs. High school teachers, particularly those in the cities, however, received sizable gifts from parents seeking attention for their children, but teaching hours were long and classes crowded (the average class contained around fifty to sixty students).\n\nIn May 1989, teachers established an independent union, the [[Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union|Korean Teachers Union]] (KTU \u2014 ????????(???), ''Jeongyojo''). Their aims included improving working conditions and reforming a school system that they regarded as overly controlled by the Ministry of Education. Although the government promised large increases in allocations for teachers' salaries and facilities, it refused to give the union legal status. Because teachers were civil servants, the government claimed they did not have the right to strike and, even if they did have the right to strike, unionization would undermine the status of teachers as \"role models\" for young Koreans. The government also accused the union of spreading subversive, leftist propaganda that was sympathetic to the communist regime in North Korea.\n\nAccording to a report in ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', the union claimed support from 82 percent of all teachers. The controversy was viewed as representing a major crisis for South Korean education because a large number of teachers (1,500 by November 1989) had been dismissed, violence among union supporters, opponents, and police had occurred at several locations, and class disruptions had caused anxieties for families of students preparing for the college entrance examinations. The union's challenge to the Ministry of Education's control of the system and the charges of subversion had made compromise seem a very remote possibility at the start 1990.<!-- What happened after 1990? -->\n\n===Political involvement in the education system===\nSouth Korea still has issues with North Korea after the [[Korean War]]. This has contributed to South Korea's confrontational stance against North Korea in the education field. For instance, on July 7, 2011, the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]] was criticized for the [[search and seizure]] of a civilian think tank, Korea Higher Education Research Institution (?????????).<ref>{{cite news |first=O-seong (??) |last=Kwon (?) | script-title=ko:???, '?? ???' ?? ???? ???? |date=2011-07-09 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/486615.html |work=The Hankyeoreh |accessdate=2011-07-26 |language=Korean}}</ref> This incident was carried out through a warrant to investigate an alleged South Korean spy who followed an instruction from North Korea with a purpose of instigating university student rallies to stop the ongoing tuition hike in South Korea.\n\n==English education==\nKorea, which is considered the most difficult Asian nation of people to communicate with in English, has an extensive English education history dating back to the Joseon Dynasty. During this time,  Koreans received English education in public institutes, where translators were instructed for conversion of Korean into foreign languages. The Public Foreign Language School established in 1893, educated young males to perform tasks to modernize Korea. This school, unlike facilities such as Yuk Young Gong Won (1886), disregarded social statuses, welcoming more students into the institute and introducing the first Korean foreign language instructors into the field of English education (Chang, 2009).\n\nEnglish was also taught during the Joseon Dynasty in missionary schools, which were established to spread the word of the Christian faith to Koreans, although these schools did not equip its students with the necessary tools to read, write, comprehend and speak the language. Direct Method teaching was uncommon, as instructors were often unqualified as English teachers and the textbook was limited to the Holy Bible. During the Japanese Imperialism Period, Koreans were forced to prioritize the learning and speaking of Japanese. English was offered only as an elective course, though, the instructors were often Japanese, hindering proper English pronunciation. After the liberation of Korea from Japan in 1945, the first national curriculum was established in 1955, launching greater pursuit of English education and returning the nation to speaking its native tongue.\n\nThe relevance of early English education and globalization were brought to the attention of South Korea during the 1986 Asian Games and Seoul Olympic Games, as many came to realize the value of the English language. English is taught as a required subject from the third year of elementary school up to high school, as well as in most universities, with the goal of performing well on the [[TOEIC]] and [[TOEFL]], which are tests of reading, listening and grammar-based English.  For students who achieve high scores, there is also a speaking evaluation. Universities began lecturing in English to help improve competence and though only few were competent enough themselves to lead a class, many elementary school teachers were also recommended to teach in English.\n\nIn 1994, the university entrance examination moved away from testing grammar, towards a more communicative method. Parents redirected the focus of English education to align with exam content (Park, 2009). English Language Education programs focus on ensuring competency to perform effectively as a nation in an era of globalization using proficiency-based language programs that allow students to learn according to their own abilities and interests and driving Koreans to focus more on oral proficiency (Chang, 2009 & Park, 2009). With the new focus placed on oral expertise, there has been an \"intense desire to speak native-like English\" pressuring parents to take measures to ensure the most beneficial English education (Park, 2009).\n\nBecause of large class sizes and other factors in public schools, many parents pay to send their children to private English-language schools in the afternoon or evening. Families invest significant portions of household incomes on the education of children to include English camps and language training abroad. Usually different private English-language schools specialize in teaching elementary school students or in middle and high school students. The most ambitious parents send their children to kindergartens that utilize English exclusively in the classroom. Many children also live abroad for anywhere from a few months to several years to learn English. Sometimes, a Korean mother and her children will move to an English-speaking country for an extended period of time to enhance the children's English ability. In these cases, the father left in Korea is known as a [[gireogi appa]] (Korean: \uae30\ub7ec\uae30 \uc544\ube60), literally a \"goose dad\" who must migrate to see his family.<ref name=english>{{cite news |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/asia/08geese.html |title=For English Studies, Koreans Say Goodbye to Dad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nThere are more than 100,000 Korean students in the U.S. The increase of 10 percent every year helped Korea remain the top student-sending country in the U.S. for a second year, ahead of India and China. Korean students at Harvard University are the third most after Canadian and Chinese. In 2012, 154,000 South Korean students were pursuing degrees at overseas universities, with countries such as Japan, Canada, the United States, and Australia as top destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2013/08/south-korean-student-mobility-takes-a-dip/ |title=South Korean student mobility takes a dip |publisher=ICEF |accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKorean English classes focus on vocabulary, grammar, and reading. Academies tend to include conversation, and some offer debate and presentation.\n\nDue to recent curriculum changes, the education system in Korea is now placing a greater emphasis on English verbal abilities rather than grammatical skills. With influence from the government, English education began to focus on the communicative competence of Korean students emphasizing fluency and comprehension through listening materials. Universities require all first year students to take an English conversation class in their first year and some universities require students to take conversational English classes throughout the entirety of their university life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to a 2003 survey conducted by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, despite being one of the countries in Asia that spends the most money on English-language education, South Korea ranks the lowest among 12 Asian countries in English ability.<!-- dead link: [http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Asia/STIStory_205075.html straitstimes] -->\n\nEnglish as a subject discipline, that is, the study of linguistics, literature, composition/rhetoric, or pedagogy is uncommon except in top-tier or graduate programs in Korea. As a result, despite efforts to recruit foreign faculty in Korean universities, opportunities for tenure are fewer and professorial privileges and salaries are lower than for foreigners contracted to teach major disciplinary courses in English ([[content-based instruction]]). Overall, more native English speakers are being employed as educators in Korea to improve the English education process. Koreans have come to believe native English speakers are the best teachers of the language and to be proficient in the English language gives their children an advantage over others and is an \"educational investment that promises surplus\"(Han, 2007).\n\n==Controversy and criticism==\n\n===Students' health===\nSouth Korea's scarcity of natural resources is often cited as a reason for the rigorousness and fierce competition of its school systems; the academic pressure on its students is arguably the largest in the world. In an article entitled \"An Assault Upon Our Children,\" Se-Woong Koo wrote that \"the system's dark side casts a long shadow. Dominated by tiger moms, cram schools and highly authoritarian teachers, South Korean education produces ranks of overachieving students who pay a stiff price in health and happiness. The entire program amounts to child abuse. It should be reformed and restructured without delay.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/opinion/sunday/south-koreas-education-system-hurts-students.html |title=An Assault Upon Our Children |last=Koo |first=Se-Woong |work=The New York Times |date=1 August 2014}}</ref> In a response to the article, educator [[Diane Ravitch]] warned against modeling an educational system in which children \"exist either to glorify the family or to build the national economy.\" She argued furthermore that the happiness of South Korean children has been sacrificed, and likened the country's students to \"cogs in a national economic machine\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dianeravitch.net/2014/08/03/why-we-should-not-copy-education-in-south-korea/ |title=Why We Should Not Copy Education in South Korea |last=Ravitch |first=Diane |date=August 3, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref> A 2014 Lee Ju-ho, the Minister representing the '''Ministry of Education & Science Technology''', announced a plan on February 8, 2011 to dispatch un-hired reserve teachers overseas for extra training despite the opposition from the Korean Teachers Union and other public workers in the city-level and the provincial level.<ref>{{cite news |first=??
