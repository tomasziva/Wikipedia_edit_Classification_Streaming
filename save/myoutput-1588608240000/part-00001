Traditionally, technology has been so strong that it launched rockets with its own technology since the 1960s that it has churned out numerous homegrown venture entrepreneurs, starting with BitComputer, the No. 1 Korean venture firm. Bachelor degree is also very flexible overall, so it is a very good environment for students who want to learn various fields through minor or dual major.\nIt played a major role in the history of rocket development in South Korea, which was led by the government in the early days, but moved on to private research focusing on Inha University after political upheaval such as April Revolution(4.19 \ud601\uba85) and May 16 coup(5.16 \uad70\uc0ac\uc815\ubcc0). Inha University was a leading university in the development of rockets in Korea. It launched its own technology rockets, IITO-1A and IITO-2A in 1960, IITA-7CR in 1964, IITA-X21 in 1968 and IS-001 and IS-002 in 1988. The IITA-7CR, which was launched in 1964 to mark the 10th anniversary of its foundation, is still on display on campus. The Inha Roket Research Institute, a rocket research club currently active, is also Korea's first university student rocket club. These features and capabilities continue to be present and in 2018, the first Asian university to sign a space technology contract with NASA for joint research, joining NASA's deep space exploration project, the Helios Project. NASA's first research institute in Asia is set up in Korea, and Inha University has been selected as a joint research partner, becoming the first Asian university to sign a space technology contract with NASA for joint research. Under the agreement, NASA's Langley Research Center will work together on the Helios project, a project to develop a projectile for deep space exploration under way To that end, an aerospace campus is under construction in Songdo and the Inha IST-NASA Joint Research Center for deep space exploration will be set up, which will involve Inha University and NASA's Langley Research Center.\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n=== Attached agencies ===\nInha university has 8 attached [[agency (law)|agencies]] which are listed below:\n\n* Jung-Seok Memorial Library\n* Language Training Center\n* Center for Continuing Education\n* Inha Museum\n* Teachers Training Center\n* Infirmary\n* Jungseok Research Institute of International Logistics and Trade\n* Christian Missionaries working to convert non-religious and other religious people to Christians\n\n=== Research institutes ===\nInha university has about 60 research institutes attached to it.<ref>http://www.inha.ac.kr/mbshome/mbs/eng/subview.do?id=eng_040103000000</ref> These institutes are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On March 14, 1958, the establishment of a graduate school was approved.\n\nFinancial resources for the foundation came from the proceeds of the sale of the [[Korean Christian Institute]],<ref>http://www.kinderinkorea.com/kcu.htm</ref> an organization founded and managed by Dr. Rhee for the purpose of educating the children of the original emigrants, donations from Korean emigrants in Hawaii and domestic supporters, and a government subsidy. Along with school site donation from [[Incheon city]], the Ministry of Culture and Education approved the foundation of the Inha Institute in February, 1954.\n\nInstitute building construction began in earnest, to finally have the [[Inha Institute of Technology]] opened later the same year, in the scheme of the parent 6 Departments of Metallurgical, Mechanical, Mining, Electric, Shipbuilding and Chemical Engineering.<ref>http://eng.inha.ac.kr/intro/history_50.asp</ref>\n\n=== Time of expansion and development ===\nThe Inha Institute of Technology, with its unique history and great mission to foster excellent students who would contribute to the development of the nation's scientific and technological industries, was funded to do so by the help of huge government subsidies and foreign aid from UNESCO and the German government.\n\nIn a move to improve the management of the Inha Institute, the Board of Trustees was reorganized and Dr. Choong-Hoon Jo and Dr. Jwa-Kyung Seong assumed the positions of Chairman of the Board and the Dean, respectively. That change brought more energy to the management, and resulted in the introduction of state-of-the-art experimental and research equipment, construction of new school buildings, research centers, practice factories, experimental tanks, library, and gymnasium, and secured excellent professors, contributing to the development of the Korean industry.\nWith the rapid development of the Inha Institute of Technology, its size and facilities surpassed those of other colleges.\n\nIt was inevitable for the institute to be elevated to the status of university, thus in December, 1971, the Ministry of Culture and Education approved the elevation and Dr. Jwa-Kyung Seong took office as the first president, solidifying the basis toward one of the prestigious universities in Korea.\n\nUltimately on Oct. 2, 2014, in collaboration between Inha University and the Government of Uzbekistan, [[Inha University in Tashkent]], the first South Korean university abroad, has been established, with a view to training professional global IT leaders in the country.\nThe curriculum and academic program of this newly emerging international university comprise the same as those of Inha University in Korea.\n\n== Vision ==\nToday, Inha University fosters professionals with academic skills and a character befitting the school motto of Truth. Inha has already produced as many as 120,000 [[graduates]] in science, technology and industry. Inha currently educates 20,000 students, while continuing efforts to become one of the top universities in the world. In 2014, Inha University has started to grow at an international level with the opening<ref>http://www.inha.uz/</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pv.uz/obrazovanie/17087 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703131903/http://pv.uz/obrazovanie/17087 |archive-date=2015-07-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of the [[Inha University in Tashkent]] in the city of [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Traditionally, technology has been so strong that it launched rockets with its own technology since the 1960s that it has churned out numerous homegrown venture entrepreneurs, starting with BitComputer, the No. 1 Korean venture firm. Bachelor degree is also very flexible overall, so it is a very good environment for students who want to learn various fields through minor or dual major.\nIt played a major role in the history of rocket development in South Korea, which was led by the government in the early days, but moved on to private research focusing on Inha University after political upheaval such as April Revolution(4.19 \ud601\uba85) and May 16 coup(5.16 \uad70\uc0ac\uc815\ubcc0). Inha University was a leading university in the development of rockets in Korea. It launched its own technology rockets, IITO-1A and IITO-2A in 1960, IITA-7CR in 1964, IITA-X21 in 1968 and IS-001 and IS-002 in 1988. The IITA-7CR, which was launched in 1964 to mark the 10th anniversary of its foundation, is still on display on campus. The Inha Roket Research Institute, a rocket research club currently active, is also Korea's first university student rocket club. These features and capabilities continue to be present and in 2018, the first Asian university to sign a space technology contract with NASA for joint research, joining NASA's deep space exploration project, the Helios Project. NASA's first research institute in Asia is set up in Korea, and Inha University has been selected as a joint research partner, becoming the first Asian university to sign a space technology contract with NASA for joint research. Under the agreement, NASA's Langley Research Center will work together on the Helios project, a project to develop a projectile for deep space exploration under way To that end, an aerospace campus is under construction in Songdo and the Inha IST-NASA Joint Research Center for deep space exploration will be set up, which will involve Inha University and NASA's Langley Research Center.\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n=== Attached agencies ===\nInha university has 8 attached [[agency (law)|agencies]] which are listed below:\n\n* Jung-Seok Memorial Library\n* Language Training Center\n* Center for Continuing Education\n* Inha Museum\n* Teachers Training Center\n* Infirmary\n* Jungseok Research Institute of International Logistics and Trade\n* Christian Missionaries working to convert non-religious and other religious people to Christians\n\n=== Research institutes ===\nInha university has about 60 research institutes attached to it.<ref>http://www.inha.ac.kr/mbshome/mbs/eng/subview.do?id=eng_040103000000</ref> These institutes are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
