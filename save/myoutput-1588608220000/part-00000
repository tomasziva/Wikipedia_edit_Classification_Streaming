The grandiose ensemble of the Hall and its adjoining salons was intended to illustrate the power of the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] monarch [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Located on the ground floor of the palace's central body, it faces west towards the [[Gardens of Versailles|Palace Gardens]] for a complete perspective. The Hall of Mirrors has been the scene of events of great historic significance on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Sinclair2011\">{{cite book|author=David Sinclair|title=Hall Of Mirrors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LYuO6cMjPXgC&pg=PT1|date=31 July 2011| publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4464-7356-6|pages=1\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Boyle2008\">{{cite book|author=Nicholas Boyle|title=German Literature: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhkGgF2GmlMC&pg=PA16|date=28 February 2008|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-157863-2|pages=16\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:The Queen\u2019s and King\u2019s apartments at the Hall of Mirrors.jpg|thumb|The royal apartments adjacent to the Hall of Mirrors]]\nIn 1623 [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] ordered the construction of a modest two-story hunting lodge at Versailles, which he soon enlarged to a ch\u00e2teau from 1631 to 1634. His son [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] declared the site his future permanent residence in 1661 and ordered the transformation into an extensive residence in several stages and on a grandiose scale. The palace was to provide ideal settings for rest and retreat but it also had to attain a new quality of representation as the future seat of Europe's greatest [[Absolute Monarchy|absolutist]] royal court and government of supreme authority, residence of choice for the aristocratic society and arena for elaborate state festivals and ceremonies, Europe's centre of culture, art and entertainment. During the early expansion phase [[Louis Le Vau]] added the Forecourt (1662) and the \u201cLe Vau Envelope\u201d (1668 to 1670), encased the old ch\u00e2teau and added two new wings in the north and south. The new wings towered over the original western building by the garden. The space in between was a terrace supported by arcades. The buildings of the \u201cLe Vau Envelope\u201d included the king's apartments in the north and the queen's apartments in the south.<ref name=\"Enc\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palace-of-Versailles|title=Palace of Versailles {{!}} palace, Versailles, France|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=May 3, 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Hall of Mirrors was built during the third building stage between 1678 and 1684 and was to replace the large terrace, that opened towards the garden. The terrace was originally situated directly outside of the [[Appartement du roi|King\u2019s and the Queen\u2019s apartments]]. The terrace was, after all, considered to be a rather misplaced architectural element and exposed to the elements, that reduced its utility. Eventually it was decided to demolish it and architect [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] was tasked with the design development and the construction of the Mirror Hall Gallery and artist [[Charles Le Brun]] received the honor to create the interior decorative apparatus.<ref name=\"Banham1997\">{{Cite book |last=Joanna Banham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlKhCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT730 |title=Encyclopedia of Interior Design |date=May 1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-78758-4 |pages=730\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=La galerie des Glaces |url=https://www.versailles-tourisme.com/la-galerie-des-glaces.html |publisher=Versailles Tourisme |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe garden facade of the [[Corps de logis]] was built in a straight front and essentially received its current appearance. The Hall of Mirrors is flanked at the far ends by the Salon of War (Salon de la guerre) in the north and the Salon of Peace (Salon de la paix) in the south, respectively. The Mirror Gallery connects to the two Salons, which were assigned to and incorporated into the king's apartments in the north and the queen's apartments in the south. Both Salons are accessible via the Mirror Gallery through wide opening passageways. The Hall and the two Salons were identically furnished and decorated and form a stylistic and functional unit. The exterior walls of the Salons date from the time of Le Vau's encasings of the old ch\u00e2teau and were given their current appearance after the installation of the Mirror Hall by Hardouin-Mansart.<ref name=\"wes\">{{Cite web |title=Palace of Versailles - The Hall of Mirrors |url=http://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/estate/palace/hall-mirrors |publisher=Chateau Versailles |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Mansart and le Brun in the Genesis of the Grande Galerie de Versailles |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043079.1940.11409005 |publisher=Informa UK Limited |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hall of Mirrors is besides the [[Chapels of Versailles|Palace Chapel]], completed in the early 18th century, the [[Royal Opera of Versailles|Court Opera]] and the [[Galerie des Batailles]] one of the largest rooms in the palace.

On the opposite inside wall of the Hall are 17 equally large mirrors, that are composed of more than 350 individual mirror surfaces. On the one hand, the mirrors had an aesthetic function, as the mirror image of the garden depicted the exterior of the castle into the interior of the building and reflected the candlelight in the evening. On the other hand, the mirrors also conveyed the king's wealth and the efficiency of the French economy in a subtle way. Mirror glass was an expensive luxury product in the 17th century and could only be produced with great effort. The manufacture of the mirror surfaces was the first major order for a glass factory founded by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the later Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, with which the Venetian monopoly in the area was broken.  Many of the other attributes of the Hall of Mirrors were lost to war for financial purposes, such as the silver table pieces and [[Gu\u00e9ridon|''gu\u00e9ridons,'']] which were melted by order of Louis XIV in 1689 to finance the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]].\n\n== Construction ==\n\n[[Image:Versailleshallofmirrors.jpg|thumb|upright|Gilded sculptured ''gu\u00e9ridons'' were commissioned to replace part of the silver furniture melted in 1689 to finance the War of the League of Augsburg.]]\n\nIn the 17th century,  [[mirror]]s were among the most expensive items to possess at the time; the [[Venetian Republic]] held the monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors. In order to maintain the integrity of his philosophy of [[mercantilism]], which required that all items used in the decoration of Versailles be made in France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] enticed several workers from Venice to make mirrors at the [[Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs]]. According to legend, in order to keep its monopoly, the government of the Venetian Republic sent agents to France to poison the workers whom Colbert had brought to France.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973760802442756   |title= Mirrors of Society: Versailles and the Use of Flat Reflected Images | publisher= Informa UK Limited | date=September 25, 2009  | author=Felipe Chaimovich   | accessdate= May 3, 2020  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118314234.ch26   |title= Seventeenth\u2013Century Varec Glass from the Great Hall of Mirrors at Versailles | publisher= John Wiley & Sons | date=January 21, 2013  | author=B.

Construction on the ''galerie'' and its two salons continued until 1684, at which time it was pressed into use for court and state functions. The ceiling decoration is dedicated to the political policies and military victories of Louis XIV. The central panel of the ceiling, ''Le roi gouverne par lui-m\u00eame'' (\"The king governs alone\"), alludes to the establishment of the personal reign of Louis XIV in 1661. The present decorative schema represents the last of three that were presented to Louis XIV. The original decorative plan was to have depicted the exploits of [[Apollo]], being consistent with the imagery associated with the Sun-King, Louis XIV. However, when the king learned that his brother, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], had commissioned [[Pierre Mignard]] to decorate the ceiling of the ''grande galerie'' of his brother's residence at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]], Louis XIV rejected the plan. The next decorative plan was one in which the exploits of [[Hercules]] \u2014 as allegories to the actions of Louis XIV \u2014 were to be depicted. Again, as with the first plan, the Hercules theme was rejected by the king. The final plan represents military victories of Louis XIV starting with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) to the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]] (1678\u20131679). In a departure from the decoration of the ceilings in the ''grand appartement du roi'', Le Brun has depicted Louis XIV directly, and has ceased to refer to the king in allegorical guises. In this way, themes such as good governance and military prowess are rendered with Louis XIV himself as the key figure.><ref name=\"Montague-1992\">Jenifer Montagu, \"Le Brun's Early Designs for the Grand Galerie: some comments on the drawings\".

Embassies, births, and marriages were f\u00eated in this room; however, perhaps the most celebrated event of the 18th century occurred on 25 February 1745: the celebrated ''bal des Ifs'' (Ball of the Yew Trees). It was during this costume ball that Louis XV, who was dressed as a [[taxus|yew]] tree, met Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson d'\u00c9tiolles, who was costumed as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], goddess of the hunt.

Located on the ground floor of the palace's central body, it faces west towards the [[Gardens of Versailles|Palace Gardens]] for a complete perspective.

His son [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] declared the site his future permanent residence in 1661 and ordered the transformation into an extensive residence in several stages and on a grandiose scale. The palace was to provide ideal settings for rest and retreat but it also had to attain a new quality of representation as the future seat of Europe's greatest [[Absolute Monarchy|absolutist]] royal court and government of supreme authority, residence of choice for the aristocratic society and arena for elaborate state festivals and ceremonies, Europe's centre of culture, art and entertainment. During the early expansion phase [[Louis Le Vau]] added the Forecourt (1662) and the \u201cLe Vau Envelope\u201d (1668 to 1670), encased the old ch\u00e2teau and added two new wings in the north and south. The new wings towered over the original western building by the garden. The space in between was a terrace supported by arcades. The buildings of the \u201cLe Vau Envelope\u201d included the king's apartments in the north and the queen's apartments in the south.<ref name=\"Enc\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palace-of-Versailles|title=Palace of Versailles {{!}} palace, Versailles, France|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=May 3, 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Hall of Mirrors was built during the third building stage between 1678 and 1684 and was to replace the large terrace, that opened towards the garden. The terrace was originally situated directly outside of the [[Appartement du roi|King\u2019s and the Queen\u2019s apartments]]. The terrace was, after all, considered to be a rather misplaced architectural element and exposed to the elements, that reduced its utility. Eventually it was decided to demolish it and architect [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] was tasked with the design development and the construction of the Mirror Hall Gallery and artist [[Charles Le Brun]] received the honor to create the interior decorative apparatus.<ref name=\"Banham1997\">{{Cite book |last=Joanna Banham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlKhCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT730 |title=Encyclopedia of Interior Design |date=May 1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-78758-4 |pages=730\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=La galerie des Glaces |url=https://www.versailles-tourisme.com/la-galerie-des-glaces.html |publisher=Versailles Tourisme |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe garden facade of the [[Corps de logis]] was built in a straight front and essentially received its current appearance. The Hall of Mirrors is flanked at the far ends by the Salon of War (Salon de la guerre) in the north and the Salon of Peace (Salon de la paix) in the south, respectively. The Mirror Gallery connects to the two Salons, which were assigned to and incorporated into the king's apartments in the north and the queen's apartments in the south. Both Salons are accessible via the Mirror Gallery through wide opening passageways. The Hall and the two Salons were identically furnished and decorated and form a stylistic and functional unit. The exterior walls of the Salons date from the time of Le Vau's encasings of the old ch\u00e2teau and were given their current appearance after the installation of the Mirror Hall by Hardouin-Mansart.<ref name=\"wes\">{{Cite web |title=Palace of Versailles - The Hall of Mirrors |url=http://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/estate/palace/hall-mirrors |publisher=Chateau Versailles |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Mansart and le Brun in the Genesis of the Grande Galerie de Versailles |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043079.1940.11409005 |publisher=Informa UK Limited |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hall of Mirrors is besides the [[Chapels of Versailles|Palace Chapel]], completed in the early 18th century, the [[Royal Opera of Versailles|Court Opera]] and the [[Galerie des Batailles]] one of the largest rooms in the palace.

Each arch contains twenty-one mirrors. The entire Galerie des glaces contains 357 mirrors in total. The arches themselves are fixed between marble pilasters whose capitals depict the symbols of France. These gilded bronze capitals include the fleur-de-lys and the Gallic cockerel or rooster. Many of the other attributes of the Hall of Mirrors were lost to war for financial purposes, such as the silver table pieces and [[Gu\u00e9ridon|''gu\u00e9ridons,'']] which were melted by order of Louis XIV in 1689 to finance the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]].\n\n== Construction ==\n\n[[Image:Versailleshallofmirrors.jpg|thumb|upright|Gilded sculptured ''gu\u00e9ridons'' were commissioned to replace part of the silver furniture melted in 1689 to finance the War of the League of Augsburg.]]\n\nIn the 17th century,  [[mirror]]s were among the most expensive items to possess at the time; the [[Venetian Republic]] held the monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors. In order to maintain the integrity of his philosophy of [[mercantilism]], which required that all items used in the decoration of Versailles be made in France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] enticed several workers from Venice to make mirrors at the [[Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs]]. According to legend, in order to keep its monopoly, the government of the Venetian Republic sent agents to France to poison the workers whom Colbert had brought to France.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973760802442756   |title= Mirrors of Society: Versailles and the Use of Flat Reflected Images | publisher= Informa UK Limited | date=September 25, 2009  | author=Felipe Chaimovich   | accessdate= May 3, 2020  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118314234.ch26   |title= Seventeenth\u2013Century Varec Glass from the Great Hall of Mirrors at Versailles | publisher= John Wiley & Sons | date=January 21, 2013  | author=B.

Construction on the ''galerie'' and its two salons continued until 1684, at which time it was pressed into use for court and state functions. The ceiling decoration is dedicated to the political policies and military victories of Louis XIV. The central panel of the ceiling, ''Le roi gouverne par lui-m\u00eame'' (\"The king governs alone\"), alludes to the establishment of the personal reign of Louis XIV in 1661. The present decorative schema represents the last of three that were presented to Louis XIV. The original decorative plan was to have depicted the exploits of [[Apollo]], being consistent with the imagery associated with the Sun-King, Louis XIV. However, when the king learned that his brother, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], had commissioned [[Pierre Mignard]] to decorate the ceiling of the ''grande galerie'' of his brother's residence at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud]], Louis XIV rejected the plan. The next decorative plan was one in which the exploits of [[Hercules]] \u2014 as allegories to the actions of Louis XIV \u2014 were to be depicted. Again, as with the first plan, the Hercules theme was rejected by the king. The final plan represents military victories of Louis XIV starting with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) to the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]] (1678\u20131679). In a departure from the decoration of the ceilings in the ''grand appartement du roi'', Le Brun has depicted Louis XIV directly, and has ceased to refer to the king in allegorical guises. In this way, themes such as good governance and military prowess are rendered with Louis XIV himself as the key figure.><ref name=\"Montague-1992\">Jenifer Montagu, \"Le Brun's Early Designs for the Grand Galerie: some comments on the drawings\".
