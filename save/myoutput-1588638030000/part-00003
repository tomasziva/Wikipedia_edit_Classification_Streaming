Osbourne later became a talent show competition judge on television shows such as ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' (2004-2007, 2013-2017) and ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' (2007-2012).\n\nOsbourne is credited with reviving her husband's [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] career by founding the summer [[Ozzfest]] tour.<ref name=\"interview:Eminemsings\">{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,3605,495951,00.html|title= Eminem sings about killing his wife.

Since 2011, Osbourne has been a co-host on the daytime series ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]''. Osbourne is one of the original hosts from its launch in October 2010. In September 2014, it was announced that she would become an occasional panellist on the British television programme ''[[Loose Women]]'' as part of the show's relaunch. On both shows, Osbourne and co-hosts/panellists discuss topical issues, ranging from daily politics and current affairs, to celebrity gossip. \n\nOsbourne has also established herself in the publishing industry, releasing three autobiographies and one novel. Her first autobiography book, ''Extreme,'' went to number one on the ''Sunday Times Bestseller List'' (UK) where it remained for 15 weeks and sold over 621,000 copies in hardback, becoming the biggest-selling autobiography since British records began.

The show began airing in early 2002, and when, in July 2002, Osbourne was diagnosed with cancer, she insisted that filming should continue. The final episode of the show aired in the US on 21 March 2005. MTV's British affiliate has been airing the show since 2003.

The show began airing in early 2002, and when, in July 2002, Osbourne was diagnosed with cancer, she insisted that filming should continue. The final episode of the show aired in the US on 21 March 2005. MTV's British affiliate has been airing the show since 2003.
