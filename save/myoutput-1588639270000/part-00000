The song also states that the comedian Lenny Bruce was to make a camp appearance. Sherman wants to stay, loving Granada for several things including the poker games. this time, Sherman is taking care of his younger brother, who is immature. the younger brother gets up early each morning to go to the Quicksand, (toilet). the final line states that he was homesick, but that he got over it, and that he's like all of the other boys \"Except his bed is wetter\". Sherman wrote a third version for, and acted in, a 1965 TV commercial for a board game about [[Camp Granada]], a \"real rotten camp\".<ref name=LikeTelevision>{{cite web | url = http://tesla.liketelevision.com/liketelevision/tuner.php?channel=578&format=tv&theme=toyland | title = LikeTelevision - Camp Granada by Milton Bradley| work=liketelevision ...only better|accessdate = 2008-02-09| date =  | publisher = LikeTelevision}}</ref>  The original version also reached #9 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Pop-Standard Singles chart]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20131993 |publisher= Record Research |page=217}}</ref>\nThe song hit number one in Hong Kong, which does not have any summer camps.\nThe song won the [[Grammy Awards of 1964#Comedy|1964 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1964-216.html |title=Grammy Award Nominees 1964 \u2013 Grammy Award Winners 1964 |last=|first=|date=|website=Awardsandshows.com |accessdate=10 August 2019 }}</ref>  It was played frequently on the ''[[Dr. Demento]] Show'' and is featured on the [[Rhino Records]] compilation album, ''Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection''.
