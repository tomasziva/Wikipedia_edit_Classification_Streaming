Fused silica can be made from almost any [[silicon]]-rich chemical precursor, usually using a continuous process which involves flame [[oxidation]] of volatile silicon compounds to silicon dioxide, and thermal fusion of the resulting dust (although alternative processes are used). This results in a transparent glass with an ultra-high purity and improved optical transmission in the deep ultraviolet. One common method involves adding [[silicon tetrachloride]] to a hydrogen\u2013oxygen flame, but this precursor results in environmentally unfriendly byproducts{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} including [[chlorine]] and [[hydrochloric acid]].\n\n==Product quality==\n\nFused quartz is normally transparent.  The material can, however, become translucent if small air bubbles are allowed to be trapped within.  The water content (and therefore infrared transmission of fused quartz and fused silica) is determined by the manufacturing process. Flame-fused material always has a higher water content due to the combination of the hydrocarbons and oxygen fuelling the furnace, forming [[hydroxyl]] [OH] groups within the material. An IR grade material typically has an [OH] content  below 10 ppm.\n\n==Applications==\nMost of the applications of fused silica exploit its wide transparency range, which extends from the UV to the near IR. Fused silica is the key starting material for [[optical fiber]], used for telecommunications.\n\nBecause of its strength and high melting point (compared to ordinary [[glass]]), fused silica is used as an envelope for [[halogen lamp]]s and [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s, which must operate at a high envelope temperature to achieve their combination of high brightness and long life. Vacuum tubes with silica envelopes allowed for [[radiation cooling]] by incandescent anodes.\n\nBecause of its strength, fused silica was used in deep diving vessels such as the [[bathysphere]] and [[benthoscope]]. Fused silica is also used to form the windows of manned spacecraft, including the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1120&context=nasapub&sei-redir=1|title=Transparent Armor Ceramics as Spacecraft Windows|last=Salem|first=Jonathan|date=2012|website=Journal of the [[American Ceramic Society]]}}</ref>\n\nThe combination of strength, thermal stability, and UV transparency makes it an excellent substrate for projection masks for [[photolithography]].\n\n[[File:EPROM Intel C1702A.jpg|thumb|An [[EPROM]] with fused quartz window in the top of the package]]\nIts UV transparency also finds uses in the semiconductor industry; an [[EPROM]], or erasable programmable [[read only memory]], is a type of memory [[integrated circuit|chip]] that retains its data when its power supply is switched off, but which can be erased by exposure to strong ultraviolet light. EPROMs are recognizable by the transparent fused quartz window which sits on top of the package, through which the [[silicon]] chip is visible, and which permits exposure to [[UV light]] during erasing.\n\nDue to the thermal stability and composition, it is used in semiconductor fabrication furnaces.\n\nFused quartz has nearly ideal properties for fabricating [[first surface mirror]]s such as those used in [[telescope]]s.  The material behaves in a predictable way and allows the optical fabricator to put a very smooth polish onto the surface and produce the desired figure with fewer testing iterations. In some instances, a high-purity UV grade of fused quartz has been used to make several of the individual uncoated lens elements of special-purpose lenses including the Zeiss 105&#8239;mm&#8239;f/4.3&#8239;UV&#8239;Sonnar, a lens formerly made for the Hasselblad camera, and the Nikon UV-Nikkor 105&#8239;mm&#8239;f/4.5 (presently sold{{clarify|reason=this lens is no longer manufactured by Nikon|date=May 2014}} as the Nikon PF10545MF-UV) lens. These lenses are used for UV photography, as the quartz glass has a lower extinction rate than lenses made with more common [[Flint glass|flint]] or [[Crown glass (optics)|crown]] glass formulas.\n\nFused quartz can be metallised and etched for use as a substrate for high-precision microwave circuits, the thermal stability making it a good choice for narrowband filters and similar demanding applications. The lower [[dielectric constant]] than alumina allows higher impedance tracks or thinner substrates.\n\nFused quartz is also the material used for modern glass instruments such as the [[glass harp]] and the [[verrophone]], and is also used for new builds of the historical [[glass harmonica]]. Here, the superior strength and structure of fused quartz gives it a greater dynamic range and a clearer sound than the historically used [[lead crystal]].\n\n===Refractory material applications===\nFused silica as an industrial raw material is used to make various refractory shapes such as crucibles, trays, shrouds, and rollers for many high-temperature thermal processes including [[steelmaking]], [[investment casting]], and glass manufacture.  Refractory shapes made from fused silica have excellent thermal shock resistance and are chemically inert to most elements and compounds, including virtually all acids, regardless of concentration, except [[hydrofluoric acid]], which is very reactive even in fairly low concentrations.

The cost of production is significantly higher, limiting its use; it is usually found as a single basic element, such as a tube in a furnace, or as a flask, the elements in direct exposure to the heat.\n\n==Physical properties==\nThe extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, about 5.5&#8239;\u22c5&#8239;10<sup>\u22127</sup>/K (20...320&nbsp;\u00b0C), accounts for its remarkable ability to undergo large, rapid temperature changes without cracking (see [[thermal shock]]).\n\n[[File:Fused silica phosphorescence from a 24 million watt flash.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Phosphorescence in fused quartz from an extremely intense pulse of UV light in a flashtube, centered at 170 nm]]\nFused quartz is prone to [[phosphorescence]] and \"[[solarisation (physics)|solarisation]]\" (purplish discoloration) under intense UV illumination, as is often seen in [[flashtube]]s. \"UV grade\" synthetic fused silica (sold under various tradenames including \"HPFS\", \"Spectrosil\", and \"Suprasil\") has a very low metallic impurity content making it transparent deeper into the ultraviolet. An optic with a thickness of 1&nbsp;cm has a transmittance around 50% at a [[wavelength]] of 170&nbsp;nm, which drops to only a few percent at 160&nbsp;nm. However, its infrared transmission is limited by strong [[water absorption]]s at 2.2 \u03bcm and 2.7 \u03bcm.\n\n\"Infrared grade\" fused quartz (tradenames \"Infrasil\", \"Vitreosil IR\", and others), which is electrically fused, has a greater presence of metallic impurities, limiting its UV transmittance wavelength to around 250&nbsp;nm, but a much lower water content, leading to excellent infrared transmission up to 3.6 \u03bcm wavelength.

The cost of production is significantly higher, limiting its use; it is usually found as a single basic element, such as a tube in a furnace, or as a flask, the elements in direct exposure to the heat.\n\n==Physical properties==\nThe extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, about 5.5&#8239;\u22c5&#8239;10<sup>\u22127</sup>/K (20...320&nbsp;\u00b0C), accounts for its remarkable ability to undergo large, rapid temperature changes without cracking (see [[thermal shock]]).\n\n[[File:Fused silica phosphorescence from a 24 million watt flash.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Phosphorescence in fused quartz from an extremely intense pulse of UV light in a flashtube, centered at 170 nm]]\nFused quartz is prone to [[phosphorescence]] and \"[[solarisation (physics)|solarisation]]\" (purplish discoloration) under intense UV illumination, as is often seen in [[flashtube]]s. \"UV grade\" synthetic fused silica (sold under various tradenames including \"HPFS\", \"Spectrosil\", and \"Suprasil\") has a very low metallic impurity content making it transparent deeper into the ultraviolet. An optic with a thickness of 1&nbsp;cm has a transmittance around 50% at a [[wavelength]] of 170&nbsp;nm, which drops to only a few percent at 160&nbsp;nm. However, its infrared transmission is limited by strong [[water absorption]]s at 2.2 \u03bcm and 2.7 \u03bcm.\n\n\"Infrared grade\" fused quartz (tradenames \"Infrasil\", \"Vitreosil IR\", and others), which is electrically fused, has a greater presence of metallic impurities, limiting its UV transmittance wavelength to around 250&nbsp;nm, but a much lower water content, leading to excellent infrared transmission up to 3.6 \u03bcm wavelength. All grades of transparent fused quartz/fused silica have nearly identical physical properties.\n\n[[Image:Microflash-quartz-phosphorescence.jpg|thumb|250px| Phosphorescence of the quartz ignition tube of an [[air-gap flash]]]]\n\n==Optical properties==\nThe [[Dispersion (optics)|optical dispersion]] of fused silica can be approximated by the following [[Sellmeier equation]]:<ref name=m>{{cite journal|last1=Malitson|first1=I.
