Brown, alongside frequent collaborator [[Teddy Riley]], is noted as a pioneer of [[new jack swing]]; a fusion of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Brown started his career in the R&B and pop group [[New Edition]], from its inception in 1981<ref name=\"Story\"/> until his exit from the group in December 1985.<ref name=\"Left\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/arts/music/14brow.html|title=The Newest New Edition: Three Singers, Trading Styles With Equanimity|date=2009-02-13|accessdate=2019-10-29}}</ref> \n\nStarting a solo career, Brown enjoyed commercial and critical success with his second album ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]'' (1988) which spawned five [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 10 singles including the number one hit \"[[My Prerogative]]\", and the [[Grammy Award]]-winning \"[[Every Little Step]]\".<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/bobby-brown/chart-history/HSI|title=Bobby Brown Chart History|last=|first=|date=|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]''. In 1992, Brown married singer [[Whitney Houston]], with whom he had a daughter named [[Bobbi Kristina Brown]]. The couple's [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]] and [[Domestic violence|domestic disputes]] made them tabloid fodder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/music/celebrity/inside-whitney-houston-and-bobby-browns-rocky-marriage-it-was-more-of-a-codependency/ar-AAAdL0t|title=Inside Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's Rocky Marriage: 'It Was More of a Codependency'|last=Rubenstein|first=Janine|date=July 17, 2018|website=MSN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> \n\nBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' (1992) spawned several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]],\" and \"Good Enough.\" However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.\n\nBrown also starred in films such as ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'' and ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]''. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005. Brown and Houston starred in the 2005 reality show ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', and divorced two years later in 2007.\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]],<ref name=allmusic /> as one of eight children of Carole Elizabeth (born Williams), a substitute teacher, and Herbert James Brown, a construction worker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/boston/roxbury/articles/2011/02/02/whitney_houston_shows_for_funeral_in_roxbury/|title=Whitney Houston shows for funeral in Roxbury|work=[[Boston.com]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bobby-browns-uneasy-passage-19890907|title=Bobby Brown's Uneasy Passage|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref> Brown grew up in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]]'s [[Orchard Park Projects]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/more_names/blog/2009/09/from_boy_band_to_bloated_bobby.html|title=From boy band to bloated: Bobby Brown|work=Boston.com|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/bobby-brown-unhurt-gunman-slays-pal-article-1.693986|title=BOBBY BROWN UNHURT AS GUNMAN SLAYS PAL|work=[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/sep/29/singer-bobby-brown-uninjured-after-shootout-which/|title=Singer Bobby Brown Uninjured After Shootout Which Killed Friend Brown Was Leaving Seedy Bar Near His Boyhood Neighborhood - Spokesman.com - Sept. 29, 1995|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref> Brown's first taste of being onstage occurred when he was three and one of his childhood idols, [[James Brown]], performed in Boston. This performance sparked a dream of becoming a singer. Brown joined the church choir, where he recognized and developed his singing abilities. Brown's musical influences also include [[Rick James]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Marvin Gaye]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/bobby-brown/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy|title=Artist Influences for Bobby Brown|publisher=MTV.com|accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> \n\n==Music career==\n\n===New Edition===\n{{Main|New Edition}}\nNew Edition was founded in 1981 by 12-year-old Brown and childhood friends [[Michael Bivins]] and Ricky Bell.<ref name=\"Jet\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq|title=Jet|publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]]|issn=0021-5996|date=1997-12-08|accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref> [[Ralph Tresvant]] joined the group at the suggestion of Bell who sang with Tresvant as a duo. Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]], to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album ''[[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]''. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their [[New Edition|self-titled second release]]. The album included the crossover hits \"[[Cool It Now]]\" and \"[[Mr. Telephone Man]],\" which Brown also co-led.\n\nDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= How Cruel Can Fame Be, Bobby Brown? |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-63_1_bobby-brown|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Robert|last=Hilburn}}</ref> Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a [[VH-1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision.\n\n===Solo career===\nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album ''[[King of Stage]]'' in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"[[Girlfriend (Bobby Brown song)|Girlfriend]],\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well.\n\nBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Teddy Riley]]. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name=\":9\" /> including the number-one single, the self-penned \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which became, along with \"[[Every Little Step]]\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bobby-brown|title=Bobby Brown|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ''Don't Be Cruel'' also garnered Brown two [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]].\n\nIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, ''[[Dance!...Ya Know It!]]'', was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the ''Don't Be Cruel'' project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/bobby-browns-cruel-beguiles-fans-but-not-the-cop-who-nabbed-him-for-dirty-dancing-vol-31-no-14/|title=Bobby Brown's Cruel Beguiles Fans\u2014but Not the Cop Who Nabbed Him for Dirty Dancing|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|last2=Holmstrom|first2=Rick|date=April 10, 1989|website=People.com|language=EN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 [[MTV Awards]], and Brown was set to release the album ''Mystical Magic'', but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day. In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" by [[Glenn Medeiros]], making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend [[Ralph Tresvant]] on the latter's single \"[[Stone Cold Gentleman]]\", which was a top-five R&B hit.\n\nBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]],\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> He received his third [[American Music Award]] in January 1993. However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to [[Whitney Houston]], and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"[[Something in Common]],\" which was released as a single from the ''Bobby'' album.  Four years later he would release his fourth solo album ''[[Forever (Bobby Brown album)|Forever]]'', in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.\n\nPrior to the release of ''Forever'', Brown had been in negotiations with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label [[Death Row East]]. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following ''Forever'', Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from ''[[The Benzino Project]]'', and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper [[Ja Rule]] on the song \"[[Thug Lovin']].\" Brown was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]], but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to [[Damian Marley]]'s song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, ''[[Welcome to Jamrock]]''. \n\nIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled ''Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But'', written by author Derrick Handspike.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/author-reveals-why-bobby-brown-backed-ou/|title=Author Reveals Why Bobby Brown Backed Out of Tell-All Book Deal|last=|first=|date=December 16, 2009|website=Essence|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584747/bobby-browns-autobiography-claims-whitney-houston-introduced-him-to-hard-drugs/|title=Bobby Brown's Autobiography Claims Whitney Houston Introduced Him To Hard Drugs|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=April 3, 2008|website=MTV|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But|last=Handspike|first=Derrick|publisher=Over The Edge Books|year=2012|isbn=9781467519441|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer [[Macy Gray]] on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album ''[[The Sellout (album)|The Sellout]]''.

However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.\n\nIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death of the group's idol Michael Jackson]], all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of [[Jackson 5]] hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year. As of 2016, Brown and New Edition continue to perform together.\n\n==Film and television career==\n[[File:Vernae Taylor (left) Bobby Brown and Katrina Robinson.jpg|thumb|right|Brown with performing artist Vernae Taylor (left) and Katrina Robinson (right), at the Circle of Sisters event in 2018.]]\nBrown made his acting debut with a cameo appearance in the 1989 film, ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', playing the Mayor's doorman. The following year, he appeared in the HBO kids show, ''[[Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme]]'' playing all three characters of Three Blind Mice. In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', and had a major role in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film, ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]'', ''[[Gang of Roses]]'', ''[[Nora's Hair Salon]]'' and ''Go for Broke''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown signed a deal with [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] to overlook the direction of the reality series, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', but it was said{{by whom|date=June 2018}} that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told [[Oprah Winfrey]] that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".<ref>Barry Garron, [https://www.today.com/popculture/being-bobby-brown-disgusting-wbna8409211 \"'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting\"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.</ref> Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.<ref>Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php \"Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season\"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.</ref> The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season.

Brown, alongside frequent collaborator [[Teddy Riley]], is noted as a pioneer of [[new jack swing]]; a fusion of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]].

Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.\n\nBrown also starred in films such as ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'' and ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]''. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005.

Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]], to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album ''[[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]''. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their [[New Edition|self-titled second release]]. The album included the crossover hits \"[[Cool It Now]]\" and \"[[Mr. Telephone Man]],\" which Brown also co-led.\n\nDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= How Cruel Can Fame Be, Bobby Brown? |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-63_1_bobby-brown|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Robert|last=Hilburn}}</ref> Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a [[VH-1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision.\n\n===Solo career===\nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album ''[[King of Stage]]'' in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"[[Girlfriend (Bobby Brown song)|Girlfriend]],\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well.\n\nBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Teddy Riley]]. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name=\":9\" /> including the number-one single, the self-penned \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which became, along with \"[[Every Little Step]]\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bobby-brown|title=Bobby Brown|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ''Don't Be Cruel'' also garnered Brown two [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]].\n\nIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, ''[[Dance!...Ya Know It!]]'', was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the ''Don't Be Cruel'' project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/bobby-browns-cruel-beguiles-fans-but-not-the-cop-who-nabbed-him-for-dirty-dancing-vol-31-no-14/|title=Bobby Brown's Cruel Beguiles Fans\u2014but Not the Cop Who Nabbed Him for Dirty Dancing|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|last2=Holmstrom|first2=Rick|date=April 10, 1989|website=People.com|language=EN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 [[MTV Awards]], and Brown was set to release the album ''Mystical Magic'', but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day. In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" by [[Glenn Medeiros]], making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend [[Ralph Tresvant]] on the latter's single \"[[Stone Cold Gentleman]]\", which was a top-five R&B hit.\n\nBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]],\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> He received his third [[American Music Award]] in January 1993. However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to [[Whitney Houston]], and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"[[Something in Common]],\" which was released as a single from the ''Bobby'' album.  Four years later he would release his fourth solo album ''[[Forever (Bobby Brown album)|Forever]]'', in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.\n\nPrior to the release of ''Forever'', Brown had been in negotiations with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label [[Death Row East]]. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following ''Forever'', Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from ''[[The Benzino Project]]'', and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper [[Ja Rule]] on the song \"[[Thug Lovin']].\" Brown was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]], but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to [[Damian Marley]]'s song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, ''[[Welcome to Jamrock]]''. \n\nIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled ''Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But'', written by author Derrick Handspike.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/author-reveals-why-bobby-brown-backed-ou/|title=Author Reveals Why Bobby Brown Backed Out of Tell-All Book Deal|last=|first=|date=December 16, 2009|website=Essence|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584747/bobby-browns-autobiography-claims-whitney-houston-introduced-him-to-hard-drugs/|title=Bobby Brown's Autobiography Claims Whitney Houston Introduced Him To Hard Drugs|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=April 3, 2008|website=MTV|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But|last=Handspike|first=Derrick|publisher=Over The Edge Books|year=2012|isbn=9781467519441|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer [[Macy Gray]] on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album ''[[The Sellout (album)|The Sellout]]''.

However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.\n\nIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death of the group's idol Michael Jackson]], all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of [[Jackson 5]] hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year.

In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', and had a major role in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film, ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]'', ''[[Gang of Roses]]'', ''[[Nora's Hair Salon]]'' and ''Go for Broke''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown signed a deal with [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] to overlook the direction of the reality series, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', but it was said{{by whom|date=June 2018}} that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told [[Oprah Winfrey]] that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".<ref>Barry Garron, [https://www.today.com/popculture/being-bobby-brown-disgusting-wbna8409211 \"'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting\"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.</ref> Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.<ref>Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php \"Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season\"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.</ref> The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season.
