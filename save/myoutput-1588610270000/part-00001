[[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] had their contracts, with First National and [[Famous Players-Lasky]] respectively, running out soon with no offers forthcoming. Sydney Chaplin, brother and business manager for Charlie, check with Pickford and Fairbanks and deduced something was up. The trio hired a private detective to find out. The detective turned up a plan to merge all production companies and lock in exhibition companies with five year contracts.<ref name=uacbs/>\n\nPickford, Chaplin, [[Douglas Fairbanks|Fairbanks]], and [[D.

Hart]] a year earlier. Already Hollywood veterans, the four stars talked of forming their own company to better control their own work.\n\nThey were spurred on by established Hollywood producers and distributors who were tightening their control over actor salaries and creative decisions, a process that evolved into the [[studio system]]. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before anything was formalized. When he heard about their scheme, [[Richard A.

O'Brien (right)<br>stand in the background.]]\n\nUA's first production, ''[[His Majesty, the American]]'', written by and starring Fairbanks, was a success. Funding for movies was limited. Without selling stock to the public like other studios, all United had for finance was weekly prepayment installments from theater owners for upcoming movies. As a result, production was slow, and the company distributed an average of only five films a year in its first five years.<ref name=\"fu\">{{cite web| title=History of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/metro-goldwyn-mayer-inc-history/| website=Funding Universe| accessdate=December 20, 2014| language=en}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1924, Griffith had dropped out, and the company was facing a crisis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Veteran producer [[Joseph Schenck]] was hired as president.<ref name=\"fu\" /> He had produced pictures for a decade,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and brought commitments for films starring his wife, [[Norma Talmadge]],<ref name=\"fu\" /> his sister-in-law, [[Constance Talmadge]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and his brother-in-law, [[Buster Keaton]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> Contracts were signed with independent producers, including [[Samuel Goldwyn]], and [[Howard Hughes]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> In 1933, Schenck organized a new company with [[Darryl&nbsp;F. Zanuck]], called [[Twentieth Century Pictures]], which soon provided four pictures a year, forming half of UA's schedule.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nSchenck formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name. They began international operations, first in Canada, and then in Mexico. By the end of the 1930s, United Artists was represented in over 40 countries.\n\nWhen he was denied an ownership share in 1935, Schenck resigned. He set up [[Twentieth Century Pictures|20th Century Pictures]]' merger with [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corporation]] to form [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/zanuck-schenck.htm|title=The Formation of Twentieth Century-Fox (20th Century Fox)|website=www.cobbles.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> [[Al Lichtman]] succeeded Schenck as company president. Other independent producers distributed through United Artists in the 1930s including [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], [[Alexander Korda]], [[Hal Roach]], [[David O. Selznick]], and [[Walter Wanger]].<ref name=\"fu\"/> As the years passed, and the dynamics of the business changed, these \"producing partners\" drifted away. [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]] and [[Disney]] went to [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and Wanger to [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nIn the late 1930s, UA turned a profit. Goldwyn was providing most of the output for distribution. He sued United several times for disputed compensation leading him to leave. MGM's 1939 hit ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was supposed to be a UA release except that Selznick wanted [[Clark Gable]], who was under contract to MGM, to play [[Rhett Butler]]. Also that year, Fairbanks died.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nUA became embroiled in lawsuits with Selznick over his distribution of some films through [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. Selznick considered UA's operation sloppy, and left to start his own distribution arm.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nIn the 1940s, United Artists was losing money because of poorly received pictures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Cinema attendance continued to decline as television became more popular.<ref name=\"fu\"/>  The company sold its Mexican releasing division to Cr\u00e9dito Cinematogr\u00e1fico Mexicano, a local company.\n\n===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (1940s and 1950s)===\nIn 1941, Pickford, Chaplin, Disney, [[Orson Welles]], Goldwyn, Selznick, Alexander Korda, and Wanger\u2014many of whom were members of United Artists\u2014formed the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP). Later members included [[Hunt Stromberg]], [[William Cagney]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Hal Roach]].\n\nThe Society aimed to advance the interests of independent producers in an industry controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end ostensibly anti-competitive practices by the seven major film studios\u2014Loew's (MGM), [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], RKO Radio Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros./First National]]\u2014that controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of motion pictures.\n\nIn 1942, SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount's [[United Paramount Theaters|United Detroit Theatres]]. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. This was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors that alleged monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Paramount Decision]] ordered the major Hollywood [[movie studio]]s to sell their theater chains and to end certain anti-competitive practices. This court ruling ended the studio system.\n\nBy 1958, SIMPP achieved many of the goals that led to its creation, and the group ceased operations.\n\n===Krim and Benjamin===\nNeeding a turnaround, Pickford and Chaplin hired [[Paul V. McNutt]] in 1950,<ref name=UA40/> a former governor of Indiana, as chairman and Frank L. McNamee as president. McNutt did not have the skill to solve UA's financial problems and the pair was replaced after only a few months.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nOn February 15, 1951, lawyers-turned-producers [[Arthur B.

Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio but did not own a studio lot. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance, or the expensive production staff at other studios.\n\nAmong their first clients were [[Sam Spiegel]] and [[John Huston]], whose Horizon Productions gave UA one major hit, ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951) and a substantial success, ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952). As well as ''The African Queen'' UA also had success with ''[[High Noon]]'' in their first year, earning a profit of $313,000 compared to a loss of $871,000 the previous year.<ref name=UA40/><ref name=\"fu\"/>  Others clients followed, among them [[Stanley Kramer]], [[Otto Preminger]], [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions]], and actors newly freed from studio contracts and seeking to produce or direct their own films.\n\nWith the instability in the film industry due to theater divestment, the business was considered risky. In 1955, movie attendance reached its lowest level since 1923. Chaplin sold his 25 percent share during this crisis to Krim and Benjamin for $1.1&nbsp;million, followed a year later by Pickford who sold her share for $3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nIn the late 1950s, United Artists produced two modest films that became financial and critical successes for the company. The company made ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' which won 1955's Palme d'Or and best picture Oscar. ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957) which according to Krim before home video, was being seen on TV 24 hours a day, 365 days a year some place in the world.<ref name=\"vt0\"/> By 1958, UA was making annual profits of $3&nbsp;million a year.<ref name=UA40/>\n\n===Public company===\nUnited Artists went public in 1957 with a $17&nbsp;million stock and [[debenture]] offering.

In 1964, UA introduced U.S. film audiences to [[the Beatles]] by releasing ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964) and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965).\n\nAt the same time, it backed two expatriate North Americans in Britain, who had acquired screen rights to [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] novels. For $1&nbsp;million, UA backed [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert Broccoli]]'s ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1963 and launched the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond franchise]].<ref name=VF>{{cite journal| last1=Kamp| first1=David| title=Fifty Years of Bond, James Bond: The Greatest Film Franchise\u2019s Biggest Birthday |journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]| date=October 2012| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/10/fifty-years-of-james-bond| accessdate=October 1, 2017| quote=In 1961, Broccoli worked his connections to secure a meeting in New York with Arthur Krim, the head of United Artists.

Other successful projects backed in this period included the ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]]'' series, which began in 1964, and [[Spaghetti Western]]s, which made a star of [[Clint Eastwood]] in the films of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]''.\n\nIn 1964, the French subsidiary, Les Productions Artistes Associ\u00e9s, released its first production ''[[That Man from Rio]]''.\n\nIn 1965, UA released the anticipated George Stevens' production of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' and was at the time, the most expensive film which was budgeted at $20 million. Max Von Sydow in the role of Jesus Christ, lead an all-star cast which includes Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowell, Martin Landau, Dorothy McGuire, Sal Mineo, Ina Balin, Joanna Dunham, David McCallum, Nehemiah Persoff, Donald Pleasence, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and Ed Wynn. Some had cameos for only a brief moment in the picture: Angela Lansbury, Sidney Poitier, Shelley Winters, Pat Boone and John Wayne as the Centurion who supervises Christ\u2019s crucifixion. While the film was released in Ultra Panavision 70 and included several breathtaking scenes of cinematography, the film didn\u2019t make back its budget and was released to mixed critical receptions, but it has since been acclaimed as a classic by audiences around the world for being admirably inspired in its attempt to be faithful to the four books of the New Testament in the Holy Bible plus the book of the same name by Fulton Oursler and the radio program. \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" received five Academy Award\u00ae nominations in 1965 and received an accolade\nas one of the \u201cTop 10 Films of the Year\u201d from The National Board of Review.\n\n===Transamerica subsidiary===\n[[File:United Artists logo 1975.svg|thumb|The second United Artists logo, used during the company's sale to Transamerica from 1967 until 1982.]]\nOn the basis of its film and television hits, in 1967, [[Transamerica Corporation]] purchased 98 percent of UA's stock.

Known as United Artists Digital Studios, the company's projects include mid-form original series ''[[Stargate Origins]]'', interactive digital series ''#[[WarGames]]'', and scripted series ''[[The Baxters]]'' (which is also the first for LightWorkers Media) and ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bond |first1=Paul |title=MGM's Revenue on the Rise, But Net Income Struggles |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgms-revenue-rise-but-net-income-struggles-1134873 |accessdate=September 13, 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 14, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In early October 2018, MGM and Walmart agreed to a partnership for MGM Digital to create exclusive content for Walmart's [[Vudu]] and Movies On Us service to begin showing in the first quarter 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Spangler |first1=Todd |title=Walmart\u2019s Vudu Orders MGM Shows for Free, Ad-Supported Video Service |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/walmart-vudu-mgm-shows-free-ad-supported-streaming-1202970491/ |accessdate=October 9, 2018 |work=Variety |date=October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMGM's and Annapurna Pictures' Mirror distribution venture was rebranded as '''United Artists Releasing''' on February 5, 2019, 100 years to the day of United Artists' founding.<ref name=\"Donnelly\"/>\n\n==Library and historical list of films==\n{{main|List of United Artists films}}\n\nA majority of UA's post-1952 library is now owned by MGM, while the pre-1952 films (with few exceptions) are now either owned by other companies (such as [[Turner Entertainment]]) or are in the [[public domain]]. However, throughout the studio's history, UA acted more as a distributor than a film studio, crediting the copyright to the production company responsible. This explains why certain UA releases, such as ''High Noon'' (1952) and ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'' (1980), are still under copyright but not owned by MGM.{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}} The MGM titles which UA distributed from 1973 to 1982 are now owned by Turner.\n\n==UA films on video==\nUA originally leased the home video rights to its films to [[Magnetic Video]], the first home video company. Fox purchased Magnetic in 1981 and renamed it [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|20th Century-Fox Video]] that year. In 1982, 20th Century-Fox Video merged with [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Video Enterprises]] (which earlier split from [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/CBS Home Video]] after MGM merged with UA) giving birth to [[CBS/Fox Video]]. Although MGM owned UA around this time, UA's licensing deal with CBS/Fox was still in effect. However, the newly renamed [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] started releasing some UA product, including UA films originally released in the mid-80s. Prior to MGM's purchase, UA licensed foreign video rights to Warner Bros. through [[Warner Home Video]], in a deal that was set to expire in 1991.<ref>{{cite news| last=Fabrikant| first=Geraldine| title=For MGM/UA, Bidders Are Scarce| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/31/business/for-mgm-ua-bidders-are-scarce.html?src=pm| newspaper=The New York Times| date=May 31, 1988}}</ref> In 1986, the pre-1950 WB and the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries were purchased by Ted Turner after his short-lived ownership of MGM/UA, and as a result CBS/Fox lost home video rights to the pre-1950 WB films to [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]]. When the deal with CBS/Fox (inherited from Magnetic Video) expired in 1989, the UA released films were released through MGM/UA Home Video.\n\nBefore the Magnetic Video and Warner Home Video deals in 1980, United Artists had exclusive rental contacts with a small video label called [[VidAmerica]] in the US, and another small label called Intervision Video in the UK.<ref name=ncn>{{cite news |last=Bins |first=Chuck |date=December 23, 1980 |title=VCR revolution to provide wide selection for TV viewers |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Worldbruce%20Wikipedia/clipnumber/34940/ |newspaper=[[New Castle News]] |page=8}}{{open access}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-Panorama-TV-IDX/IDX/Panorama-TV-1980-02-OCR-Page-0101.pdf#search=%22allied%22 |title=This Month |journal=Panorama |date=October 8, 2013 |format=pdf |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Europe Moves Forward in Copyright Levy Push| journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=October 4, 1980| page=87| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false| accessdate=October 1, 2017| language=en| issn=0006-2510| first=George| last=Kopp}}</ref> for the home video release of 20 titles from the UA library (e.g. ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', and ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'', along with a few pre-1950 WB titles).\n\n==United Artists Broadcasting==\nUnited Artists owned and operated two television stations between the years of 1968 and 1977.

[[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] had their contracts, with First National and [[Famous Players-Lasky]] respectively, running out soon with no offers forthcoming. Sydney Chaplin, brother and business manager for Charlie, check with Pickford and Fairbanks and deduced something was up. The trio hired a private detective to find out. The detective turned up a plan to merge all production companies and lock in exhibition companies with five year contracts.<ref name=uacbs/>\n\nPickford, Chaplin, [[Douglas Fairbanks|Fairbanks]], and [[D.

Hart]] a year earlier. Already Hollywood veterans, the four stars talked of forming their own company to better control their own work.\n\nThey were spurred on by established Hollywood producers and distributors who were tightening their control over actor salaries and creative decisions, a process that evolved into the [[studio system]]. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before anything was formalized. When he heard about their scheme, [[Richard A.

O'Brien (right)<br>stand in the background.]]\n\nUA's first production, ''[[His Majesty, the American]]'', written by and starring Fairbanks, was a success. Funding for movies was limited. Without selling stock to the public like other studios, all United had for finance was weekly prepayment installments from theater owners for upcoming movies. As a result, production was slow, and the company distributed an average of only five films a year in its first five years.<ref name=\"fu\">{{cite web| title=History of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/metro-goldwyn-mayer-inc-history/| website=Funding Universe| accessdate=December 20, 2014| language=en}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1924, Griffith had dropped out, and the company was facing a crisis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Veteran producer [[Joseph Schenck]] was hired as president.<ref name=\"fu\" /> He had produced pictures for a decade,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and brought commitments for films starring his wife, [[Norma Talmadge]],<ref name=\"fu\" /> his sister-in-law, [[Constance Talmadge]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and his brother-in-law, [[Buster Keaton]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> Contracts were signed with independent producers, including [[Samuel Goldwyn]], and [[Howard Hughes]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> In 1933, Schenck organized a new company with [[Darryl&nbsp;F. Zanuck]], called [[Twentieth Century Pictures]], which soon provided four pictures a year, forming half of UA's schedule.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nSchenck formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name. They began international operations, first in Canada, and then in Mexico. By the end of the 1930s, United Artists was represented in over 40 countries.\n\nWhen he was denied an ownership share in 1935, Schenck resigned. He set up [[Twentieth Century Pictures|20th Century Pictures]]' merger with [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corporation]] to form [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/zanuck-schenck.htm|title=The Formation of Twentieth Century-Fox (20th Century Fox)|website=www.cobbles.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> [[Al Lichtman]] succeeded Schenck as company president. Other independent producers distributed through United Artists in the 1930s including [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], [[Alexander Korda]], [[Hal Roach]], [[David O. Selznick]], and [[Walter Wanger]].<ref name=\"fu\"/> As the years passed, and the dynamics of the business changed, these \"producing partners\" drifted away. [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]] and [[Disney]] went to [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and Wanger to [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nIn the late 1930s, UA turned a profit. Goldwyn was providing most of the output for distribution. He sued United several times for disputed compensation leading him to leave. MGM's 1939 hit ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was supposed to be a UA release except that Selznick wanted [[Clark Gable]], who was under contract to MGM, to play [[Rhett Butler]]. Also that year, Fairbanks died.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nUA became embroiled in lawsuits with Selznick over his distribution of some films through [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. Selznick considered UA's operation sloppy, and left to start his own distribution arm.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nIn the 1940s, United Artists was losing money because of poorly received pictures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Cinema attendance continued to decline as television became more popular.<ref name=\"fu\"/>  The company sold its Mexican releasing division to Cr\u00e9dito Cinematogr\u00e1fico Mexicano, a local company.\n\n===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (1940s and 1950s)===\nIn 1941, Pickford, Chaplin, Disney, [[Orson Welles]], Goldwyn, Selznick, Alexander Korda, and Wanger\u2014many of whom were members of United Artists\u2014formed the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP). Later members included [[Hunt Stromberg]], [[William Cagney]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Hal Roach]].\n\nThe Society aimed to advance the interests of independent producers in an industry controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end ostensibly anti-competitive practices by the seven major film studios\u2014Loew's (MGM), [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], RKO Radio Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros./First National]]\u2014that controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of motion pictures.\n\nIn 1942, SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount's [[United Paramount Theaters|United Detroit Theatres]]. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. This was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors that alleged monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Paramount Decision]] ordered the major Hollywood [[movie studio]]s to sell their theater chains and to end certain anti-competitive practices. This court ruling ended the studio system.\n\nBy 1958, SIMPP achieved many of the goals that led to its creation, and the group ceased operations.\n\n===Krim and Benjamin===\nNeeding a turnaround, Pickford and Chaplin hired [[Paul V. McNutt]] in 1950,<ref name=UA40/> a former governor of Indiana, as chairman and Frank L. McNamee as president. McNutt did not have the skill to solve UA's financial problems and the pair was replaced after only a few months.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nOn February 15, 1951, lawyers-turned-producers [[Arthur B.

Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio but did not own a studio lot. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance, or the expensive production staff at other studios.\n\nAmong their first clients were [[Sam Spiegel]] and [[John Huston]], whose Horizon Productions gave UA one major hit, ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951) and a substantial success, ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952). As well as ''The African Queen'' UA also had success with ''[[High Noon]]'' in their first year, earning a profit of $313,000 compared to a loss of $871,000 the previous year.<ref name=UA40/><ref name=\"fu\"/>  Others clients followed, among them [[Stanley Kramer]], [[Otto Preminger]], [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions]], and actors newly freed from studio contracts and seeking to produce or direct their own films.\n\nWith the instability in the film industry due to theater divestment, the business was considered risky. In 1955, movie attendance reached its lowest level since 1923. Chaplin sold his 25 percent share during this crisis to Krim and Benjamin for $1.1&nbsp;million, followed a year later by Pickford who sold her share for $3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nIn the late 1950s, United Artists produced two modest films that became financial and critical successes for the company. The company made ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' which won 1955's Palme d'Or and best picture Oscar. ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957) which according to Krim before home video, was being seen on TV 24 hours a day, 365 days a year some place in the world.<ref name=\"vt0\"/> By 1958, UA was making annual profits of $3&nbsp;million a year.<ref name=UA40/>\n\n===Public company===\nUnited Artists went public in 1957 with a $17&nbsp;million stock and [[debenture]] offering.

(film)|Help!]]'' (1965).\n\nAt the same time, it backed two expatriate North Americans in Britain, who had acquired screen rights to [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] novels. For $1&nbsp;million, UA backed [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert Broccoli]]'s ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1963 and launched the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond franchise]].<ref name=VF>{{cite journal| last1=Kamp| first1=David| title=Fifty Years of Bond, James Bond: The Greatest Film Franchise\u2019s Biggest Birthday |journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]| date=October 2012| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/10/fifty-years-of-james-bond| accessdate=October 1, 2017| quote=In 1961, Broccoli worked his connections to secure a meeting in New York with Arthur Krim, the head of United Artists.

Other successful projects backed in this period included the ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]]'' series, which began in 1964, and [[Spaghetti Western]]s, which made a star of [[Clint Eastwood]] in the films of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]''.\n\nIn 1964, the French subsidiary, Les Productions Artistes Associ\u00e9s, released its first production ''[[That Man from Rio]]''.\n\nIn 1965, UA released the anticipated George Stevens' production of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' and was at the time, the most expensive film which was budgeted at $20 million. Max Von Sydow in the role of Jesus Christ, lead an all-star cast which includes Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowell, Martin Landau, Dorothy McGuire, Sal Mineo, Ina Balin, Joanna Dunham, David McCallum, Nehemiah Persoff, Donald Pleasence, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and Ed Wynn. Some had cameos for only a brief moment in the picture: Angela Lansbury, Sidney Poitier, Shelley Winters, Pat Boone and John Wayne as the Centurion who supervises Christ\u2019s crucifixion. While the film was released in Ultra Panavision 70 and included several breathtaking scenes of cinematography, the film didn\u2019t make back its budget and was released to mixed critical receptions, but it has since been acclaimed as a classic by audiences around the world for being admirably inspired in its attempt to be faithful to the four books of the New Testament in the Holy Bible plus the book of the same name by Fulton Oursler and the radio program. \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" received five Academy Award\u00ae nominations in 1965 and received an accolade\nas one of the \u201cTop 10 Films of the Year\u201d from The National Board of Review.\n\n===Transamerica subsidiary===\n[[File:United Artists logo 1975.svg|thumb|The second United Artists logo, used during the company's sale to Transamerica from 1967 until 1982.]]\nOn the basis of its film and television hits, in 1967, [[Transamerica Corporation]] purchased 98 percent of UA's stock.

Known as United Artists Digital Studios, the company's projects include mid-form original series ''[[Stargate Origins]]'', interactive digital series ''#[[WarGames]]'', and scripted series ''[[The Baxters]]'' (which is also the first for LightWorkers Media) and ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bond |first1=Paul |title=MGM's Revenue on the Rise, But Net Income Struggles |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgms-revenue-rise-but-net-income-struggles-1134873 |accessdate=September 13, 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 14, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In early October 2018, MGM and Walmart agreed to a partnership for MGM Digital to create exclusive content for Walmart's [[Vudu]] and Movies On Us service to begin showing in the first quarter 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Spangler |first1=Todd |title=Walmart\u2019s Vudu Orders MGM Shows for Free, Ad-Supported Video Service |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/walmart-vudu-mgm-shows-free-ad-supported-streaming-1202970491/ |accessdate=October 9, 2018 |work=Variety |date=October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMGM's and Annapurna Pictures' Mirror distribution venture was rebranded as '''United Artists Releasing''' on February 5, 2019, 100 years to the day of United Artists' founding.<ref name=\"Donnelly\"/>\n\n==Library and historical list of films==\n{{main|List of United Artists films}}\n\nA majority of UA's post-1952 library is now owned by MGM, while the pre-1952 films (with few exceptions) are now either owned by other companies (such as [[Turner Entertainment]]) or are in the [[public domain]]. However, throughout the studio's history, UA acted more as a distributor than a film studio, crediting the copyright to the production company responsible. This explains why certain UA releases, such as ''High Noon'' (1952) and ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'' (1980), are still under copyright but not owned by MGM.{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}} The MGM titles which UA distributed from 1973 to 1982 are now owned by Turner.\n\n==UA films on video==\nUA originally leased the home video rights to its films to [[Magnetic Video]], the first home video company. Fox purchased Magnetic in 1981 and renamed it [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|20th Century-Fox Video]] that year. In 1982, 20th Century-Fox Video merged with [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Video Enterprises]] (which earlier split from [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/CBS Home Video]] after MGM merged with UA) giving birth to [[CBS/Fox Video]]. Although MGM owned UA around this time, UA's licensing deal with CBS/Fox was still in effect. However, the newly renamed [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] started releasing some UA product, including UA films originally released in the mid-80s. Prior to MGM's purchase, UA licensed foreign video rights to Warner Bros. through [[Warner Home Video]], in a deal that was set to expire in 1991.<ref>{{cite news| last=Fabrikant| first=Geraldine| title=For MGM/UA, Bidders Are Scarce| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/31/business/for-mgm-ua-bidders-are-scarce.html?src=pm| newspaper=The New York Times| date=May 31, 1988}}</ref> In 1986, the pre-1950 WB and the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries were purchased by Ted Turner after his short-lived ownership of MGM/UA, and as a result CBS/Fox lost home video rights to the pre-1950 WB films to [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]]. When the deal with CBS/Fox (inherited from Magnetic Video) expired in 1989, the UA released films were released through MGM/UA Home Video.\n\nBefore the Magnetic Video and Warner Home Video deals in 1980, United Artists had exclusive rental contacts with a small video label called [[VidAmerica]] in the US, and another small label called Intervision Video in the UK.<ref name=ncn>{{cite news |last=Bins |first=Chuck |date=December 23, 1980 |title=VCR revolution to provide wide selection for TV viewers |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Worldbruce%20Wikipedia/clipnumber/34940/ |newspaper=[[New Castle News]] |page=8}}{{open access}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-Panorama-TV-IDX/IDX/Panorama-TV-1980-02-OCR-Page-0101.pdf#search=%22allied%22 |title=This Month |journal=Panorama |date=October 8, 2013 |format=pdf |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Europe Moves Forward in Copyright Levy Push| journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=October 4, 1980| page=87| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false| accessdate=October 1, 2017| language=en| issn=0006-2510| first=George| last=Kopp}}</ref> for the home video release of 20 titles from the UA library (e.g. ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', and ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'', along with a few pre-1950 WB titles).\n\n==United Artists Broadcasting==\nUnited Artists owned and operated two television stations between the years of 1968 and 1977.
