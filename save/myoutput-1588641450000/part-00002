It is {{convert|43|mi|km}} south of [[Salt Lake City]] along the [[Wasatch Front]]. Provo is the largest city and [[county seat]] of [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]]. It is home to [[Brigham Young University]], and [[Sundance Resort]] is located just northeast of the city.\n\nWhile Father [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]], a Spanish Franciscan missionary-explorer, is considered the first European visitor to the area that would become Provo, the first permanent settlement was established in 1849 as [[Fort Utah]]. The name was changed to \"Provo\" in 1850, in honor of [[\u00c9tienne Provost]], an early French-Canadian trapper. Provo's climate lies in the transition zone between a [[humid subtropical climate]] and [[humid continental climate]], with high temperatures averaging between about {{convert|94|F|C|1|disp=or}} in the summer and {{convert|40|F|C|1|disp=or}} in the winter. Average annual precipitation (rain and snow) is just under {{convert|20|in|cm}}. The population of Provo has grown from 2030 in 1860 to an estimated 116,702 in 2018. The 2010 census showed slightly more females than males, with over 55% of the population living as couples, and almost 35% of households having children under the age of 18. The population is over 90% Christian, with almost 89% being [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]]. \n\nThe economy in Provo is powered by many different businesses and organizations, including over 100 restaurants, two shopping malls, multiple universities and colleges, a number of small companies, and several large international businesses. [[Utah Valley Hospital]] is a Level II Trauma Center, and has several campuses of medical professionals surrounding it. [[America's Freedom Festival at Provo]], held every May through July, is one of the largest [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations in the United States. Several cultural points of interest in the city include the Covey Center for the Arts, the LDS [[Missionary Training Center]], and the [[Provo City Library|Provo City Library at Academy Square]]. Provo contains two [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]]: [[Provo Utah Temple]] and [[Provo City Center Temple]], the latter being restored from the ruins of the [[Provo Tabernacle]]. The Utah Valley Convention Center is also located in downtown Provo. There are several museums located on the campus of Brigham Young University.\n\nNatural features include [[Bridal Veil Falls (Utah)|Bridal Veil Falls]], [[Provo River]], [[Utah Lake]] and [[Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. [[Timpanogos Cave National Monument]] is located several miles north of Provo. A number of national historic landmarks are located within Provo, including the [[Reed O. Smoot House]]. Provo is served by [[Utah Transit Authority]], operator of the [[FrontRunner]] commuter rail and a bus service connected to the rest of the [[Wasatch Front]]. [[Amtrak]] stops at [[Provo station (Amtrak)|Provo station]], providing daily access to its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' service. [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]], [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. 89]] and [[U.S. Route 189|U.S. 189]] provide major road service to Provo.

At first, they were friendly with the Mormons. But, as relations deteriorated with the Shoshoni and Utes because of disputes over land and cattle, tensions rose. Because of the reported stolen goods of settlers by the Utes, Brigham Young gave a small militia orders \"to take such measures as would put a final end to their [Indian] depredations in future.\" This ended in what is known as the [[Battle Creek massacre]], in modern-day [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]].\n \nThe Mormons continued pushing into Timpanog lands.

One of these peaks, known as [[Y Mountain]], towers over the city. There is a large [[hillside letter]] ''Y'' made of whitewashed concrete halfway up the steep mountain, built in the early part of the 20th century to commemorate [[Brigham Young University]] (original plans included construction of all three letters: BYU). Wild deer (and less frequently, [[cougar]]s, and [[moose]]) still roam the mountains (and occasionally the city streets). The geography allows for hiking, [[skiing]], [[fishing]] and other outdoor activities.\n\n===Climate===\nProvo's climate lies in the transition zone between a [[humid subtropical climate]] and [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''/''Dfa''), though summers are barely wet enough to avoid a [[Mediterranean climate]] classification (''Csa''/''Dsa''). Overall, annual rainfall at the location of Brigham Young University is around {{convert|19.75|in|mm|-1|disp=or}}; however, the western part of the metropolitan area near Orem is substantially drier, receiving only around {{convert|13.5|in|mm|-1|disp=or}} of precipitation and consequently has a [[semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid climate]] (K\u00f6ppen ''BSk'').<ref name = NOAA /> The wettest calendar year in Provo has been 1983 with {{convert|37.54|in|mm|1}} and the driest 2002 with {{convert|10.65|in|mm|1}}.<ref name = NOAA />\n \nWinters are cold with substantial snowfall averaging {{convert|57.2|in|m|2|disp=or}} and a record monthly total of {{convert|66.0|in|m|2}} in January 1918, during which the record snow cover of {{convert|34|in|m|2|disp=or}} was record on the 17th.

Very cold weather may occur when cold air from over the [[Continental Divide]] invades the region: although only four mornings fall to or below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} during an average winter and this temperature was not reached at all between 1999 and 2006, during the very cold January 1917 (average temperature {{convert|14.9|F|C|1|disp=or}}), seventeen mornings fell this cold.<ref name = NOAA /> By contrast, in several recent winters like 1994\u201395, 1995\u201396, 1999\u20132000, 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306, averages have been above freezing during every month.\n \nTemperatures warm rapidly during the spring, with the first afternoon over {{convert|70|F|C|1|disp=or}} on March 21, the last freeze expected on April 29, and the first temperature equal to or hotter than {{convert|90|F|C|1|disp=or}} on May 30. Rainfall is not infrequent during the spring: over {{convert|5.10|in|mm|-1|disp=or}} was recorded in the Mays of 1995 and 2011, and a total of {{convert|12.29|in|mm|1}} fell during the four-month span of March to June, 2005 \u2013 in contrast as little as {{convert|2.04|in|mm|1}} fell in the same months of 2012.<ref name = NOAA />\n \nBeing too far north to gain any influence from [[North American Monsoon|the monsoon]] except in rare cases like the {{convert|4.38|in|mm|1}} rainfall of August 1983, the summers of Provo are hot and dry, though relatively short \u2013 no maxima above {{convert|100|F|C|1|disp=or}} have been recorded outside the range of June 7 to August 27.

The 2010 census showed slightly more females than males, with over 55% of the population living as couples, and almost 35% of households having children under the age of 18. The population is over 90% Christian, with almost 89% being [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]]. \n\nThe economy in Provo is powered by many different businesses and organizations, including over 100 restaurants, two shopping malls, multiple universities and colleges, a number of small companies, and several large international businesses. [[Utah Valley Hospital]] is a Level II Trauma Center, and has several campuses of medical professionals surrounding it. [[America's Freedom Festival at Provo]], held every May through July, is one of the largest [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations in the United States. Several cultural points of interest in the city include the Covey Center for the Arts, the LDS [[Missionary Training Center]], and the [[Provo City Library|Provo City Library at Academy Square]]. Provo contains two [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]]: [[Provo Utah Temple]] and [[Provo City Center Temple]], the latter being restored from the ruins of the [[Provo Tabernacle]]. The Utah Valley Convention Center is also located in downtown Provo. There are several museums located on the campus of Brigham Young University.\n\nNatural features include [[Bridal Veil Falls (Utah)|Bridal Veil Falls]], [[Provo River]], [[Utah Lake]] and [[Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. [[Timpanogos Cave National Monument]] is located several miles north of Provo. A number of national historic landmarks are located within Provo, including the [[Reed O. Smoot House]]. Provo is served by [[Utah Transit Authority]], operator of the [[FrontRunner]] commuter rail and a bus service connected to the rest of the [[Wasatch Front]]. [[Amtrak]] stops at [[Provo station (Amtrak)|Provo station]], providing daily access to its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' service. [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]], [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah|U.S. 89]] and [[U.S. Route 189|U.S. 189]] provide major road service to Provo.

At first, they were friendly with the Mormons. But, as relations deteriorated with the Shoshoni and Utes because of disputes over land and cattle, tensions rose. Because of the reported stolen goods of settlers by the Utes, Brigham Young gave a small militia orders \"to take such measures as would put a final end to their [Indian] depredations in future.\" This ended in what is known as the [[Battle Creek massacre]], in modern-day [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]].\n \nThe Mormons continued pushing into Timpanog lands. In 1849, 33 [[Mormon]] families from Salt Lake City established [[Fort Utah]].

One of these peaks, known as [[Y Mountain]], towers over the city. There is a large [[hillside letter]] ''Y'' made of whitewashed concrete halfway up the steep mountain, built in the early part of the 20th century to commemorate [[Brigham Young University]] (original plans included construction of all three letters: BYU). Wild deer (and less frequently, [[cougar]]s, and [[moose]]) still roam the mountains (and occasionally the city streets).
