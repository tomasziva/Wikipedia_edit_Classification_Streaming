Ben Dorr, a head member of the advocacy group, has repeatedly called for the state to reopen and has erroneously claimed that [[COVID-19]] poses no greater threat to public health than the flu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/04/20/behind-calls-to-reopen-economy-a-mn-activist-and-his-family|title=Behind rallies to reopen economy, a Minnesota activist and his family|website=MPR News|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> Dorr has two older brothers who are also gun-rights advocates. The three have used their collective social media presence to call for additional protests.\n\nDuring his usual daily press conference, Governor Walz announced that it was now permitted for people to engage in various outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, hunting, and motor-boating so long as they maintained a safe and reasonable distance from other people. As well as allowing people to engage in various outdoor activities, he allowed golf courses and bait shops to open.<ref>https://mn.gov/governor/assets/EO%2020-38%20Final_tcm1055-428887.pdf</ref>
