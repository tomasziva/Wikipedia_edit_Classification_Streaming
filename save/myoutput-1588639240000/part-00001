When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or ''virions'', consisting of: (i) the [[genetic material]], i.e. long [[molecule]]s of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, the ''[[capsid]]'', which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]] as they are one hundredth the size of most bacteria.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Rybicki EP |year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182\u201386}}</ref> and as [[Self-replication|replicators]].<ref name=\"pmid26965225\"/>\n\nViruses spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections. Several [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word is from the Latin neuter {{lang|la|v\u012brus}} referring to [[poison]] and other noxious liquids, from the same [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European base]] as [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|vi\u1e63a}}, [[Avestan]] {{lang|ae|v\u012b\u0161a}}, and [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f30\u03cc\u03c2}} (all meaning \"poison\"), first [[Attested language|attested]] in English in 1398 in [[John Trevisa|John Trevisa's]] translation of [[Bartholomeus Anglicus|Bartholomeus Anglicus's]] ''De Proprietatibus Rerum''.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virus, n. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\">{{cite web | title=virus | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virus|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> ''Virulent'', from Latin ''virulentus'' (poisonous), dates to c. 1400.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virulent, adj. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web \n|title=virulent | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virulent |access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> A meaning of \"agent that causes infectious disease\" is first recorded in 1728,<ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\" /> long before the discovery of viruses by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented.

Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle.

Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation.

This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human [[leucocytes]]. This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule\u2014a [[chemokine receptor]]\u2014which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.<ref name=\"pmid23737062\">{{cite journal | vauthors = M\u00e1s V, Melero JA | title = Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells: membrane fusion | journal = Sub-Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 68 | issue =  | pages = 467\u201387 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23737062 | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16 | isbn = 978-94-007-6551-1 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry }}</ref>\n\n''[[Viral entry|Penetration]]'' follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] or [[Lipid bilayer fusion|membrane fusion]] in a process often known as [[viral entry]]. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of [[cellulose]], and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall.<ref>Dimmock p. 70</ref> Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called [[plasmodesma]]ta.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boevink P, Oparka KJ | title = Virus-host interactions during movement processes | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 138 | issue = 4 | pages = 1815\u201321 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16172094 | pmc = 1183373 | doi = 10.1104/pp.105.066761 }}</ref> Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp. 243\u201359</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]].

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ([[retrovirus]]es) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes ([[dsDNA-RT virus|pararetrovirus]]es) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Viral genomes may be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT). In addition, ssRNA viruses may be either [[sense (molecular biology)|sense]] (+) or antisense (\u2212). This classification places viruses into seven groups:\n\n{{Baltimore groups}}\n\nAs an example of viral classification, the [[chicken pox]] virus, [[varicella zoster]] (VZV), belongs to the order ''[[Herpesvirales]]'', family ''[[Herpesviridae]]'', subfamily ''[[Alphaherpesvirinae]]'', and genus ''[[Varicellovirus]]''. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use reverse transcriptase.\n\nThe complete set of viruses in an organism or habitat is called the [[virome]]; for example, all human viruses constitute the [[human virome]].<ref name=\"pmid27698618\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Parker MT | title = An Ecological Framework of the Human Virome Provides Classification of Current Knowledge and Identifies Areas of Forthcoming Discovery | journal = The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 339\u201351 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27698618 | pmc = 5045143 | doi =  }}</ref>\n\n== Role in human disease ==\n{{See also|Viral disease}}\n[[File:Viral infections and involved species.png|thumb|alt=A photograph of the upper body of a man labelled with the names of viruses that infect the different parts|Overview of the main types of viral infection and the most notable species involved<ref name=\"Microbiology\">Mainly Chapter 33 (Disease summaries), pp. 367\u201392 in:{{cite book| last1 = Fisher | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Harvey | first2 = Richard P. | last3 = Champe | first3 =  Pamela C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology |series=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Hagerstwon, MD|year=2007|pages= 367\u201392|isbn=978-0-7817-8215-9}}</ref>]]\nExamples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], influenza, [[chickenpox]], and [[cold sores]].

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or ''virions'', consisting of: (i) the [[genetic material]], i.e. long [[molecule]]s of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, the ''[[capsid]]'', which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]] as they are one hundredth the size of most bacteria.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Rybicki EP |year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182\u201386}}</ref> and as [[Self-replication|replicators]].<ref name=\"pmid26965225\"/>\n\nViruses spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections. Several [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word is from the Latin neuter {{lang|la|v\u012brus}} referring to [[poison]] and other noxious liquids, from the same [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European base]] as [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|vi\u1e63a}}, [[Avestan]] {{lang|ae|v\u012b\u0161a}}, and [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f30\u03cc\u03c2}} (all meaning \"poison\"), first [[Attested language|attested]] in English in 1398 in [[John Trevisa|John Trevisa's]] translation of [[Bartholomeus Anglicus|Bartholomeus Anglicus's]] ''De Proprietatibus Rerum''.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virus, n. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\">{{cite web | title=virus | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virus|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> ''Virulent'', from Latin ''virulentus'' (poisonous), dates to c. 1400.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virulent, adj. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web \n|title=virulent | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virulent |access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> A meaning of \"agent that causes infectious disease\" is first recorded in 1728,<ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\" /> long before the discovery of viruses by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented.

All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-strand viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule\u2014a [[chemokine receptor]]\u2014which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated.

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ([[retrovirus]]es) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes ([[dsDNA-RT virus|pararetrovirus]]es) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

In addition, ssRNA viruses may be either [[sense (molecular biology)|sense]] (+) or antisense (\u2212).

From the viewpoint of a materials scientist, viruses can be regarded as organic nanoparticles.\nTheir surface carries specific tools which enable them to cross the barriers of their host cells. The size and shape of viruses and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.<ref name=\"fischlechner\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischlechner M, Donath E | title = Viruses as building blocks for materials and devices | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 46 | issue = 18 | pages = 3184\u201393 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17348058 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200603445 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of their size, shape, and well-defined chemical structures, viruses have been used as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale.
