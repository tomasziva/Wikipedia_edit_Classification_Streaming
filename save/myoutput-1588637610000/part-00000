Autopsy reports shown that Winnie was raped and strangled to death. After some police investigations, 25-year-old Joseph Michael Nonis was arrested and charged with her murder. At the trial which started on 24 October 1950, although he signed a confession and no need to go onto the stand, Nonis insisted to do so and revealed on the stand that he was innocent, and claimed he was tortured by Chief Inspector Rayney, who forced him to pen down and sign the confession of how he killed Winnie (He also testified he was afraid of Rayney who had tortured him before, and who had gained notoriety for having allegedly tortured and forced people into giving statements to the police during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]). The late [[David Saul Marshall|David Marshall]], who was Singapore's most reputed lawyer at that time and who was representing Nonis as his defence lawyer (Marshall would later on become the first [[Chief Minister of Singapore]]), called in witnesses who were formerly tortured by Rayney to testify. They confirmed Nonis's description of Rayney's treachery. All of Nonis's family members and acquaintances also testified that Nonis was seen at home on the same night when Winnie was murdered, which supported Nonis's alibi defence. A [[ psychiatrist]] was also called in to assess Nonis's character and the confession written by Nonis; the psychiatrist said on court that such a confession could only be written by an individual of [[psychopathic]] behaviour, and Nonis's true character did not fit that of a psychopath. After a trial lasting 9 days, in view of the evidence, the 7-men jury found Nonis not guilty of murder and as a result, Nonis was discharged and acquitted of murder, and walked out of the court a free man. As of today, the rape and murder of Winnie Spencer remains unsolved, and the murderer(s) were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|title=True Files S1|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s1/ep4/366912|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==1960s==\n===1963===\n* 12 July 1963: Among the 320  detainees at the prison on [[Pulau Senang]], a group of 70 to 90 inmates led by the ringleader and notorious gang leader Tan Kheng Ann (alias Robert Black), started a riot which destroyed and burned everything the inmates had built on Pulau Senang. During the riot, prison officer Daniel Stanley Dutton and his three assistants - Arumugam Veerasingham, Tan Kok Hian and Chok Kok Heng were murdered by some of the rioters, including Tan. Around 58 men were accused of murder and rioting (the others received jail terms for rioting).

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 May 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong from the back of the car, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to [[Malaysia]] before their arrest by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]]). Lee led the police to a manhole in [[Jurong]], where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Richard Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness against the three murder defendants, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, the fifth accomplice Chow Sien Cheong was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for another crime, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in 15 March 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal against his sentence was rejected by the [[Court of Appeal]], his appeal to the [[Privy Council]] in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act not amounting to culpable homicide. However, Yasin was brought back to court again and promptly charged with rape. At the trial on 11 May 1977, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and Harun's testimony against him. At the end of the trial on 12 May 1977, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and he was sentenced to serve another 8 years in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

Apparently, she fell to her death. However, when the forensic pathologist Seah Han Cheow examined her body, he found that the cause of Chua's death was strangulation (meaning that she was dead before her fall), and further autopsy reports shown that she was sexually assaulted before her death. 4 days later, 27-year-old labourer Lim Seng Chuan was arrested and charged with her murder. Although he signed a confession over how he raped and killed Chua, however, at the trial, Lim denied signing the confession and denied his crimes. On 27 June 1975, Lim was found guilty of Chua's murder and sentenced to death, but when Lim filed an appeal, his death sentence was set aside and he was granted a re-trial. At the re-trial on 2 November 1976, the prosecution proceeded with an amended charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as well as another amended charge of attempted rape (as there was inconclusive evidence of whether Lim had indeed raped her before her death, and whether Lim did intentionally murder Chua). At the end of the re-trial 4 days later, Lim Seng Chuan was found guilty of both charges and sentenced to 8 years' jail for killing Chua and a concurrent jail term of 4 years for attempted rape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s5/ep4/367538|title=True Files S5|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n\n===1975===\n* July 1975: District Judge E.C.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. The late senior forensic pathologist Professor [[Chao Tzee Cheng]] could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the state of decomposition, some body parts were missing and the injuries he found on the skull and ribs were not sufficient to cause death. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, the school bus driver even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his school bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner [[Amarjeet Singh]] concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh Laye Koh's appeal against his conviction was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n===1990===\n*10 October 1990: Italian immigrant Clementina Curci, who migrated to Singapore with her husband and two children, was found dead by her husband in a bathroom of her bungalow. Her death was a result of being immersed in water and strangulation. Three of the four cleaners hired by the Italian family to clean the house before and on the day of the murder itself, were questioned by the police. The fourth cleaner, Maksa bin Tohaiee, was not present at work on the day itself because he was sick. Nevertheless, the police still considered Maksa as one of their prime suspects and brought him in for questioning. But Maksa was released shortly after. A month later, when Maksa was brought to the CID again for further questioning, Maksa admitted that he had stolen some items from the bungalow before, and on the day of the murder separately, and that he was confronted by the victim when he broke into the house (without the cleaners noticing) to rob more items, resulting into a fight that led to the victim becoming unconscious from the strangulation. Maksa claimed he thought Curci was dead and out of panic, he quickly placed her body inside a bathtub full of water before fleeing the bungalow. Some of the stolen items were recovered, and Maksa was charged with the murder of Clementina Curci. Despite his confession, at the trial however, Maksa denied signing the confession (he claimed he was forced by the police to sign the confession), and tried to establish an alibi of him going to a clinic and resting at one of his siblings' flat on the day of the murder in his defence against the murder allegation. However, the testimonies given by Maksa's family members were all riddled with inconsistencies, resulting in Maksa failing to substantiate his alibi defence, which failed to raise a reasonable doubt over the prosecution's case. As such, on 25 November 1992, Maksa was found guilty and sentenced to death for the murder of Clementina Curci. After the dismissal of his appeal against his conviction and sentence, as well as the rejection of his plea for presidential clemency, Maksa was hanged on 26 November 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep4/367409|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to [[Mandai]], burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor [[Chao Tzee Cheng]] identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck (possibly by an axe or any other weapon) and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up an axe which Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"[[Whispers Of The Dead]]\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. Two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner [[Choo Han Teck]] accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice [[T. S. Sinnathuray]], who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, in the course of the appeal, Chief Justice [[Yong Pung How]] also decided that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. He also ruled that this amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, hence his life term remained as a 20-year jail sentence, and he would still be spending 38 years behind bars.<ref>{{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Her son, who discovered the body, contacted the police. The police then interviewed Sivapackiam's 36-year-old tenant and prostitute Andrew Gerardine, who told them that when she returned home from visit her son, a group of two men and a woman suddenly came to the flat, apparently intending to rob her and her landlady. According to Gerardine's statements, the trio restrained Sivapackiam and threatened her with a knife to look for valuables, but she was later told to leave after she failed to locate any valuables. With this information, the police arrested the three robbers; 23-year-old unemployed Mansoor Abdullah, 28-year-old coffee shop assistant Nazar Mohamed Kassim, and 22-year-old prostitute Kamala Rani Balakrishnan. All three admitted to the robbery, but they implicated Gerardine as the mastermind of the robbery. Gerardine later on confessed that she had indeed collborated with the three to rob and assault her landlady, due to problems between her and the landlady, as a way to \"teach her a lesson\". However, Gerardine insisted that she had no intention to cause her landlady's death. Nevertheless, she was charged with the murder of Sivapackiam, together with Mansoor and Nazar who both killed the landlady. In February 1998, the two men were condemned to hang for the murder, while Gerardine, who solicited the robbery that took her landlady's life, was instead sentenced to 8 years in prison for a reduced charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Gerardine's escape from the gallows was short-lived, as the prosecution filed an appeal against her conviction and sentence, arguing that Gerardine's actions was indirectly responsible for Sivapackiam's murder and raise many other key factors to prove that Gerardine was also guilty of murder as the other two men.

The victim, 50-year-old Tan Eng Yan, was violently murdered and she sustained 58 injuries in total (among these injuries, 4 of them were fatal); two of her hands were nearly chopped off. Not just that, SG$6,600 worth of coins and SG$2,200 worth of cash were missing from the flat. Tan, who worked as a fruit stallholder in Tampines, was suspected to have been murdered by someone known to her as there was no forced entry into the flat, and the killer was also apparently injured (as there was a trail of blood left behind outside the flat). With this information, over the next 5 days, the police questioned Tan's acquaintances from the market. One of them was a 46-year-old fishmonger named Lau Lee Peng. Lau, who was injured on his hands and feet, confessed to his police interrogators that he killed Tan and that he did not do it alone; he had an accomplice, only known as \"Ah Meng\", who helped to kill Tan. DNA tests confirmed there were some DNA belonging to a third unknown person in the flat other than Tan and Lau's, and the police thus set out a manhunt for Ah Meng. However, a few days after his arrest, Lau changed his story, claiming he lied to the police earlier on, saying that he did it alone and that there was no such person called \"Ah Meng\". As such, only Lau was charged with and stood trial for the murder of the fruit stall owner. The money stolen from the flat were later recovered by the police. Lau, who was known to be a heavy gambler and raked up huge debts from gambling, seemed to have a motive to murder Tan due to his knowledge of Tan possessing a lot of money (Tan was known to always flaunting her wealth to people around her), and his desperate need to pay off his debts. Having failed to substantiate his defences of a grave and sudden provocation and of a sudden fight respectively, and also due to the inconsistencies in his police statements and court testimonies, Lau Lee Peng was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 12 November 1999. Lau failed in his bid to escape the gallows when his appeal against the sentence was dismissed in March 2000, and he was eventually hanged on 1 September 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s1/ep12/366933|title=True Files S1|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>\n\n===1999===\n*21 April 1999: From her bedroom window of her house in Phoenix Garden, Fairos Banu witnessed her stepfather T. Maniam, a 55-year-old retired police inspector, being beaten to death by two Indian men. This brutal killing was also witnessed by two other people; a maid named Aurea David and her employer Geraldine Tan Poh Choo. Fairos recognised one of the attackers as her mother's 25-year-old boyfriend and Indian national Loganatha Venkatesan. Both Venkatesan and Chandran Rajagopal, the other man seen beating Maniam to death, were subsequently arrested and charged with murder. Maniam's second wife and Fairos's 51-year-old mother Julaiha Begum was also arrested for her alleged involvement in the plot to murder her husband to gain full ownership of the house and full possession of the proceeds from the sale of the house. According to Fairos and her younger sister Sairah (Maniam's younger stepdaughter) at the early phase of the trial, it was revealed there were bitter conflicts between Maniam and their mother over Julaiha's share of the ownership of the house and her share of the money gained from selling the house, Julaiha's affair with Venkatesan and many other factors. This would eventually accumulate into Julaiha plotting with Venkatesan, Chandran and another accomplice, Govindasamy Ravichandran (who would later on become the prosecution's key witness against all the three defendants at the trial) in killing her husband. The three men later hired a truck driver, only known as Mani, to drive them to Maniam's house in order to carry out the murder. After two failed attempts to kill Maniam, Ravichandran backed out of the plan due to his reluctance to carry out the murder and him worrying about his family, and fled to India after he stole some money from Chandran. This ultimately made Venkatesan to join in their third attempt and they managed to kill Maniam. At the trial, both Venkatesan and Chandran denied killing Maniam and blamed Mani for doing so, while Julaiha denied her involvement in the murder, denied having an affair with Venkatesan, and attempting to discredit the testimonies made against her by her own daughters and Ravichandran. Nevertheless, on 14 March 2000, the three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging.

The identity of the deceased was later ascertained to be 26-year-old Bangladeshi worker Farhad Hossain. Two days later, Farhad's 34-year-old friend and fellow worker Abdul Based Late Nasin Uddin was arrested and charged with his murder. The head was found soon after Based's arrest, and autopsy reports showed that Farhad's head was chopped off by a heavy and sharp object (possibly a [[parang]] or a [[chopper]]{{dn|date=May 2020}}) and the severe cracks on the skull suggest that someone must have used a large amount of force to hack at Farhad's head severely with the same aforementioned possible murder weapon. At Based's trial in April 2001, the prosecution attempted to prove that Based had a motive to kill Farhad by presenting a previous conflict between Based and the victim over money problems which caused both their friendship to deteriorate. One of the prosecution's key evidences to prove its case against Based was the bloodstained shirt he wore when he was arrested. However, when he was called to the stand to make his defence, Based was able to prove that he had an alibi at the time of the murder and that the bloodstains found on the shirt were tested and found to be animal blood, not human; and the shirt itself actually belonged to a butcher and a friend of Based's whom Based visited and exchanged shirts with before his arrest. As such, after some deliberation over the evidence, testimonies and submissions made by both sides, Judicial Commissioner Chan Seng Onn decided that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, and accepted Based's defence of an alibi, hence he acquitted Based of murder and discharged him. As of today, the case remains unsolved, and the murderer(s) were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s4/ep5/367548|title=True Files S4|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>\n* 8/26 August 2000: Three men: 34-year-old Wan Kamil Mohamed Shafian, 35-year-old Ibrahim Mohamed and 30-year-old Rosli Ahmat decided to commit robberies using weapons and firearms they had bought.

Furious, the 26-year-old Malaysian stepped out of the car and went to find the man who hit his car, but he could only find the man's companion. The other man did not seemed to respond to Tan's furious words and continued walking (this seemingly deliberate and apparent indifference only infuriated Tan further) until Tan caught his attention and made him turn around. Tan angrily asked the man, demanding to know why his friend hit his car window. But the man did not respond, and he pushed Tan down onto the ground before making his way. Provoked by this action, Tan picked up a stick he saw next to him from the ground and used it to hit the man once on the head and hit him many times (mostly on the man's haversack) even when the man has collapsed due to loss of consciousness. Tan only stopped after the man stopped moving and left for Malaysia in his car, with the belief that the man was still alive (as he could still hear him breathing before he left). Unknown to Tan, the first blow he inflicted on the man's head turned out to be fatal, and the victim, 44-year-old Krishnan Sengal Rajah, died as a result. What was more shocking to Tan was when he received news of the man's death, he found out that Krishnan was a deaf-mute, which explained why he did not seem to respond to Tan or seem to ignore his words. 10 months later, Tan Chun Seng was arrested in April 2002 in Malaysia, and he was charged with the murder of Krishnan. At the trial in early 2003, Tan Chun Seng failed to substantiate his defence of sudden and grave provocation against the murder charge and he was sentenced to death for killing the deaf-mute victim. Tan filed an appeal against the sentence, and veteran lawyer [[Subhas Anandan]], who represented Tan in his appeal, raised the huge disparity in terms of height and size between Tan and the apparently larger-sized and taller victim; the heat of the moment where the victim had started a brief sudden fight with Tan by pushing Tan onto the ground, leading to Tan picking up the stick in an uncontrollable fit of anger to hit the victim; the lack of any undue advantage Tan had against Krishnan, as well as other factors vital to Tan in his defence of a sudden fight against the murder allegation. After hearing the appeal, on 20 May 2003, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, amending the murder conviction to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Consequently, Tan's death sentence was then commuted to a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for the killing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s4/ep7/367568|title=True Files S4|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n*10 August 2001: A day before the wedding of 33-year-old businessman Tay Teng Joo, he was kidnapped by 45-year-old Chng Teo Heng together with the assistance of his accomplices, 52-year-old businesswoman Agnes Ng Lei Eng and 42-year-old freelance painter Ng Soon Teck.

The girl's neighbours, and some strangers joined in the search. 3 days later, on 4 March, 29-year-old Mohammed Ali bin Johari, the girl's stepfather, suddenly broke down and tearfully confessed to his wife and mother that he had accidentally killed Nonoi by drowning her in a pail of water, shocking everyone. Ali then led the police to the Aljunied Flyover along the [[Pan Island Expressway]], where Nonoi's partially decomposed body was found at the lowest portion of the flyover. Ali was then charged with his stepdaughter's murder. Autopsy results found sexual injuries on the girl, suggesting that the girl was sexually assaulted before her death. Nonoi's lungs were also found waterlogged, consistent with being drowned or immersed in water. Ali maintained that he did not rape the girl and would never do it as he loved Nonoi like his own flesh and blood, and that he immersed the girl in water with the purpose of merely wanting to stop her from crying (he told the police and court that Nonoi, for some reason, kept crying on the day itself and did not stop). Ali also argued he did not intend to kill her, and accidentally immersed Nonoi in water for a longer period of time after doing so two times while picking up an incoming phone call. However, the phone records showed no evidence of Ali taking any phone calls on the day of the murder, and there were inconsistencies in his police statements and court testimonies. Although there were two other possible reasons behind the girl's death, Justice [[Kan Ting Chiu]] ruled that Nonoi died from the effects of the immersions (he felt that there were insufficient evidence to support the two possibilities behind Nonoi's death), and decided that Ali had intentionally kept his stepdaughter immersed in water for a long period of time and it was not an accident. Therefore, on 31 August 2007, 31-year-old Mohammed Ali bin Johari was sentenced to death for murdering his stepdaughter. Ali's appeal against the sentence failed, and on the morning of 19 December 2008, Ali was hanged in [[Changi Prison]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/guilty-as-charged-man-dunked-stepdaughter-nonoi-2-in-pail-of-water-killing|title=Guilty As Charged: Man dunked stepdaughter Nonoi, 2, in pail of water, killing her|last=Hussain|first=Amir|date=2016-05-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> \n*June 2006: Lawyer David Rasif fled with S$11.3 million of his clients' money, one of the largest amount misappropriated by a rogue Singaporean lawyer.

Autopsy reports shown that Winnie was raped and strangled to death. After some police investigations, 25-year-old Joseph Michael Nonis was arrested and charged with her murder. At the trial which started on 24 October 1950, although he signed a confession and no need to go onto the stand, Nonis insisted to do so and revealed on the stand that he was innocent, and claimed he was tortured by Chief Inspector Rayney, who forced him to pen down and sign the confession of how he killed Winnie (He also testified he was afraid of Rayney who had tortured him before, and who had gained notoriety for having allegedly tortured and forced people into giving statements to the police during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]). The late [[David Saul Marshall|David Marshall]], who was Singapore's most reputed lawyer at that time and who was representing Nonis as his defence lawyer (Marshall would later on become the first [[Chief Minister of Singapore]]), called in witnesses who were formerly tortured by Rayney to testify. They confirmed Nonis's description of Rayney's treachery. All of Nonis's family members and acquaintances also testified that Nonis was seen at home on the same night when Winnie was murdered, which supported Nonis's alibi defence. A [[ psychiatrist]] was also called in to assess Nonis's character and the confession written by Nonis; the psychiatrist said on court that such a confession could only be written by an individual of [[psychopathic]] behaviour, and Nonis's true character did not fit that of a psychopath. After a trial lasting 9 days, in view of the evidence, the 7-men jury found Nonis not guilty of murder and as a result, Nonis was discharged and acquitted of murder, and walked out of the court a free man. As of today, the rape and murder of Winnie Spencer remains unsolved, and the murderer(s) were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|title=True Files S1|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s1/ep4/366912|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==1960s==\n===1963===\n* 12 July 1963: Among the 320  detainees at the prison on [[Pulau Senang]], a group of 70 to 90 inmates led by the ringleader and notorious gang leader Tan Kheng Ann (alias Robert Black), started a riot which destroyed and burned everything the inmates had built on Pulau Senang. During the riot, prison officer Daniel Stanley Dutton and his three assistants - Arumugam Veerasingham, Tan Kok Hian and Chok Kok Heng were murdered by some of the rioters, including Tan.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 May 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong from the back of the car, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to [[Malaysia]] before their arrest by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]]). Lee led the police to a manhole in [[Jurong]], where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Richard Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness against the three murder defendants, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, the fifth accomplice Chow Sien Cheong was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for another crime, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in 15 March 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal against his sentence was rejected by the [[Court of Appeal]], his appeal to the [[Privy Council]] in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act not amounting to culpable homicide. However, Yasin was brought back to court again and promptly charged with rape. At the trial on 11 May 1977, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and Harun's testimony against him.

Apparently, she fell to her death. However, when the forensic pathologist Seah Han Cheow examined her body, he found that the cause of Chua's death was strangulation (meaning that she was dead before her fall), and further autopsy reports shown that she was sexually assaulted before her death. 4 days later, 27-year-old labourer Lim Seng Chuan was arrested and charged with her murder. Although he signed a confession over how he raped and killed Chua, however, at the trial, Lim denied signing the confession and denied his crimes. On 27 June 1975, Lim was found guilty of Chua's murder and sentenced to death, but when Lim filed an appeal, his death sentence was set aside and he was granted a re-trial. At the re-trial on 2 November 1976, the prosecution proceeded with an amended charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as well as another amended charge of attempted rape (as there was inconclusive evidence of whether Lim had indeed raped her before her death, and whether Lim did intentionally murder Chua).

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. The late senior forensic pathologist Professor [[Chao Tzee Cheng]] could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the state of decomposition, some body parts were missing and the injuries he found on the skull and ribs were not sufficient to cause death. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, the school bus driver even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his school bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner [[Amarjeet Singh]] concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh Laye Koh's appeal against his conviction was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n===1990===\n*10 October 1990: Italian immigrant Clementina Curci, who migrated to Singapore with her husband and two children, was found dead by her husband in a bathroom of her bungalow. Her death was a result of being immersed in water and strangulation. Three of the four cleaners hired by the Italian family to clean the house before and on the day of the murder itself, were questioned by the police. The fourth cleaner, Maksa bin Tohaiee, was not present at work on the day itself because he was sick. Nevertheless, the police still considered Maksa as one of their prime suspects and brought him in for questioning. But Maksa was released shortly after. A month later, when Maksa was brought to the CID again for further questioning, Maksa admitted that he had stolen some items from the bungalow before, and on the day of the murder separately, and that he was confronted by the victim when he broke into the house (without the cleaners noticing) to rob more items, resulting into a fight that led to the victim becoming unconscious from the strangulation. Maksa claimed he thought Curci was dead and out of panic, he quickly placed her body inside a bathtub full of water before fleeing the bungalow. Some of the stolen items were recovered, and Maksa was charged with the murder of Clementina Curci. Despite his confession, at the trial however, Maksa denied signing the confession (he claimed he was forced by the police to sign the confession), and tried to establish an alibi of him going to a clinic and resting at one of his siblings' flat on the day of the murder in his defence against the murder allegation. However, the testimonies given by Maksa's family members were all riddled with inconsistencies, resulting in Maksa failing to substantiate his alibi defence, which failed to raise a reasonable doubt over the prosecution's case. As such, on 25 November 1992, Maksa was found guilty and sentenced to death for the murder of Clementina Curci. After the dismissal of his appeal against his conviction and sentence, as well as the rejection of his plea for presidential clemency, Maksa was hanged on 26 November 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep4/367409|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to [[Mandai]], burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor [[Chao Tzee Cheng]] identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck (possibly by an axe or any other weapon) and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up an axe which Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"[[Whispers Of The Dead]]\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. Two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner [[Choo Han Teck]] accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice [[T. S. Sinnathuray]], who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, in the course of the appeal, Chief Justice [[Yong Pung How]] also decided that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. He also ruled that this amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, hence his life term remained as a 20-year jail sentence, and he would still be spending 38 years behind bars.<ref>{{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Her son, who discovered the body, contacted the police. The police then interviewed Sivapackiam's 36-year-old tenant and prostitute Andrew Gerardine, who told them that when she returned home from visit her son, a group of two men and a woman suddenly came to the flat, apparently intending to rob her and her landlady. According to Gerardine's statements, the trio restrained Sivapackiam and threatened her with a knife to look for valuables, but she was later told to leave after she failed to locate any valuables. With this information, the police arrested the three robbers; 23-year-old unemployed Mansoor Abdullah, 28-year-old coffee shop assistant Nazar Mohamed Kassim, and 22-year-old prostitute Kamala Rani Balakrishnan. All three admitted to the robbery, but they implicated Gerardine as the mastermind of the robbery. Gerardine later on confessed that she had indeed collborated with the three to rob and assault her landlady, due to problems between her and the landlady, as a way to \"teach her a lesson\". However, Gerardine insisted that she had no intention to cause her landlady's death. Nevertheless, she was charged with the murder of Sivapackiam, together with Mansoor and Nazar who both killed the landlady. In February 1998, the two men were condemned to hang for the murder, while Gerardine, who solicited the robbery that took her landlady's life, was instead sentenced to 8 years in prison for a reduced charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Gerardine's escape from the gallows was short-lived, as the prosecution filed an appeal against her conviction and sentence, arguing that Gerardine's actions was indirectly responsible for Sivapackiam's murder and raise many other key factors to prove that Gerardine was also guilty of murder as the other two men.

The victim, 50-year-old Tan Eng Yan, was violently murdered and she sustained 58 injuries in total (among these injuries, 4 of them were fatal); two of her hands were nearly chopped off. Not just that, SG$6,600 worth of coins and SG$2,200 worth of cash were missing from the flat. Tan, who worked as a fruit stallholder in Tampines, was suspected to have been murdered by someone known to her as there was no forced entry into the flat, and the killer was also apparently injured (as there was a trail of blood left behind outside the flat). With this information, over the next 5 days, the police questioned Tan's acquaintances from the market. One of them was a 46-year-old fishmonger named Lau Lee Peng. Lau, who was injured on his hands and feet, confessed to his police interrogators that he killed Tan and that he did not do it alone; he had an accomplice, only known as \"Ah Meng\", who helped to kill Tan. DNA tests confirmed there were some DNA belonging to a third unknown person in the flat other than Tan and Lau's, and the police thus set out a manhunt for Ah Meng. However, a few days after his arrest, Lau changed his story, claiming he lied to the police earlier on, saying that he did it alone and that there was no such person called \"Ah Meng\". As such, only Lau was charged with and stood trial for the murder of the fruit stall owner. The money stolen from the flat were later recovered by the police. Lau, who was known to be a heavy gambler and raked up huge debts from gambling, seemed to have a motive to murder Tan due to his knowledge of Tan possessing a lot of money (Tan was known to always flaunting her wealth to people around her), and his desperate need to pay off his debts. Having failed to substantiate his defences of a grave and sudden provocation and of a sudden fight respectively, and also due to the inconsistencies in his police statements and court testimonies, Lau Lee Peng was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 12 November 1999. Lau failed in his bid to escape the gallows when his appeal against the sentence was dismissed in March 2000, and he was eventually hanged on 1 September 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s1/ep12/366933|title=True Files S1|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>\n\n===1999===\n*21 April 1999: From her bedroom window of her house in Phoenix Garden, Fairos Banu witnessed her stepfather T. Maniam, a 55-year-old retired police inspector, being beaten to death by two Indian men. This brutal killing was also witnessed by two other people; a maid named Aurea David and her employer Geraldine Tan Poh Choo. Fairos recognised one of the attackers as her mother's 25-year-old boyfriend and Indian national Loganatha Venkatesan. Both Venkatesan and Chandran Rajagopal, the other man seen beating Maniam to death, were subsequently arrested and charged with murder. Maniam's second wife and Fairos's 51-year-old mother Julaiha Begum was also arrested for her alleged involvement in the plot to murder her husband to gain full ownership of the house and full possession of the proceeds from the sale of the house. According to Fairos and her younger sister Sairah (Maniam's younger stepdaughter) at the early phase of the trial, it was revealed there were bitter conflicts between Maniam and their mother over Julaiha's share of the ownership of the house and her share of the money gained from selling the house, Julaiha's affair with Venkatesan and many other factors. This would eventually accumulate into Julaiha plotting with Venkatesan, Chandran and another accomplice, Govindasamy Ravichandran (who would later on become the prosecution's key witness against all the three defendants at the trial) in killing her husband. The three men later hired a truck driver, only known as Mani, to drive them to Maniam's house in order to carry out the murder. After two failed attempts to kill Maniam, Ravichandran backed out of the plan due to his reluctance to carry out the murder and him worrying about his family, and fled to India after he stole some money from Chandran. This ultimately made Venkatesan to join in their third attempt and they managed to kill Maniam. At the trial, both Venkatesan and Chandran denied killing Maniam and blamed Mani for doing so, while Julaiha denied her involvement in the murder, denied having an affair with Venkatesan, and attempting to discredit the testimonies made against her by her own daughters and Ravichandran. Nevertheless, on 14 March 2000, the three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging.

The identity of the deceased was later ascertained to be 26-year-old Bangladeshi worker Farhad Hossain. Two days later, Farhad's 34-year-old friend and fellow worker Abdul Based Late Nasin Uddin was arrested and charged with his murder. The head was found soon after Based's arrest, and autopsy reports showed that Farhad's head was chopped off by a heavy and sharp object (possibly a [[parang]] or a [[chopper]]{{dn|date=May 2020}}) and the severe cracks on the skull suggest that someone must have used a large amount of force to hack at Farhad's head severely with the same aforementioned possible murder weapon. At Based's trial in April 2001, the prosecution attempted to prove that Based had a motive to kill Farhad by presenting a previous conflict between Based and the victim over money problems which caused both their friendship to deteriorate. One of the prosecution's key evidences to prove its case against Based was the bloodstained shirt he wore when he was arrested. However, when he was called to the stand to make his defence, Based was able to prove that he had an alibi at the time of the murder and that the bloodstains found on the shirt were tested and found to be animal blood, not human; and the shirt itself actually belonged to a butcher and a friend of Based's whom Based visited and exchanged shirts with before his arrest. As such, after some deliberation over the evidence, testimonies and submissions made by both sides, Judicial Commissioner Chan Seng Onn decided that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, and accepted Based's defence of an alibi, hence he acquitted Based of murder and discharged him. As of today, the case remains unsolved, and the murderer(s) were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s4/ep5/367548|title=True Files S4|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>\n* 8/26 August 2000: Three men: 34-year-old Wan Kamil Mohamed Shafian, 35-year-old Ibrahim Mohamed and 30-year-old Rosli Ahmat decided to commit robberies using weapons and firearms they had bought.

Furious, the 26-year-old Malaysian stepped out of the car and went to find the man who hit his car, but he could only find the man's companion. The other man did not seemed to respond to Tan's furious words and continued walking (this seemingly deliberate and apparent indifference only infuriated Tan further) until Tan caught his attention and made him turn around. Tan angrily asked the man, demanding to know why his friend hit his car window. But the man did not respond, and he pushed Tan down onto the ground before making his way. Provoked by this action, Tan picked up a stick he saw next to him from the ground and used it to hit the man once on the head and hit him many times (mostly on the man's haversack) even when the man has collapsed due to loss of consciousness. Tan only stopped after the man stopped moving and left for Malaysia in his car, with the belief that the man was still alive (as he could still hear him breathing before he left). Unknown to Tan, the first blow he inflicted on the man's head turned out to be fatal, and the victim, 44-year-old Krishnan Sengal Rajah, died as a result. What was more shocking to Tan was when he received news of the man's death, he found out that Krishnan was a deaf-mute, which explained why he did not seem to respond to Tan or seem to ignore his words. 10 months later, Tan Chun Seng was arrested in April 2002 in Malaysia, and he was charged with the murder of Krishnan. At the trial in early 2003, Tan Chun Seng failed to substantiate his defence of sudden and grave provocation against the murder charge and he was sentenced to death for killing the deaf-mute victim. Tan filed an appeal against the sentence, and veteran lawyer [[Subhas Anandan]], who represented Tan in his appeal, raised the huge disparity in terms of height and size between Tan and the apparently larger-sized and taller victim; the heat of the moment where the victim had started a brief sudden fight with Tan by pushing Tan onto the ground, leading to Tan picking up the stick in an uncontrollable fit of anger to hit the victim; the lack of any undue advantage Tan had against Krishnan, as well as other factors vital to Tan in his defence of a sudden fight against the murder allegation. After hearing the appeal, on 20 May 2003, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, amending the murder conviction to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Consequently, Tan's death sentence was then commuted to a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for the killing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s4/ep7/367568|title=True Files S4|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n*10 August 2001: A day before the wedding of 33-year-old businessman Tay Teng Joo, he was kidnapped by 45-year-old Chng Teo Heng together with the assistance of his accomplices, 52-year-old businesswoman Agnes Ng Lei Eng and 42-year-old freelance painter Ng Soon Teck.

The girl's neighbours, and some strangers joined in the search. 3 days later, on 4 March, 29-year-old Mohammed Ali bin Johari, the girl's stepfather, suddenly broke down and tearfully confessed to his wife and mother that he had accidentally killed Nonoi by drowning her in a pail of water, shocking everyone. Ali then led the police to the Aljunied Flyover along the [[Pan Island Expressway]], where Nonoi's partially decomposed body was found at the lowest portion of the flyover. Ali was then charged with his stepdaughter's murder. Autopsy results found sexual injuries on the girl, suggesting that the girl was sexually assaulted before her death. Nonoi's lungs were also found waterlogged, consistent with being drowned or immersed in water. Ali maintained that he did not rape the girl and would never do it as he loved Nonoi like his own flesh and blood, and that he immersed the girl in water with the purpose of merely wanting to stop her from crying (he told the police and court that Nonoi, for some reason, kept crying on the day itself and did not stop). Ali also argued he did not intend to kill her, and accidentally immersed Nonoi in water for a longer period of time after doing so two times while picking up an incoming phone call. However, the phone records showed no evidence of Ali taking any phone calls on the day of the murder, and there were inconsistencies in his police statements and court testimonies. Although there were two other possible reasons behind the girl's death, Justice [[Kan Ting Chiu]] ruled that Nonoi died from the effects of the immersions (he felt that there were insufficient evidence to support the two possibilities behind Nonoi's death), and decided that Ali had intentionally kept his stepdaughter immersed in water for a long period of time and it was not an accident. Therefore, on 31 August 2007, 31-year-old Mohammed Ali bin Johari was sentenced to death for murdering his stepdaughter. Ali's appeal against the sentence failed, and on the morning of 19 December 2008, Ali was hanged in [[Changi Prison]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/guilty-as-charged-man-dunked-stepdaughter-nonoi-2-in-pail-of-water-killing|title=Guilty As Charged: Man dunked stepdaughter Nonoi, 2, in pail of water, killing her|last=Hussain|first=Amir|date=2016-05-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> \n*June 2006: Lawyer David Rasif fled with S$11.3 million of his clients' money, one of the largest amount misappropriated by a rogue Singaporean lawyer.
