In stimulating the body's [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]], they help prevent sickness from an [[infectious disease]].

Two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox and the disease did not develop. In 1798 Jenner published ''An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vacciniae'' which created widespread interest. He distinguished 'true' and 'spurious' cowpox (which did not give the desired effect) and developed an \"arm-to-arm\" method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual's pustule. Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox, but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material, by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100,000 people were vaccinated.<ref name=\"GrossSepkowitz\" /> The term ''vaccination'' was coined in 1800 by the surgeon Richard Dunning in his text ''Some observations on vaccination''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.lib.harvard.edu/contagion/catalog/36-990061255320203941|title=Some observations on vaccination, or, The inoculated cow-pox ; Some observations on vaccination ; Inoculated cow-pox ; Observations, & c ; Observations, &c|website=Contagion - CURIOSity Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nSince then vaccination campaigns have spread throughout the globe, sometimes prescribed by law or regulations (See [[Vaccination Act]]s). Vaccines are now used against a wide variety of diseases.  [[Louis Pasteur]] further developed the technique during the 19th century, extending its use to killed agents protecting against [[anthrax disease|anthrax]] and [[rabies]].  The method Pasteur used entailed treating the agents for those diseases so they lost the ability to infect, whereas inoculation was the hopeful selection of a less virulent form of the disease, and Jenner's vaccination entailed the substitution of a different and less dangerous disease.  Pasteur adopted the name ''vaccine'' as a generic term in honour of Jenner's discovery.\n\n[[Maurice Hilleman]] was the most prolific vaccine inventor, developing successful vaccines for [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B]], [[chickenpox]], [[meningitis]], [[pneumonia]] and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.<ref name=\"Vaccinated\">{{cite book |last=Offit |first=Paul A. |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |authorlink=Paul Offit|location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=978-0-06-122796-7 |year=2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, the first vaccine-preventable disease targeted for eradication was smallpox.

Studies have shown that the ratios of vaccination benefits to costs can differ substantially\u2014from 27:1 for diphtheria/pertussis, to 13.5:1 for measles, 4.76:1 for varicella, and 0.68\u20131.1 : 1 for pneumococcal conjugate.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some governments choose to subsidize the costs of vaccines, due to some of the high ROI values attributed to vaccinations. The United States subsidizes over half of all vaccines for children, which costs between $400 and $600 each. Although most children do get vaccinated, the adult population of the USA is still below the recommended immunization levels. Many factors can be attributed to this issue. Many adults who have other health conditions are unable to be safely immunized, whereas others opt not to be immunized for the sake of private financial benefits. Many Americans are underinsured, and, as such, are required to pay for vaccines out-of-pocket. Others are responsible for paying high deductibles and co-pays. Although vaccinations usually induce long-term economic benefits, many governments struggle to pay the high short-term costs associated with labor and production. Consequently, many countries neglect to provide such services.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]] published a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2018 which estimated the costs of developing vaccines for diseases that could escalate into global humanitarian crises.

Two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox and the disease did not develop. In 1798 Jenner published ''An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vacciniae'' which created widespread interest. He distinguished 'true' and 'spurious' cowpox (which did not give the desired effect) and developed an \"arm-to-arm\" method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual's pustule. Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox, but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material, by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100,000 people were vaccinated.<ref name=\"GrossSepkowitz\" /> The term ''vaccination'' was coined in 1800 by the surgeon Richard Dunning in his text ''Some observations on vaccination''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.lib.harvard.edu/contagion/catalog/36-990061255320203941|title=Some observations on vaccination, or, The inoculated cow-pox ; Some observations on vaccination ; Inoculated cow-pox ; Observations, & c ; Observations, &c|website=Contagion - CURIOSity Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nSince then vaccination campaigns have spread throughout the globe, sometimes prescribed by law or regulations (See [[Vaccination Act]]s). Vaccines are now used against a wide variety of diseases.  [[Louis Pasteur]] further developed the technique during the 19th century, extending its use to killed agents protecting against [[anthrax disease|anthrax]] and [[rabies]].  The method Pasteur used entailed treating the agents for those diseases so they lost the ability to infect, whereas inoculation was the hopeful selection of a less virulent form of the disease, and Jenner's vaccination entailed the substitution of a different and less dangerous disease.  Pasteur adopted the name ''vaccine'' as a generic term in honour of Jenner's discovery.\n\n[[Maurice Hilleman]] was the most prolific vaccine inventor, developing successful vaccines for [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B]], [[chickenpox]], [[meningitis]], [[pneumonia]] and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.<ref name=\"Vaccinated\">{{cite book |last=Offit |first=Paul A. |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |authorlink=Paul Offit|location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=978-0-06-122796-7 |year=2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, the first vaccine-preventable disease targeted for eradication was smallpox.

Studies have shown that the ratios of vaccination benefits to costs can differ substantially\u2014from 27:1 for diphtheria/pertussis, to 13.5:1 for measles, 4.76:1 for varicella, and 0.68\u20131.1 : 1 for pneumococcal conjugate.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some governments choose to subsidize the costs of vaccines, due to some of the high ROI values attributed to vaccinations. The United States subsidizes over half of all vaccines for children, which costs between $400 and $600 each. Although most children do get vaccinated, the adult population of the USA is still below the recommended immunization levels. Many factors can be attributed to this issue. Many adults who have other health conditions are unable to be safely immunized, whereas others opt not to be immunized for the sake of private financial benefits. Many Americans are underinsured, and, as such, are required to pay for vaccines out-of-pocket. Others are responsible for paying high deductibles and co-pays. Although vaccinations usually induce long-term economic benefits, many governments struggle to pay the high short-term costs associated with labor and production. Consequently, many countries neglect to provide such services.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]] published a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2018 which estimated the costs of developing vaccines for diseases that could escalate into global humanitarian crises.

This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak. The 2003 SARS outbreak in East Asia cost $54 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientists have estimated the cost of stopping 11 diseases that could kill millions in a pandemic |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17999676/vaccine-ebola-pandemic-disease-zika-epidemic-sars?platform=hootsuite |access-date=2 December 2018 |publisher=Vox |date=22 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Jenner phipps 01.jpg|Dr Jenner performing his first vaccination on [[James Phipps]], a boy of age 8.
