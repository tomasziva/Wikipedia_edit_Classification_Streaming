Team Liquid dropped the first two games of the series, and on the brink of elimination Liquid picked up three straight wins to beat TSM in the best of 5 series thus earning Doublelift his 6th championship and 3rd straight title win. Despite coming off of a strong performance in the Spring playoffs, Team Liquid struggled initially in the group stage of MSI 2019, but with a strong finish to the group stage they secured a 4th place seeding in the playoffs. This marked the first time Doublelift making it out of groups stage at an international tournament. In a surprising upset, the 4th seeded Team Liquid defeated the defending world champions, Invictus Gaming, in a four game series. Team Liquid advanced to the finals to face G2 Esports, where they were ultimately defeated in a 3-0 sweep.\n\nAfter a disappointing finish to MSI 2019, Liquid started out the 2019 LCS Summer Split with a poor 2-2 start, tying them for 4th place. However, they regained their footing managing to take sole ownership of first in a few short weeks. They once again finished atop the LCS with a 14-4 record. In the summer playoffs, Liquid beat Clutch Gaming in a close five games series to secure their place at Worlds 2019. They advanced to the summer finals where they met the second seeded Cloud9. It was a tightly contested series with Liquid winning the first game of the series, but dropping the next two to Cloud9. Liquid managed to turn the tables and win games 4 and 5 to secure their 4th straight LCS trophy and Doublelift his 7th championship overall. This win made Doublelift the player with the most titles in NA LCS history. At Worlds 2019 Liquid had a lackluster 3-3 performance which led to them once again being eliminated in the group stage.\n\n=== 2020 ===\nWith their premature exit from Worlds, Liquid parted ways with their jungler, Xmithie and signed former Fnatic Jungler, Broxah. Prior to the start of the spring 2020 split, Broxah had visa issues preventing him from joining them for the start of the spring season. Team Liquid performed very poorly, a far cry from their domination of the years prior. Midway through the split, Doublelift was benched in favor of Team Liquid Academy ADC Tactical. According Doublelift, this decision stemmed from his apparent lack of motivation to begin the 2020 spring split. Doublelift publicly apologized to his teammates for his attitude, and promised to work harder to return to the LCS stage. Doublelift returned to the starting lineup the following week, but ultimately Liquid finished the split in 9th place and did not make 2020 Spring Playoffs.\n\nWith a disappointing finish to Spring 2020, Team Liquid traded Doublelift to Team Solo Mid for the 2020 Summer Split.\n\n==Personal Life==\nPeng was born on July 19, 1993, and grew up in [[Mission Viejo]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.ongamers.com/videos/doublelifts-birthday-talks-crazy-c9-match-and-gift/2300-1234/|title=Doublelift's Birthday: Talks Crazy C9 Match and Gifts From Fans|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=July 20, 2015|access-date=2015-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126063500/http://www.ongamers.com/videos/doublelifts-birthday-talks-crazy-c9-match-and-gift/2300-1234/|archive-date=November 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He has a younger and an older brother.

A tightly contested regular season saw Team Liquid come out with the number one seed by only a single game over Cloud9, qualifying them for a bye in the first round and a guaranteed spot in the semi-finals. Matched up against 100 Thieves, Doublelift and Team liquid cruised to a 3-1 series victory to move on to a spot in the finals against Cloud9. On the eve of the NA LCS finals, Doublelift was awarded a long-awaited NA LCS MVP for the summer split. This was his first MVP award.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/doublelift-takes-home-the-2018-na-lcs-summer-split-mvp|title=Doublelift takes home the 2018 NA LCS Summer Split MVP|last=Chang|first=Brian|date=Sep 8, 2018|publisher=Dot Esports|accessdate=Sep 8, 2018}}</ref> Armed with the recently crowned MVP, Team Liquid easily defeated Cloud9 3-0 in the finals to capture back to back North American LCS titles and become the face of North American hopes heading into Worlds 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lolesports.com/en_US/na-lcs/na_2018_summer/standings/playoffs|title=LoL Esports|website=www.lolesports.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> However, they were eliminated in the group stage by KT Rolster and Edward Gaming.\n\n=== 2019 ===\nFresh out of a group stage exit at Worlds 2018, Team Liquid announced the signing of Jensen and former world champion CoreJJ to the midlane and support positions respectively. With their newly revamped roster, Team Liquid finished 14-4 on the 2019 Spring Split advancing to the Spring finals to face Doublelift's former team TSM. Team Liquid dropped the first two games of the series, and on the brink of elimination Liquid picked up three straight wins to beat TSM in the best of 5 series thus earning Doublelift his 6th championship and 3rd straight title win. Despite coming off of a strong performance in the Spring playoffs, Team Liquid struggled initially in the group stage of MSI 2019, but with a strong finish to the group stage they secured a 4th place seeding in the playoffs. This marked the first time Doublelift making it out of groups stage at an international tournament. In a surprising upset, the 4th seeded Team Liquid defeated the defending world champions, Invictus Gaming, in a four game series. Team Liquid advanced to the finals to face G2 Esports, where they were ultimately defeated in a 3-0 sweep.\n\nAfter a disappointing finish to MSI 2019, Liquid started out the 2019 LCS Summer Split with a poor 2-2 start, tying them for 4th place. However, they regained their footing managing to take sole ownership of first in a few short weeks. They once again finished atop the LCS with a 14-4 record. In the summer playoffs, Liquid beat Clutch Gaming in a close five games series to secure their place at Worlds 2019. They advanced to the summer finals where they met the second seeded Cloud9. It was a tightly contested series with Liquid winning the first game of the series, but dropping the next two to Cloud9. Liquid managed to turn the tables and win games 4 and 5 to secure their 4th straight LCS trophy and Doublelift his 7th championship overall. This win made Doublelift the player with the most titles in NA LCS history. At Worlds 2019 Liquid had a lackluster 3-3 performance which led to them once again being eliminated in the group stage.\n\n=== 2020 ===\nWith their premature exit from Worlds, Liquid parted ways with their jungler, Xmithie and signed former Fnatic Jungler, Broxah. Prior to the start of the spring 2020 split, Broxah had visa issues preventing him from joining them for the start of the spring season. Team Liquid performed very poorly, a far cry from their domination of the years prior. Midway through the split, Doublelift was benched in favor of Team Liquid Academy ADC Tactical. According Doublelift, this decision stemmed from his apparent lack of motivation to begin the 2020 spring split. Doublelift publicly apologized to his teammates for his attitude, and promised to work harder to return to the LCS stage. Doublelift returned to the starting lineup the following week, but ultimately Liquid finished the split in 9th place and did not make 2020 Spring Playoffs.\n\nWith a disappointing finish to Spring 2020, Team Liquid traded Doublelift to Team Solo Mid for the 2020 Summer Split.\n\n==Personal Life==\nPeng was born on July 19, 1993, and grew up in [[Mission Viejo]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.ongamers.com/videos/doublelifts-birthday-talks-crazy-c9-match-and-gift/2300-1234/|title=Doublelift's Birthday: Talks Crazy C9 Match and Gifts From Fans|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=July 20, 2015|access-date=2015-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126063500/http://www.ongamers.com/videos/doublelifts-birthday-talks-crazy-c9-match-and-gift/2300-1234/|archive-date=November 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He has a younger and an older brother.
