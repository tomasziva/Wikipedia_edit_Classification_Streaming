[[Steve Burd]] described it as \"branding the shopping experience.\"\n\nThe launch included a redesigned logo, a new slogan \"Ingredients for life\" alongside a four-panel life icon to be used throughout stores and advertising, and a web application called \"FoodFlex\" to improve consumer nutrition. Many locations are being converted to the \"Lifestyle\" format. The new look was designed by Michigan-based PPC Design. In addition to the \"inviting decor with warm ambiance and subdued lighting,\" the move required heavy redesign of store layout, new employee uniforms, sushi and olive bars, and the addition of in-store [[Starbucks]] kiosks (with cupholders on grocery carts). The change also involved differentiating the company from competitors with promotions based on the company's extensive loyalty card database. At the end of 2004, there were 142 \"Lifestyle\" format stores in the United States and Canada, with plans to open or remodel another 300 stores with this type of theme the following year. \"Lifestyle format\" stores have seen significantly higher average weekly sales than their other stores.

[[Steve Burd]] described it as \"branding the shopping experience.\"\n\nThe launch included a redesigned logo, a new slogan \"Ingredients for life\" alongside a four-panel life icon to be used throughout stores and advertising, and a web application called \"FoodFlex\" to improve consumer nutrition. Many locations are being converted to the \"Lifestyle\" format. The new look was designed by Michigan-based PPC Design. In addition to the \"inviting decor with warm ambiance and subdued lighting,\" the move required heavy redesign of store layout, new employee uniforms, sushi and olive bars, and the addition of in-store [[Starbucks]] kiosks (with cupholders on grocery carts). The change also involved differentiating the company from competitors with promotions based on the company's extensive loyalty card database. At the end of 2004, there were 142 \"Lifestyle\" format stores in the United States and Canada, with plans to open or remodel another 300 stores with this type of theme the following year. \"Lifestyle format\" stores have seen significantly higher average weekly sales than their other stores. By the end of 2006, shares were up proving that this rebranding campaign had a major impact on sale figures.\n\n==Slogans==\n* ''Vons is Value'' (mid-to-late 1990s)\n* ''Delivering Our Best'' (late 1990s-2005)\n* ''Ingredients for life'' (2005\u20132015)\n* ''It's Just Better'' (2015\u2013present)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Supermarkets|Companies|Food}}\n* [[Albertsons]] \u2014 ''parent corporation''.\n* [[Pavilions (supermarket)]] \u2014 ''upscale Vons marque''.\n* [[Safeway Inc.]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|vons.com}}\n*[http://mobile.vons.com/ Official Vons mobile app]\n*<!---advert ?---[http://wikimapia.org/#lat=34.8958169&lon=-117.0085667&z=17&l=0&m=b&show=/20017472/VONS-Gorcery-Store-Store-2376&search=vons%20Barstow Wikimapia: Vons location in Barstow, California]--->\n\n{{Albertsons Companies}}\n{{Supermarkets of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Supermarkets of the United States]]\n[[Category:Superstores in the United States]]<!-- DO NOT REMOVE this CATEGORY - VONS is a BIG-BOX STORE -->\n[[Category:Companies based in Fullerton, California]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Los Angeles]]<!--1906-1928-->\n[[Category:American companies established in 1906]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1906]]\n[[Category:1906 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Safeway Inc.]]\n[[Category:Supermarkets based in California]]\n", "name_user": "2600:387:8:9::2f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e1980s\u2013present:They are Kool with the klan!)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vons"}
