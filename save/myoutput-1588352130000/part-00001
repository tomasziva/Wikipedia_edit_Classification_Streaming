An article by the ''Financial Post'', quotes Wilkins saying on a panel discussion during the G7 Women's Forum in Toronto: \"We're doing projects where we actually require that diversity of thought...Whether we're thinking about digitization, whether we're thinking about crypto assets, what the new economy is going to look like. We need that diversity.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/central-bank-no-2-says-more-diversity-at-policy-table-is-key-in-modern-economy|title=Bank of Canada\u2019s Wilkins says more diversity at policy table essential in modern economy {{!}} Financial Post|last=News|last2=Economy|date=2018-05-11|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> She said in the talk that diversity needs to be factored into the consideration of the Bank's framework of the prescience of the issue, with the levels of inequality in society rising, creating greater concern as inequality leads to volatile economic growth, and less trust in institutions.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nWilkins also spoke in regards to inequality at the G7 Symposium on Innovation and Inclusive Growth in Montebello, Quebec in February 2018 , referring to the effect of technological advances on the economy.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/02/crossroads-innovation-inclusive-growth/|title=At the Crossroads: Innovation and Inclusive Growth|website=www.bankofcanada.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> She said in the talk that though technological innovation is key to economic growth, it has also left many behind, and that mainstream macro-economists are factoring how income distribution may affect long-term growth and macro dynamics.<ref name=\":7\" /> Wilkins said at the Symposium that central bankers do not have the mandate or tools to address this disparity by influencing the pace of technological process or income distribution, but that they have to support strong and sustainable growth, and be an advisor to analyze the tradeoffs that come with technological advancement.<ref name=\":7\" /> She suggests focusing on the development of skilled works, and keeping market power in check as two ways to address this issue.<ref name=\":7\" /> On developing skilled workers, she says, this will require reducing barriers to participation in the workforce, such as gender discrimination in the STEM fields.<ref name=\":7\" /> Keeping the market power of the tech industry in check, she says, is also important due to the potential concerns from monopoly power on prices and competition, such as lowering innovation and preventing more-inclusive growth.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn regards to financial technology, Wilkins has written and spoken often about how financial technology, such as [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] and the digitization of the economy, should be considered in regard to the Bank's monetary policy, as technological change has a profound effect on the economy.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewesternstar.com/business/how-the-digitalization-of-the-economy-is-changing-the-bank-of-canada-295480/|title=How the digitalization of the economy is changing the Bank of Canada|last=Wilkins|first=Carolyn A.|date=March 27, 2019|website=The Western Star|access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref> She writes that understanding the relation between technological change and the economy is essential for monetary policy because it \"appears to be changing the relationship between unemployment and inflation.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> In a conference address to the Rotman School of Management in March 2018, Wilkins said of cryptocurrency that she does not regard these products as currency because, \"they do not perform any of the key functions of money.\"<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/03/financial-stability-taking-care-of-unfinished-business/|title=Financial Stability: Taking Care of Unfinished Business|website=www.bankofcanada.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> She said that they are concerning because they could have financial stability implications, relating to investor protection, market integrity and the use of crypto assets for illegal activities.<ref name=\":8\" /> Considering that crypto currencies are unregulated, they present financial risk, and so Wilkins suggested at the conference that international authorities should work together to build a set of policies that govern crypto assets.<ref name=\":8\" /> Outlining these issues she said:<blockquote>My bottom line here is that we need a sharpened focus on consumer and investor protection, and market integrity. These are foundational elements of a sound financial system because they support trust.<ref name=\":8\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Awards ==\nWilkins was a winner of Canada's Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Award by the Women's Executive Network in 2016 and 2018 in the category of Public Sector Leaders.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wxnetwork.com/wxn/top100_2018_awards/|title=WXN Top100 2018 awards (published working copy)|website=PhaseNyne - Canada English|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref><br />\n\n== Personal Life ==\nAs of 2015, \"[she] spends as much time as possible with her partner Victor and her 16-year-old son Samuel.
