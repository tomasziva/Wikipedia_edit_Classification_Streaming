The power law implies that the degree distribution of these networks has no characteristic scale. In contrast, networks with a single well-defined scale are somewhat similar to a lattice in that every node has (roughly) the same degree. Examples of networks with a single scale include the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model|Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) random graph]], [[random regular graphs]], [[regular lattices]], and [[hypercube]]s. Some models of growing networks that produce scale-invariant degree distributions are the [[Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model]] and the [[fitness model (network theory)|fitness model]]. In a network with a scale-free degree distribution, some vertices have a degree that is orders of magnitude larger than the average - these vertices are often called \"hubs\", although this language is misleading as, by definition, there is no inherent threshold above which a node can be viewed as a hub. If there were such a threshold, the network would not be scale-free.\n\nInterest in scale-free networks began in the late 1990s with the reporting of discoveries of power-law degree distributions in real world networks such as the [[World Wide Web]], the network of [[Autonomous system (Internet)|Autonomous systems]] (ASs), some networks of Internet routers, protein interaction networks, email networks, etc.  Most of these reported \"power laws\" fail when challenged with rigorous statistical testing, but the more general idea of heavy-tailed degree distributions -- which many of these networks do genuinely exhibit (before finite-size effects occur) -- are very different from what one would expect if edges existed independently and at random (i.e., if they followed a [[Poisson distribution]]). There are many different ways to build a network with a power-law degree distribution. The [[Yule-Simon distribution|Yule process]] is a canonical generative process for power laws, and has been known since 1925. However, it is known by many other names due to its frequent reinvention, e.g., The Gibrat principle by [[Herbert A. Simon]], the [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]], cumulative advantage and, [[preferential attachment]] by [[Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si|Barab\u00e1si]] and Albert for power-law degree distributions. Recently, [[Hyperbolic Geometric Graph]]s have been suggested as yet another way of constructing scale-free networks.\n\nSome networks with a power-law degree distribution (and specific other types of structure) can be highly resistant to the random deletion of vertices\u2014i.e., the vast majority of vertices remain connected together in a giant component.<ref name=\"CohenErez2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Reuven|last2=Erez|first2=Keren|last3=ben-Avraham|first3=Daniel|last4=Havlin|first4=Shlomo|title=Resilience of the Internet to Random Breakdowns|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|issue=21|year=2000|pages=4626\u20134628|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4626|bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.4626C|pmid=11082612|arxiv=cond-mat/0007048}}</ref> Such networks can also be quite sensitive to targeted attacks aimed at fracturing the network quickly. When the graph is uniformly random except for the degree distribution, these critical vertices are the ones with the highest degree, and have thus been implicated in the spread of disease (natural and artificial) in social and communication networks, and in the spread of fads (both of which are modeled by a [[percolation]] or [[branching process]]). While random graphs (ER) have an average distance of order log N<ref name=\"sec\"/> between nodes, where N is the number of nodes, scale free graph can have a distance of log log N. Such graphs are called ultra small world networks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=R. Cohen|first=S. Havlin|title=Scale-free networks are ultrasmall|journal=Phys. Rev.

The small world hypothesis, which was first described by the Hungarian writer [[Frigyes Karinthy]] in 1929, and tested experimentally by [[Stanley Milgram]] (1967), is the idea that two arbitrary people are connected by only six degrees of separation, i.e. the diameter of the corresponding graph of social connections is not much larger than six. In 1998, [[Duncan J. Watts]] and [[Steven Strogatz]] published the first small-world network model, which through a single parameter smoothly interpolates between a random graph and a lattice.<ref name=\"sec\"/> Their model demonstrated that with the addition of only a small number of long-range links, a regular graph, in which the diameter is proportional to the size of the network, can be transformed into a \"small world\" in which the average number of edges between any two vertices is very small (mathematically, it should grow as the logarithm of the size of the network), while the clustering coefficient stays large. It is known that a wide variety of abstract graphs exhibit the small-world property, e.g., random graphs and scale-free networks. Further, real world networks such as the [[World Wide Web]] and the metabolic network also exhibit this property.\n\nIn the scientific literature on networks, there is some ambiguity associated with the term \"small world\". In addition to referring to the size of the diameter of the network, it can also refer to the co-occurrence of a small diameter and a high [[clustering coefficient]]. The clustering coefficient is a metric that represents the density of triangles in the network. For instance, sparse random graphs have a vanishingly small clustering coefficient while real world networks often have a coefficient significantly larger. Scientists point to this difference as suggesting that edges are correlated in real world networks.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Community structure]]\n* [[Complex adaptive system]]\n* [[Complex systems]]\n* [[Dual-phase evolution]]\n* [[Dynamic network analysis]]\n* [[Interdependent networks]]\n* [[Network theory]]\n* [[Network science]]\n* [[Percolation theory]]\n* [[Random graph]]\n* [[Scale-free networks]]\n* [[Small world networks]]\n* [[Spatial network]]\n* [[Trophic coherence]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Books==\n*B.

The power law implies that the degree distribution of these networks has no characteristic scale. In contrast, networks with a single well-defined scale are somewhat similar to a lattice in that every node has (roughly) the same degree. Examples of networks with a single scale include the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model|Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) random graph]], [[random regular graphs]], [[regular lattices]], and [[hypercube]]s. Some models of growing networks that produce scale-invariant degree distributions are the [[Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model]] and the [[fitness model (network theory)|fitness model]]. In a network with a scale-free degree distribution, some vertices have a degree that is orders of magnitude larger than the average - these vertices are often called \"hubs\", although this language is misleading as, by definition, there is no inherent threshold above which a node can be viewed as a hub. If there were such a threshold, the network would not be scale-free.\n\nInterest in scale-free networks began in the late 1990s with the reporting of discoveries of power-law degree distributions in real world networks such as the [[World Wide Web]], the network of [[Autonomous system (Internet)|Autonomous systems]] (ASs), some networks of Internet routers, protein interaction networks, email networks, etc.  Most of these reported \"power laws\" fail when challenged with rigorous statistical testing, but the more general idea of heavy-tailed degree distributions -- which many of these networks do genuinely exhibit (before finite-size effects occur) -- are very different from what one would expect if edges existed independently and at random (i.e., if they followed a [[Poisson distribution]]). There are many different ways to build a network with a power-law degree distribution. The [[Yule-Simon distribution|Yule process]] is a canonical generative process for power laws, and has been known since 1925. However, it is known by many other names due to its frequent reinvention, e.g., The Gibrat principle by [[Herbert A. Simon]], the [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]], cumulative advantage and, [[preferential attachment]] by [[Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si|Barab\u00e1si]] and Albert for power-law degree distributions. Recently, [[Hyperbolic Geometric Graph]]s have been suggested as yet another way of constructing scale-free networks.\n\nSome networks with a power-law degree distribution (and specific other types of structure) can be highly resistant to the random deletion of vertices\u2014i.e., the vast majority of vertices remain connected together in a giant component.<ref name=\"CohenErez2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Reuven|last2=Erez|first2=Keren|last3=ben-Avraham|first3=Daniel|last4=Havlin|first4=Shlomo|title=Resilience of the Internet to Random Breakdowns|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|issue=21|year=2000|pages=4626\u20134628|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4626|bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.4626C|pmid=11082612|arxiv=cond-mat/0007048}}</ref> Such networks can also be quite sensitive to targeted attacks aimed at fracturing the network quickly. When the graph is uniformly random except for the degree distribution, these critical vertices are the ones with the highest degree, and have thus been implicated in the spread of disease (natural and artificial) in social and communication networks, and in the spread of fads (both of which are modeled by a [[percolation]] or [[branching process]]). While random graphs (ER) have an average distance of order log N<ref name=\"sec\"/> between nodes, where N is the number of nodes, scale free graph can have a distance of log log N. Such graphs are called ultra small world networks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=R. Cohen|first=S. Havlin|title=Scale-free networks are ultrasmall|journal=Phys. Rev.

The small world hypothesis, which was first described by the Hungarian writer [[Frigyes Karinthy]] in 1929, and tested experimentally by [[Stanley Milgram]] (1967), is the idea that two arbitrary people are connected by only six degrees of separation, i.e. the diameter of the corresponding graph of social connections is not much larger than six. In 1998, [[Duncan J. Watts]] and [[Steven Strogatz]] published the first small-world network model, which through a single parameter smoothly interpolates between a random graph and a lattice.<ref name=\"sec\"/> Their model demonstrated that with the addition of only a small number of long-range links, a regular graph, in which the diameter is proportional to the size of the network, can be transformed into a \"small world\" in which the average number of edges between any two vertices is very small (mathematically, it should grow as the logarithm of the size of the network), while the clustering coefficient stays large. It is known that a wide variety of abstract graphs exhibit the small-world property, e.g., random graphs and scale-free networks. Further, real world networks such as the [[World Wide Web]] and the metabolic network also exhibit this property.\n\nIn the scientific literature on networks, there is some ambiguity associated with the term \"small world\". In addition to referring to the size of the diameter of the network, it can also refer to the co-occurrence of a small diameter and a high [[clustering coefficient]]. The clustering coefficient is a metric that represents the density of triangles in the network. For instance, sparse random graphs have a vanishingly small clustering coefficient while real world networks often have a coefficient significantly larger. Scientists point to this difference as suggesting that edges are correlated in real world networks.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Community structure]]\n* [[Complex adaptive system]]\n* [[Complex systems]]\n* [[Dual-phase evolution]]\n* [[Dynamic network analysis]]\n* [[Interdependent networks]]\n* [[Network theory]]\n* [[Network science]]\n* [[Percolation theory]]\n* [[Random graph]]\n* [[Scale-free networks]]\n* [[Small world networks]]\n* [[Spatial network]]\n* [[Trophic coherence]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Books==\n*B.
