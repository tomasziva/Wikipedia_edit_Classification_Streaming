She has worked with anthropologist Louise Hamby throughout the years and many of her works have been spotlighted at different art festivals, collections, galleries, and museums. \n\n== Biography ==\nLucy Malirrimurruwuy Wanapuyngu was born in 1955 at the Mainoru cattle station in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia. After living in Mainoru for four years, she moved to the [[Roper River]] area. She lived in Roper River for eight years before moving to Sydney. During this time of her life, she had an incident in the ceremony ground and was not able to walk. Community elders adopted her and looked after her while she spent a majority of her time sheltered inside. She reports that ''balanda'', white people, came from Sydney to look after her<ref name=\":0\" />. Someone by the name of Nancy was taking care of her until a doctor from Adelaide visited Roper River and addressed her medical needs. Her family then moved to join her in Roper River: Djardi, Florence Bertie, Vera and Sam Ashley. After some time, the moved to [[Elcho Island|Galiwin'ku]] and this is where Lucy met her husband, Ian Wurruwul. After marrying Wurruwul, the couple had five children before moving to [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], also known as Lake Evella.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since then, they have had five grandchildren and Lucy has been able to travel the world and lead workshops teaching outsiders the cultural significance weaving has to her community.\n\n== Career ==\n \nSince childhood, Lucy has been exposed to fiber works. Many of the traditions involved in fiber works and weaving symbolize the sanctatity of motherhood in [[Yolngu]] culture. Basket making and other forms of weaving have also been important to the women of Yolngu culture. The older women of the community pass down the knowledge on to the younger generation. Through frequent family gatherings, knowledge about harvesting, preparation of specific plant materials, and craft skills continue to be passed on and adapted from one generation to the next.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lucy was responsible for teaching many family members, including her sisters and children how to make specific dyes along with complex weaving techniques.<ref>''Education Kit: Menagerie.''

Jewelry such as necklaces are a a crucial component to Aboriginal culture. Traditionally, it was customary for necklaces to be worn by both men and women during ceremonies relating to sexuality and fecundity.

This workshop brought together educators conservators about the process of harvesting, preparing and conserving barks and pandanus, dyes, ochres and other natural materials. Lucy, along with other senior weavers such as Ruth Nalmakarra from Milingimbi, and Lorrie Murburrk from Maningrida worked together to educate scholars on pandanus weaving and bush string making.    \n\n    \n\nFrom July 2019 to April 2020, the exhibtion \"With Her Hands: Women\u2019s Fiber Art from Gapuwiyak: The Louise Hamby Gift\" has been on display at the [[Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection]]. Lucy met Hamby during Hamby's 1995 - 2001 research in the Arnhem Land region of Northern Australia.

During creation of the Hamby Collection, Lucy and her daughter, Anna, were consulted by Louise Hamby. In July of 2019, Lucy along with her daughter, Anna, and grandson, Ryan, were able to visit the Kluge-Ruhe in Charlottesville for three weeks. During this trip, Lucy and Anna helped the curation team at the Kluge-Ruhe and led workshops for visitors of the exhibition.                \n\n\nLucy has also been a participant and held workshops at the Selling Yarns Conferences.<ref name=\":1\" /> The first conference was held in 2006, the second in 2009, and the third in 2013.
