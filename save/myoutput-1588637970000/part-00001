Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxi's have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and premium grade petrol IR8,000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The nation's abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].<ref name='Iran'/> Some 1.8 billion liters of oil products worth 10 trillion rials ($1 billion) are smuggled out of [[Iran]] per annum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2597/pdf/i3.pdf |accessdate=August 2, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nGiven Iran's limited refining capacity, there has been a shortfall in petroleum products in recent years, requiring Iran to import an estimated {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2006/07. As a result, there is a recognition among many policymakers of the need to raise prices, and gradual increases have been implemented. However, these have tended to lag the prevailing rate of inflation, and given that raising petrol prices is politically difficult the provision of cheap fuel is likely to persist in the medium term, encouraging the purchase of vehicles. The government was nevertheless forced to take action in June 2007 when it announced both a petrol increase to 12 cents/litre and [[2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran|the imposition of fuel rationing]], much to the chagrin of vehicle owners. The policy, which allocates 120 litres maximum per month (following revisions in December) to private car owners, will run until end-2008/09.<ref name='Iran'/>\n\n===CNG===\n{{See also|Energy in Iran}}\nIn 2008 and 2009, Iranian government spent over 3 billion dollars on CNG infrastructure as part of its plan to convert its fuel policy from gasoline to [[CNG]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Radcom |url=http://www.ecasb.com/newsdetail-2385-en.html |title=IRAN NGV 2010 |publisher=Ecasb.com |accessdate=2010-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121205749/http://ecasb.com/newsdetail-2385-en.html |archivedate=21 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Iran, with the world\u2019s second-largest natural gas reserves after Russia, in 2011 became the world leader in natural gas vehicles with some 2.9 million on the road, narrowly edging Pakistan, which is trailed by Argentina, Brazil and India, respectively.
