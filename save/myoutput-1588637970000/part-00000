Over the past two decades, Gander has established an international reputation through a vast and pluralistic body of artworks that materialise in many different forms, ranging from sculpture, apparel and writing to architecture, painting, typefaces, publications and performance. As well as curating exhibitions, he is a committed educator, having taught at international art institutions and universities, and has written and presented television programmes on and about contemporary art and culture for the [[BBC]].  \n\nGander is typically described as a [[conceptual artist]], but this is a term he has refuted, referring instead to himself as \u2018a sort of neo-conceptualist, Proper-\u201cGander\u201d-ist, amateur philosopher\u2019.<ref>Ryan Gander interviewed by Simon Turnbull, ''L&N Magazine'', 'Community Issue', Issue 04: https://www.dropbox.com/s/t7uyu8xryggh8u5/L%26N_TabloidLN04_AW_11.pdf?dl=0</ref> Through creative and associative thought processes that connect everyday life and the esoteric, the overlooked and the commonplace, Gander\u2019s work involves a questioning of language and knowledge, a reinvention of the modes of appearance and creation of an artwork.<ref>Ryan Gander, 2019-20 Hodder Fellow, Lewis Center, Princeton University, https://arts.princeton.edu/people/profiles/rgander/.

Dial up stuff, which was quite laborious, and I would have a yearly trip to London to go to the [[Tate]]\u2019. \u2018I didn\u2019t know where else to go,\u2019 he continued, \u2018so I always saw art as an image, a caption, a text about it, a title, a view.\u2019<ref>''Art of Conversation'', 'Ryan Gander & Cory Arcangel Discuss Context and Intention at Lisson Gallery', 14 October 2018: http://aofc.co</ref> \n\nAfter graduating from art school he went to work in a carpet shop in Chester before attempting to train as a journalist at North Wales Newspapers. Although employed briefly as a photographer, he was rejected as a journalist because his writing \u2018was too bad\u2019. Asked when he knew he wanted to be an artist, Gander replied: \u2018I didn't think I\u2019d be an artist. It sounds horrible and crass, but to be totally honest I thought I\u2019d be a TV presenter\u2019.<ref>''Art of Conversation'', 'Ryan Gander & Cory Arcangel Discuss Context and Intention at Lisson Gallery', 14 October 2018: http://aofc.co</ref>\n\nBetween 1999 to 2000 he was an artist-in-residence at the [[Jan_van_Eyck_Academie|Jan van Eyck Akademie]] in Maastricht, Netherlands, as a Fine Art Research Participant. In 2001 he participated in the artist residency programme of the [[Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten]] in Amsterdam, also in the Netherlands, finishing in 2002. In 2004, he was made Cocheme Fellow at [[Byam Shaw School of Art]], London. \n\nIt was winning the 2005 [[Baloise Art Prize]] at [[Art Basel]] for the presentation of his video work ''[https://artprize.baloise.com/en/home/awarded-artists/Ryan-Gander.html Is this Guilt in You Too (The Study of a Car in a Field)]'' that launched Gander\u2019s career as an artist.

Retrieved 25 February 2020.</ref>\n\n==Work==\nRyan Gander\u2019s body of work is vast and pluralistic. As the critic Philipp Hindahl wrote in ''[http://moussemagazine.it Mousse Magazine]'': \u2018Gander creates output so diverse that it sometimes is impossible to tell if you are seeing a show by the British artist or a well-curated group show.\u2019<ref>Philipp Hindahl, 'Of Mice and Mortality: Ryan Gander', ''Mousse Magazine'', June 2019: http://moussemagazine.it/mice-mortality-ryan-gander. Retrieved 25/02/20.</ref> His work can be reminiscent of a puzzle, a network with multiple connections, the fragments of an embedded story, a huge set of hidden clues to be deciphered, encouraging viewers to make their own connections and invent their own narrative in order to solve the charade with its many solutions, staged by the artist.<ref>'Film Screening: Me, My Selfie and I', 6 Dec 2019: https://humanities.princeton.edu/event/screening-me-my-selfie-and-i/</ref> This approach is exemplified in his major commission with [[Artangel]] titled ''[https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/locked-room-scenario/ Locked Room Scenario]'' (2011), in which the visitor enters a totally designed office space in a former trading depot where they are invited to solve the mystery of a group show of fictionalised artists, including their work, to which they are denied access.<ref>'Ryan Gander: Locked Room Scenario', Artangel: https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/locked-room-scenario. Retrieved 25 Feb 2020. </ref>\n\n===No style style===\nGander\u2019s work is not invested in any medium or style as such. Suspicious of the positive link between artistic style, medium and work, Gander has cultivated a \u2018non-style\u2019 that enables him to pursue ideas across many traditionally understood artistic media. \u2018Brilliant practitioners,\u2019 Gander believes: \n\n{{quote|are those who know how to move around language. If you move around language you have to move around devices and materials... When I\u2019m making work one of the choices I make during a million other choices is what is it going to be?

His series of works titled ''Device #5'' (2005) might be functional devices but actually are not. His installation at [[Documenta|dOCUMENTA]] (13) titled ''[https://www.documenta.de/en/retrospective/documenta_13 I need some meaning I can memorise (The Invisible Pull)]'' (2012) presented an empty room with a light breeze circulating. In 2015, Gander erected ''[https://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/ryan-gander The artist\u2019s second phone]'', a giant billboard installed outside Lisson Gallery, London, which borrows the aesthetic of vacant Mexican billboards to announce his phone number to all passing. The series of works '[https://www.contemporaryartgallery.ca/exhibitions/window-spaces-ryan-gander-a-lamp-made-by-the-artist-for-his-wife/ A lamp made by the artist for his wife]' (2013) are ad hoc combinations of products available from most hardware stores to produce a functioning item of furniture. Recently, Gander has increasingly used vending machines to distribute works. At frieze art fair 2019 ''Time Well Spent'' (2019) dispensed pebbles for \u00a3500 a piece.<ref>'British artist Ryan Gander's vending machine sells art for $600 a pop', CNN Online, 4 Oct 2019: https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ryan-gander-art-vending-machine/index.html. Retrieved 25 Feb 2020.</ref>\n\n===Collision and association===\nGander\u2019s fascination with techniques of creative and associative collisions is evident in his earliest \u2018Loose Association\u2019 public lecturers, begun in 2002, and published together in 2007 as the book ''[http://onestarpress.com/book/ryan-gander-loose-associations-and-other-lectures Loose Associations and Other Lectures]''. These lectures range across material, from meditations on the film ''[[Back to the Future]]'' to the writing of [[Italo Calvino]], modernism to children\u2019s books. Motifs of association and collision are evident across his works and he has explored techniques of association used by earlier modernist artists and architects, notably [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]] and [[Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger]]. With the sculptural series ''[https://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/ryan-gander-the-fallout-of-living The Way Things Collide]'' (2012 - ongoing) Gander collides two elements that are hardest to be associated logically with the human mind. Each is a game, a challenge, with narrative consequences. A knotted condom is left on a USM cabinet; a skate wing rests on a suitcase; a macaroon balances on a stool. These are experiments in minimum constituents of narrative.\n\n===Creativity===\nGander believes that everyone makes creative decisions in their daily life and can be a creative artist.<ref>'Ryan Gander: How To Live The Creative Life', BBC, last broadcast on BBC World News, 29 Dec 2016: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3ct1929.</ref> These everyday acts of creativity, he argues, are often more exciting than the creative artworks of celebrated contemporary artists, whose repetition of a successful formula is contrary to creativity. Art for Gander is about \u2018trying to make some original contribution to human history and knowledge, like an explorer\u2019.<ref>Ryan Gander and Tony Chambers: How we redesigned the Kitchen Sink', Richard Benson, The Guardian, 29 Sept 2019: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/29/otomoto-collaboration-to-make-ordinary-things-pleasurable. Retrieved 25 Feb 2020.</ref>\n\nTo avoid habitualised ways of working, Gander has looked to children\u2019s creativity, frequently collaborating with his daughters to realise artworks. Likewise, since the early 2000s he has used an array of pseudonyms to produce work outside of his typical concerns. These fictional characters spread across an increasingly growing web of citation and cross-reference, self-corroborating and self-sustaining fictional and possible historical events. In 2014, Gander told an interviewer that: \u2018I hope my work is [\u2026] expansive or \u201cmultiplicit\u201d (that is not a word but it should be). An objective is that the work has more end points than starting points \u2013 like a 1970s children\u2019s \u2018Choose your own adventure story\u2019\u2019.<ref>'Interview with Ryan Gander', Timoth\u00e9e Chaillou, ''The White Review'', Jan 2012:  http://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-ryan-gander.

Despite various interviews and works made in which Gander explicitly states he does not understand himself to be disabled or differently abled to anyone else, his work is interpreted, often by able-bodied commentators, as that of a disabled artist. The curator [[Matthew_Higgs|Matthew Higgs]], for example, has argued that his disability contributes to his unique way of seeing: \u2018The first thing I ever noticed about Ryan was that he uses a wheelchair. I mention this not in passing, nor as a gratuitous aside. Whilst I accept that some people might argue that this information is irrelevant, I would like to think that the fact that Ryan uses a wheelchair does \u2013 at least \u2013 have some bearing on my subsequent understanding of his work.\u2019<ref>'Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam - The Death of Abbe Farria - Ryan Gander'. www.smba.nl. Retrieved 21 Nov 2018.</ref> \n\nPreviously, Gander has not addressed the appearance of his wheelchair in works, however in recent years he has felt compelled to in order to correct other people's perception of his exceptionalism as a wheelchair user. In the [[BBC]] television programme '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0003g0r Me, My Selfie and I with Ryan Gander]', broadcast in 2019, Gander meets a transhumanist with a chip imbedded in his palm to open doors who tells him he might be \u2018improved\u2019 too with bionic limbs modelled on cheetah legs to replace his. Bemused, Gander replies: \u2018Being in a wheelchair doesn\u2019t affect my view on the world. In an age where everyone identifies with being different, I am someone who actually can\u2019t walk and don\u2019t associate with being disabled. I don\u2019t tick the [[Arts Council]] funding box that says \u201cdisabled\u201d because I don\u2019t identify.\u2019 He continues, \u2018I don\u2019t want cheetah legs.

I happen to have been born with a great difference to most, and one that is visually recognisable at that. A curse to some, but a blessing to others. To me, it is neither. I am not sure how or when, but at some point, I just chose not identify with my difference. I chose to ignore it, not in the hope that it would go away, but in the hope that being different would not consume my time and energy that could be better spent doing all the good stuff in the world.<ref>SOLID HOUSE Press release, Transcript: ''THE END'', 2020 </ref>}}\n\n===Public sculpture===\nRyan Gander has been commissioned to produce public art works for a range of sites, including [[Central Park]], USA, Karlsaue Park, Kassel, Germany, Mexico City Zoo, [[Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral|The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King]], Liverpool, and [https://cambridge-biomedical.com Cambridge Biomedical Campus].  \n\nIn 2010, Gander\u2019s sculpture ''[https://www.publicartfund.org/exhibitions/view/the-happy-prince/ The Happy Prince]'' was commissioned by the [[Public Art Fund]] for Central Park, New York City. This concrete resin sculpture presented the ruin of the fictional statue from the final chapter in [[Oscar Wilde]]\u2019s children\u2019s book ''[[The_Happy_Prince_and_Other_Tales|The Happy Prince]]'' (1888). The first of an ongoing number of public sculptures, Gander noted in an interview with ''[[The White Review]]'' magazine that he\u2019d become disillusioned with contemporary art\u2019s institutions and felt public art was a new challenge: \n\n{{quote|I am embarking on a series of challenges I have set for myself and public art was the first.

Off the park\u2019s designated paths, a trapdoor fabricated from iron and concrete appeared to lead to an underground series of tunnels of some kind. The hatch, visibly partially open so that the spectator might partially peer inside, showed ladder rungs leading down. The same year, Gander\u2019s work ''[http://www.g39.org/cgi-bin/website.cgi?place=artists&id=2568&image=6 It\u2019s got such good heart in it]'' was commissioned by Mexico City Zoo and located in the \u2018activity centre\u2019 for lions. Based on [[Sol LeWitt]]'s open cube structure \u2013 and the story that LeWitt allowed his cats to use his redundant sculpture \u2013 upscaled and added to, it was offered as a climbing frame and scratching post for lions. \n\nIn 2018, Gander produced two public artworks, the first sited outside [[BALTIC]] gallery, Newcastle and the second outside [[Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral|The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King]], Liverpool as part of the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. In the former, titled ''[http://balticplus.uk/ryan-gander-to-give-light-northern-aspirational-charms-e759/ To Give Light (Northern Aspirational Charms)]'', ten minimal, simplified forms based on ten objects originally designed to emit or shine light were cast in black concrete and arranged chronologically in a circular configuration. Each element featured three links of mooring chain attached, implying a nautical functionality as well as alluding to trinkets on an oversized charm bracelet. The latter, titled ''[https://www.biennial.com/2018/exhibition/liverpool-metropolitan-cathedral From five minds of great vision (The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King disassembled and reassembled to conjure resting places in the public realm)]'', consisted of five public artworks, functional as benches, placed in a circle in the public square outside the cathedral. Each artwork was enlarged and reproduced from a maquette made by a child from Knotty Ash Primary using building blocks that, when rearranged, made a model of the Cathedral. \n\nIn 2019, Gander was commissioned to produce a public sculpture by [[Cambridge Biomedical Campus]]. Titled ''[https://cambridge-biomedical.com/public-art-cambridge/commission/the-green-and-the-gardens/ The Green & The Gardens]'', Gander led a concept that transformed the space into a green heart of the campus, a shared place for everyone. In collaboration with Gillespies, landscape architects, they developed the design, selected the planting, furniture and lighting. Gander integrated sculptural elements: coloured tents that glow at night, an open gateway, a stile, and a community noticeboard. \n\nOther public artworks include: ''[https://www.thecontemporaryaustin.org/exhibitions/ryan-gander/ The day to day accumulation of hope, failure and ecstasy - The zenith of your career (The Last Degas)]'' (2017), exhibited in the gardens of The Contemporary Austin Commission (USA), in late Autumn, 2018; ''[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/10/18/arts/sci-fi-fact-okayama-art-summit/ Because editorial is costly]'' (2016), a giant, swollen, mirror-finish stainless steel version of 'Rapport de volumes' (1919) by [[Georges Vantongerloo]] in a crater as if crash landed exhibited during the [https://www.okayamaartsummit.jp/2019/en/about/ Okayama Art Summit] (JP); ''[https://aboutmanchester.co.uk/dads-halo-effect-a-new-major-public-artwork-by-ryan-gander-is-revealed-in-beswick/ Dad\u2019s Halo Effect]'' (2014), three polished stainless steel sculptures initially conceived by the artist's father when he worked at General Motors in the 1980s, and based on parts of the steering mechanism of a commercial [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] truck, re-imagined by the artist from his father\u2019s verbal description; ''No political motivation'' (2012), a faithful reproduction of the revolving New Scotland Yard sign constructed to display the words \u2018THE WORLD S FAIR\u2019, incorrectly typeset with a half space between the characters \u2018D\u2019 and \u2019S\u2019 \u2013 meaning the sign could be interpreted in one of two differing ways, as an advertisement for an event or as a political slogan.

Gander was Professor of Visual Art at the [[University of Huddersfield]]. In 2004, he was awarded the Cocheme Fellowship at [[Byam Shaw School of Art]], London. \n\nSubsequently, alongside his artistic practice, Gander has continued to be a visiting lecturer in a range of leading international institutions, including the [[AA School of Architecture]], London, UK; the [[Royal College of Art]], London, UK; [[\u00c9cole nationale des beaux-arts]], Lyon, FR; [[The New School]], New York, US; [[University of Southern California]], US; [[Fudan University]], Shanghai, CN; and [[The Royal Danish Academy of Art]], School of Architecture, Copenhagen, DK.

Gander is currently a patron of [[Castlefield Gallery]], Manchester and part of the [[Arts Council]] England Collection Acquisition Committee. \n\n===Fairfield International and residency programme=== \nIn 2013, Gander and creative consultant Simon Turnbull proposed plans to open [http://fairfieldinternational.co.uk Fairfield International], a residential art school in a former primary school in [[Saxmundham]], Suffolk. Modelled on a hybrid of the Dutch academy and artist residency, Fairfield International would provide six residencies a year to hard-up artists in need of a retreat. \n\nWith no fees, students would receive a living stipend to participate in a non-instrumentalised, non-qualification approach to art education, foregrounding the work itself, minimising competitiveness of the British, particularly London-based, art school system. \u2018I think there are artists who come from situations that hold no other prerogative than to practice art. That sort of freedom is rare,\u2019 Gander told ''[[Artforum]]'' in 2013.

Over the past two decades, Gander has established an international reputation through a vast and pluralistic body of artworks that materialise in many different forms, ranging from sculpture, apparel and writing to architecture, painting, typefaces, publications and performance. As well as curating exhibitions, he is a committed educator, having taught at international art institutions and universities, and has written and presented television programmes on and about contemporary art and culture for the [[BBC]].  \n\nGander is typically described as a [[conceptual artist]], but this is a term he has refuted, referring instead to himself as \u2018a sort of neo-conceptualist, Proper-\u201cGander\u201d-ist, amateur philosopher\u2019.<ref>Ryan Gander interviewed by Simon Turnbull, ''L&N Magazine'', 'Community Issue', Issue 04: https://www.dropbox.com/s/t7uyu8xryggh8u5/L%26N_TabloidLN04_AW_11.pdf?dl=0</ref> Through creative and associative thought processes that connect everyday life and the esoteric, the overlooked and the commonplace, Gander\u2019s work involves a questioning of language and knowledge, a reinvention of the modes of appearance and creation of an artwork.<ref>Ryan Gander, 2019-20 Hodder Fellow, Lewis Center, Princeton University, https://arts.princeton.edu/people/profiles/rgander/.

Although employed briefly as a photographer, he was rejected as a journalist because his writing \u2018was too bad\u2019. Asked when he knew he wanted to be an artist, Gander replied: \u2018I didn't think I\u2019d be an artist.

In 2001 he participated in the artist residency programme of the [[Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten]] in Amsterdam, also in the Netherlands, finishing in 2002.

Retrieved 25 February 2020.</ref>\n\n==Work==\nRyan Gander\u2019s body of work is vast and pluralistic. As the critic Philipp Hindahl wrote in ''[http://moussemagazine.it Mousse Magazine]'': \u2018Gander creates output so diverse that it sometimes is impossible to tell if you are seeing a show by the British artist or a well-curated group show.\u2019<ref>Philipp Hindahl, 'Of Mice and Mortality: Ryan Gander', ''Mousse Magazine'', June 2019: http://moussemagazine.it/mice-mortality-ryan-gander. Retrieved 25/02/20.</ref> His work can be reminiscent of a puzzle, a network with multiple connections, the fragments of an embedded story, a huge set of hidden clues to be deciphered, encouraging viewers to make their own connections and invent their own narrative in order to solve the charade with its many solutions, staged by the artist.<ref>'Film Screening: Me, My Selfie and I', 6 Dec 2019: https://humanities.princeton.edu/event/screening-me-my-selfie-and-i/</ref> This approach is exemplified in his major commission with [[Artangel]] titled ''[https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/locked-room-scenario/ Locked Room Scenario]'' (2011), in which the visitor enters a totally designed office space in an former trading depot where they are invited to solve the mystery of a group show of fictionalised artists, including their work, to which they are denied access.<ref>'Ryan Gander: Locked Room Scenario', Artangel: https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/locked-room-scenario. Retrieved 25 Feb 2020. </ref>\n\n===No style style===\nGander\u2019s work is not invested in any medium or style as such. Suspicious of the positive link between artistic style, medium and work, Gander has cultivated a \u2018non-style\u2019 that enables him to pursue ideas across many traditionally understood artistic media. \u2018Brilliant practitioners,\u2019 Gander believes: \n\n{{quote|are those who know how to move around language. If you move around language you have to move around devices and materials... When I\u2019m making work one of the choices I make during a million other choices is what is it going to be?

His series of works titled ''Device #5'' (2005) might be functional devices but actually are not. His installation at [[Documenta|dOCUMENTA]] (13) titled ''[https://www.documenta.de/en/retrospective/documenta_13 I need some meaning I can memorise (The Invisible Pull)]'' (2012) presented an empty room with a light breeze circulating. In 2015, Gander erected ''[https://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/ryan-gander The artist\u2019s second phone]'', a giant billboard installed outside Lisson Gallery, London, which borrows the aesthetic of vacant Mexican billboards to announce his phone number to all passing. The series of works '[https://www.contemporaryartgallery.ca/exhibitions/window-spaces-ryan-gander-a-lamp-made-by-the-artist-for-his-wife/ A lamp made by the artist for his wife]' (2013) are ad hoc combinations of products available from most hardware stores to produce a functioning item of furniture. Recently, Gander has increasingly used vending machines to distribute works. At frieze art fair 2019 ''Time Well Spent'' (2019) dispensed pebbles for \u00a3500 a piece.<ref>'British artist Ryan Gander's vending machine sells art for $600 a pop', CNN Online, 4 Oct 2019: https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ryan-gander-art-vending-machine/index.html. Retrieved 25 Feb 2020.</ref>\n\n===Collision and association===\nGander\u2019s fascination with techniques of creative and associative collisions is evident in his earliest \u2018Loose Association\u2019 public lecturers, begun in 2002, and published together in 2007 as the book ''[http://onestarpress.com/book/ryan-gander-loose-associations-and-other-lectures Loose Associations and Other Lectures]''. These lectures range across material, from meditations on the film ''[[Back to the Future]]'' to the writing of [[Italo Calvino]], modernism to children\u2019s books. Motifs of association and collision are evident across his works and he has explored techniques of association used by earlier modernist artists and architects, notably [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]] and [[Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger]]. With the sculptural series ''[https://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/ryan-gander-the-fallout-of-living The Way Things Collide]'' (2012 - ongoing) Gander collides two elements that are hardest to be associated logically with the human mind. Each is a game, a challenge, with narrative consequences. A knotted condom is left on a USM cabinet; a skate wing rests on a suitcase; a macaroon balances on a stool. These are experiments in minimum constituents of narrative.\n\n===Creativity===\nGander believes that everyone makes creative decisions in their daily life and can be a creative artist.<ref>'Ryan Gander: How To Live The Creative Life', BBC, last broadcast on BBC World News, 29 Dec 2016: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3ct1929.</ref> These everyday acts of creativity, he argues, are often more exciting than the creative artworks of celebrated contemporary artists, whose repetition of a successful formula is contrary to creativity. Art for Gander is about \u2018trying to make some original contribution to human history and knowledge, like an explorer\u2019.<ref>Ryan Gander and Tony Chambers: How we redesigned the Kitchen Sink', Richard Benson, The Guardian, 29 Sept 2019: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/29/otomoto-collaboration-to-make-ordinary-things-pleasurable. Retrieved 25 Feb 2020.</ref>\n\nTo avoid habitualised ways of working, Gander has looked to children\u2019s creativity, frequently collaborating with his daughters to realise artworks. Likewise, since the early 2000s he has used an array of pseudonyms to produce work outside of his typical concerns. These fictional characters spread across an increasingly growing web of citation and cross-reference, self-corroborating and self-sustaining fictional and possible historical events. In 2014, Gander told an interviewer that: \u2018I hope my work is [\u2026] expansive or \u201cmultiplicit\u201d (that is not a word but it should be). An objective is that the work has more end points than starting points \u2013 like a 1970s children\u2019s \u2018Choose your own adventure story\u2019\u2019.<ref>'Interview with Ryan Gander', Timoth\u00e9e Chaillou, ''The White Review'', Jan 2012:  http://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-ryan-gander.

Despite various interviews and works made in which Gander explicitly states he does not understand himself to be disabled or differently abled to anyone else, his work is interpreted, often by able-bodied commentators, as that of a disabled artist. The curator [[Matthew_Higgs|Matthew Higgs]], for example, has argued that his disability contributes to his unique way of seeing: \u2018The first thing I ever noticed about Ryan was that he uses a wheelchair. I mention this not in passing, nor as a gratuitous aside. Whilst I accept that some people might argue that this information is irrelevant, I would like to think that the fact that Ryan uses a wheelchair does \u2013 at least \u2013 have some bearing on my subsequent understanding of his work.\u2019<ref>'Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam - The Death of Abbe Farria - Ryan Gander'. www.smba.nl. Retrieved 21 Nov 2018.</ref> \n\nPreviously, Gander has not addressed the appearance of his wheelchair in works, however in recent years he has felt compelled to in order to correct other people's perception of his exceptionalism as a wheelchair user. In the [[BBC]] television programme '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0003g0r Me, My Selfie and I with Ryan Gander]', broadcast in 2019, Gander meets a transhumanist with a chip imbedded in his palm to open doors who tells him he might be \u2018improved\u2019 too with bionic limbs modelled on cheetah legs to replace his. Bemused, Gander replies: \u2018Being in a wheelchair doesn\u2019t affect my view on the world. In an age where everyone identifies with being different, I am someone who actually can\u2019t walk and don\u2019t associate with being disabled. I don\u2019t tick the [[Arts Council]] funding box that says \u201cdisabled\u201d because I don\u2019t identify.\u2019 He continues, \u2018I don\u2019t want cheetah legs.

I happen to have been born with a great difference to most, and one that is visually recognisable at that. A curse to some, but a blessing to others. To me, it is neither. I am not sure how or when, but at some point, I just chose not identify with my difference. I chose to ignore it, not in the hope that it would go away, but in the hope that being different would not consume my time and energy that could be better spent doing all the good stuff in the world.<ref>SOLID HOUSE Press release, Transcript: ''THE END'', 2020 </ref>}}\n\n===Public sculpture===\nRyan Gander has been commissioned to produce public art works for a range of sites, including [[Central Park]], USA, Karlsaue Park, Kassel, Germany, Mexico City Zoo, [[Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral|The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King]], Liverpool, and [https://cambridge-biomedical.com Cambridge Biomedical Campus].  \n\nIn 2010, Gander\u2019s sculpture ''[https://www.publicartfund.org/exhibitions/view/the-happy-prince/ The Happy Prince]'' was commissioned by the [[Public Art Fund]] for Central Park, New York City. This concrete resin sculpture presented the ruin of the fictional statue from the final chapter in [[Oscar Wilde]]\u2019s children\u2019s book ''[[The_Happy_Prince_and_Other_Tales|The Happy Prince]]'' (1888). The first of an ongoing number of public sculptures, Gander noted in an interview with ''[[The White Review]]'' magazine that he\u2019d become disillusioned with contemporary art\u2019s institutions and felt public art was a new challenge: \n\n{{quote|I am embarking on a series of challenges I have set for myself and public art was the first.

Off the park\u2019s designated paths, a trapdoor fabricated from iron and concrete appeared to lead to an underground series of tunnels of some kind. The hatch, visibly partially open so that the spectator might partially peer inside, showed ladder rungs leading down. The same year, Gander\u2019s work ''[http://www.g39.org/cgi-bin/website.cgi?place=artists&id=2568&image=6 It\u2019s got such good heart in it]'' was commissioned by Mexico City Zoo and located in the \u2018activity centre\u2019 for lions. Based on [[Sol LeWitt]]'s open cube structure \u2013 and the story that LeWitt allowed his cats to use his redundant sculpture \u2013 upscaled and added to, it was offered as a climbing frame and scratching post for lions. \n\nIn 2018, Gander produced two public artworks, the first sited outside [[BALTIC]] gallery, Newcastle and the second outside [[Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral|The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King]], Liverpool as part of the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. In the former, titled ''[http://balticplus.uk/ryan-gander-to-give-light-northern-aspirational-charms-e759/ To Give Light (Northern Aspirational Charms)]'', ten minimal, simplified forms based on ten objects originally designed to emit or shine light were cast in black concrete and arranged chronologically in a circular configuration. Each element featured three links of mooring chain attached, implying a nautical functionality as well as alluding to trinkets on an oversized charm bracelet. The latter, titled ''[https://www.biennial.com/2018/exhibition/liverpool-metropolitan-cathedral From five minds of great vision (The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King disassembled and reassembled to conjure resting places in the public realm)]'', consisted of five public artworks, functional as benches, placed in a circle in the public square outside the cathedral. Each artwork was enlarged and reproduced from a maquette made by a child from Knotty Ash Primary using building blocks that, when rearranged, made a model of the Cathedral. \n\nIn 2019, Gander was commissioned to produce a public sculpture by [[Cambridge Biomedical Campus]]. Titled ''[https://cambridge-biomedical.com/public-art-cambridge/commission/the-green-and-the-gardens/ The Green & The Gardens]'', Gander led a concept that transformed the space into a green heart of the campus, a shared place for everyone. In collaboration with Gillespies, landscape architects, they developed the design, selected the planting, furniture and lighting. Gander integrated sculptural elements: coloured tents that glow at night, an open gateway, a stile, and a community noticeboard. \n\nOther public artworks include: ''[https://www.thecontemporaryaustin.org/exhibitions/ryan-gander/ The day to day accumulation of hope, failure and ecstasy - The zenith of your career (The Last Degas)]'' (2017), exhibited in the gardens of The Contemporary Austin Commission (USA), in late Autumn, 2018; ''[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/10/18/arts/sci-fi-fact-okayama-art-summit/ Because editorial is costly]'' (2016), a giant, swollen, mirror-finish stainless steel version of 'Rapport de volumes' (1919) by [[Georges Vantongerloo]] in a crater as if crash landed exhibited during the [https://www.okayamaartsummit.jp/2019/en/about/ Okayama Art Summit] (JP); ''[https://aboutmanchester.co.uk/dads-halo-effect-a-new-major-public-artwork-by-ryan-gander-is-revealed-in-beswick/ Dad\u2019s Halo Effect]'' (2014), three polished stainless steel sculptures initially conceived by the artist's father when he worked at General Motors in the 1980s, and based on parts of the steering mechanism of a commercial [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] truck, re-imagined by the artist from his father\u2019s verbal description; ''No political motivation'' (2012), a faithful reproduction of the revolving New Scotland Yard sign constructed to display the words \u2018THE WORLD S FAIR\u2019, incorrectly typeset with a half space between the characters \u2018D\u2019 and \u2019S\u2019 \u2013 meaning the sign could be interpreted in one of two differing ways, as an advertisement for an event or as a political slogan.

Retrieved. 25 Feb 2020.</ref>\n\n==Teaching==\nBetween 2003 and 2004, Gander taught Fine Art part-time at [[Sheffield_Hallam_University|Sheffield Institute of Arts]], [[Leeds College of Art]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]. Gander was Professor of Visual Art at the [[University of Huddersfield]]. In 2004, he was awarded the Cocheme Fellowship at [[Byam Shaw School of Art]], London. \n\nSubsequently, alongside his artistic practice, Gander has continued to be a visiting lecturer in a range of leading international institutions, including the [[AA School of Architecture]], London, UK; the [[Royal College of Art]], London, UK; [[\u00c9cole nationale des beaux-arts]], Lyon, FR; [[The New School]], New York, US; [[University of Southern California]], US; [[Fudan University]], Shanghai, CN; and [[The Royal Danish Academy of Art]], School of Architecture, Copenhagen, DK. In 2019, he began a Hodder Fellowship at the Lewis Center for the Arts at [[Princeton University]], an award given to artists and writers of exceptional promise to pursue independent projects at Princeton University during the academic year.\n\nGander has previously served as a trustee of [[South London Gallery]], London, [[Grizedale Arts|Grizdale Arts]], [[Liverpool Biennial]], Open School East, as well as sitting on [[Tate Modern]] Council and Tate Members Council. Gander is currently a patron of [[Castlefield Gallery]], Manchester and part of the [[Arts Council]] England Collection Acquisition Committee. \n\n===Fairfield International and residency programme=== \nIn 2013, Gander and creative consultant Simon Turnbull proposed plans to open [http://fairfieldinternational.co.uk Fairfield International], a residential art school in a former primary school in [[Saxmundham]], Suffolk. Modelled on a hybrid of the Dutch academy and artist residency, Fairfield International would provide six residencies a year to hard-up artists in need of a retreat. \n\nWith no fees, students would receive a living stipend to participate in a non-instrumentalised, non-qualification approach to art education, foregrounding the work itself, minimising competitiveness of the British, particularly London-based, art school system. \u2018I think there are artists who come from situations that hold no other prerogative than to practice art. That sort of freedom is rare,\u2019 Gander told ''[[Artforum]]'' in 2013. Continuing, he said: \u2018I think that when one is in a situation in which they don\u2019t have to worry about time and space \u2013 two of the greatest denominators in an artist\u2019s ability to practice \u2013 that\u2019s when someone starts acting like a real artist. When you give young brilliant artists some time and space, everything else becomes contributing factors to their work.\u2019<ref> Ryan Gander, \u2018500 Words\u2019, As told to Huib Haye van der Werf, ''Artforum'', 7 Feb 2013: http://artforum.com/words/id=41715. Retrieved 25 Feb 2020.</ref>\n\nDespite raising funds for Fairfield International, the project was cancelled in 2015 due to a combination of factors, which Gander has written about in his book ''Fieldwork'': \u2018the bureaucracy of dealing with the county council over the purchase of the building\u2019 and \u2018the presence of something called \u201cknotweed\u201d on the site\u2019.<ref> Ryan Gander, \u2018Knotweed\u2019, ''Fieldwork, An incomplete reader'', Plazzy Banter, 2015</ref> At the time insurers would not offer indemnity against sites with knotweed. \n\nRecently, in 2020, Gander has begun publicly discussing his desire to open a residency programme in a village in Suffolk where his studio complex is situated. In a feature for the Suffolk Magazine he explained that he would make accommodation and studio space available for three artists for three months at a time. \u2018There are so many artists,\u2019 he told the magazine, \u2018with incredible potential but very limited means, so I would invite them to live and work here for free.\u2019<ref>Catherine Larner, 'Expect the unexpected', East Anglian Daily Times, Jan 2020.</ref>\n\n==Prizes and honours==\nSince 2001, Gander has been the recipient of numerous prestigious prizes and honours for contemporary art, notably: Arts Council of England International Fellowship, UK (2001-03); [[Prix de Rome|Prix De Rome]] for Sculpture, NL (2003); [[Beck's Futures|Beck\u2019s Futures]] Shortlist, ICA, London, UK (2005); BN AMRO Prize, NL; Baloise Art Statements Prize, Basel Art Fair, CH (both 2006); DENA Foundation Art Award, FR (2007); Paul Hamlyn Award, UK (2008); Nominee for The Times / South Bank Show Breakthrough Award, UK; Winner of the Zurich Art Prize, Haus Konstruktiv, CH (both 2009); and Pommery Prize Winner (2019).\n\t\t\nIn 2017, Gander was appointed Officer of the [http://www.art.mmu.ac.uk/news/item-4977/ Order of the British Empire] (OBE) in the New Year Honours for services to contemporary art.\n\n==Exhibitions==\nRyan Gander is represented by [[Lisson Gallery|Lisson gallery]], London, in the UK, gb agency, Paris, and Esther Schipper gallery, Berlin, on the continent, and TARO NASU, Tokyo, in Asia.
