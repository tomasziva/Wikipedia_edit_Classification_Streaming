Subsequently, their relationship improved after the Second World War and Talal was publicly declared heir apparent by the Emir.<ref>Glubb Pasha and the Arab Legion: Britain, Jordan and the End of Empire in the Middle East page 180</ref>\n\nTension between Emir Abdullah and then-Prince Talal continued, however, after Talal had been \"compiling huge, unexplainable debts\".<ref name=\"Arab Legion page 181\">Glubb Pasha and the Arab Legion: Britain, Jordan and the End of Empire in the Middle East page 181</ref> Both Emir Abdullah and Prime Minister [[Samir Al-Rifai]] were in favor of Talal's removal as heir apparent and replacement with his brother Naif. However, the British resident [[Alec Kirkbride]] warned Emir Abdullah against such a \"public rebuke of the heir to the throne\", a warning which Emir Abdullah reluctantly accepted and then proceeded to appoint Talal as regent when the Emir was on leave.<ref name=\"Arab Legion page 181\"/>\n\nA major reason for the British's reluctance to allow the replacement of Talal is his [[Talal of Jordan#Reign|well-publicized anti-British stance]] which caused the majority of Jordanians to assume that Kirkbride would favor the vigorously pro-British prince Naif. Thus, Kirkbride is said to have reasoned that Naif's \"accession would have been attributed by many Arabs to a Machiavellian plot on the part of the British government to exclude their enemy Talal\", an assumption that would give the Arab nationalist sympathetic public an impression that Britain still actively interfered in the affairs of newly-independent Jordan.<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59\">Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59</ref> Such assumption would disturb British interests as it may lead to renewed calls to remove British forces and fully remove British influence from the country.\n\nThis assumption would be put to a test when the Kirkbride sent Talal to a Beirut mental hospital, stating that Talal was suffering from severe mental illness. Many Jordanians believed that there was \"nothing wrong with Talal and that the wily British fabricated the story about his madness in order to get him out of the way.\"<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59\"/> Because of widespread popular opinion of Talal, Prince Naif was not given British support to succeed the Emir.\n\nThe conflicts between his two sons led Emir Abdullah to seek a secret union with Hashemite Iraq, in which Abdullah's nephew [[Faysal II of Iraq|Faysal II]] would rule Jordan after Abdullah's death. This idea received some positive reception among the British, but ultimately rejected as Baghdad's domination of Jordan was viewed as unfavorable by the British Foreign Office due to fear of \"Arab republicanism\".<ref>Glubb Pasha and the Arab Legion: Britain, Jordan and the End of Empire in the Middle East page 183, 186</ref>\n\nWith the two other possible claimants to the throne sidelined by the British (Prince Naif and King Faysal II of Iraq), Talal was poised to rule as king of Jordan upon Emir Abdullah's assassination in 1951. However, as Talal was receiving medical treatment abroad, Prince Naif was allowed to act as regent in his brother's place. Soon enough, Prince Naif began \"openly expressing his designs on the throne for himself\". Upon hearing of plans to bring Talal back to Jordan, Prince Naif attempted to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat by having Colonel [[Habis Majali]], commander of the 10th Infantry Regiment (described by [[Avi Shlaim]] as a \"quasi-[[Praetorian Guard]]\"<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 60\">Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 60</ref>), surround the palace of Queen Zein (wife of Talal)<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59\"/> and \"the building where the government was to meet in order to force it to crown Nayef\".<ref>Revolutions and Military Rule in the Middle East, page 488 https://books.google.com/books?id=g926AAAAIAAJ&q=habis+majali+prince+naif&dq=habis+majali+prince+naif&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHtJSjyJfjAhVGUlAKHZWbAoIQ6AEIMTAC</ref>\n\nThe coup, if it was a coup at all, failed due to lack of British support and  because of the interference of [[Glubb Pasha]] to stop it. Prince Naif left with his family to Beirut, his royal court advisor Mohammed Shureiki left his post, and the 10th Infantry Regiment was disbanded.<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 60\"/> Finally, King Talal assumed full duties as the successor to Emir Abdullah and king when he returned to Jordan on 6 September 1951.<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 60\"/>\n\n==Marriages and children==\nAbdullah married three times.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Jordan/jordan2.htm |title=Christopher Buyers, \"Al-Hashimi Dynasty Genealogy\" |access-date=11 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220846/http://4dw.net/royalark/Jordan/jordan2.htm |archive-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1904, Abdullah married his first wife, [[Musbah bint Nasser]] (1884 \u2013 15 March 1961), at Stinia Palace, [[\u0130stinye]], [[Istanbul]], [[Ottoman Empire]].

In 1967, el-Tell received a full pardon from King Hussein.\n\n===Succession crisis===\nEmir Abdullah I had two sons: future King [[Talal of Jordan|Talal]] and [[Prince Nayef bin Abdullah|Prince Naif]]. Talal, being the eldest son, was considered the \"natural heir to the throne\". However, Talal's troubled relationship with his father led Emir Abdullah to remove him from the line of succession in a secret royal decree during World War II. Subsequently, their relationship improved after the Second World War and Talal was publicly declared heir apparent by the Emir.<ref>Glubb Pasha and the Arab Legion: Britain, Jordan and the End of Empire in the Middle East page 180</ref>\n\nTension between Emir Abdullah and then-Prince Talal continued, however, after Talal had been \"compiling huge, unexplainable debts\".<ref name=\"Arab Legion page 181\">Glubb Pasha and the Arab Legion: Britain, Jordan and the End of Empire in the Middle East page 181</ref> Both Emir Abdullah and Prime Minister [[Samir Al-Rifai]] were in favor of Talal's removal as heir apparent and replacement with his brother Naif. However, the British resident [[Alec Kirkbride]] warned Emir Abdullah against such a \"public rebuke of the heir to the throne\", a warning which Emir Abdullah reluctantly accepted and then proceeded to appoint Talal as regent when the Emir was on leave.<ref name=\"Arab Legion page 181\"/>\n\nA major reason for the British's reluctance to allow the replacement of Talal is his [[Talal of Jordan#Reign|well-publicized anti-British stance]] which caused the majority of Jordanians to assume that Kirkbride would favor the vigorously pro-British prince Naif. Thus, Kirkbride is said to have reasoned that Naif's \"accession would have been attributed by many Arabs to a Machiavellian plot on the part of the British government to exclude their enemy Talal\", an assumption that would give the Arab nationalist sympathetic public an impression that Britain still actively interfered in the affairs of newly-independent Jordan.<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59\">Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59</ref> Such assumption would disturb British interests as it may lead to renewed calls to remove British forces and fully remove British influence from the country.\n\nThis assumption would be put to a test when the Kirkbride sent Talal to a Beirut mental hospital, stating that Talal was suffering from severe mental illness. Many Jordanians believed that there was \"nothing wrong with Talal and that the wily British fabricated the story about his madness in order to get him out of the way.\"<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59\"/> Because of widespread popular opinion of Talal, Prince Naif was not given British support to succeed the Emir.\n\nThe conflicts between his two sons led Emir Abdullah to seek a secret union with Hashemite Iraq, in which Abdullah's nephew [[Faysal II of Iraq|Faysal II]] would rule Jordan after Abdullah's death. This idea received some positive reception among the British, but ultimately rejected as Baghdad's domination of Jordan was viewed as unfavorable by the British Foreign Office due to fear of \"Arab republicanism\".<ref>Glubb Pasha and the Arab Legion: Britain, Jordan and the End of Empire in the Middle East page 183, 186</ref>\n\nWith the two other possible claimants to the throne sidelined by the British (Prince Naif and King Faysal II of Iraq), Talal was poised to rule as king of Jordan upon Emir Abdullah's assassination in 1951. However, as Talal was receiving medical treatment abroad, Prince Naif was allowed to act as regent in his brother's place. Soon enough, Prince Naif began \"openly expressing his designs on the throne for himself\". Upon hearing of plans to bring Talal back to Jordan, Prince Naif attempted to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat by having Colonel [[Habis Majali]], commander of the 10th Infantry Regiment (described by [[Avi Shlaim]] as a \"quasi-[[Praetorian Guard]]\"<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 60\">Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 60</ref>), surround the palace of Queen Zein (wife of Talal)<ref name=\"Shlaim: Lion of Jordan. pp 59\"/> and \"the building where the government was to meet in order to force it to crown Nayef\".<ref>Revolutions and Military Rule in the Middle East, page 488 https://books.google.com/books?id=g926AAAAIAAJ&q=habis+majali+prince+naif&dq=habis+majali+prince+naif&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHtJSjyJfjAhVGUlAKHZWbAoIQ6AEIMTAC</ref>\n\nThe coup, if it was a coup at all, failed due to lack of British support and  because of the interference of [[Glubb Pasha]] to stop it.
