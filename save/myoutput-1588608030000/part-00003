It is based upon the true story of [[Helmuth H\u00fcbener]], the youngest person to be sentenced to death by the Nazis during [[World War II]]. He was arrested and killed on October 27, 1942 sent to a death penalty by guillotine.<ref>{{citation |url= http://universe.byu.edu/2003/01/28/documentary-captures-antinazi-mormon-youths/ |title= Documentary captures anti-Nazi Mormon youths |first= Lisa |last= Millett |date= January 28, 2003 |newspaper= [[The Universe (BYU)|The Universe]] |publisher= [[Brigham Young University|BYU]] }}</ref>\n\nBartoletti fleshed out one episode from her non-fiction [[Newbery Honor Book]], ''[[Hitler Youth: Growing Up in Hitler's Shadow]]'' (2006), into this novel.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUQuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT137 | title=The Boy Who Dared | publisher=[[Scholastic.com]] | accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe majority of the story is told through flashbacks, as [[Helmuth H\u00fcbener]], charged with [[treason]], waits in a [[Berlin]] prison for his [[execution]]. Starting with his memories as a young boy, Helmuth recounts his childhood growing up  in [[Nazi Germany]] with his mother Mutti (German for \"Mom\"), grandparents, two brothers, his best friends Rudi and Karl and his future stepfather Hugo, a [[Nazi]] soldier.\n\nAs a young boy, Helmuth plans to become a soldier and fight for Germany but that changes when he grows up, and Helmuth stands out as a very intelligent young man. He becomes very opinionated about the Nazi government when he sees his Jewish classmate's father mercilessly murdered by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]].  Helmuth's brothers like Gerhard are separated as Gerhard goes to serve the country in marine work. He begins to secretly listen to forbidden enemy radio broadcasts, and enlists the help of two of his closest friends in distributing anti-Nazi material. Helmuth uses pamphlets to tell the truth about Hitler and the Nazis but ends up getting caught, because of his mistake, and he is executed by guillotine in Berlin, Germany.\n\n==Background==\nAfter Bartoletti finishing her non-fiction [[Newbery Honor Book]], ''[[Hitler Youth: Growing Up in Hitler's Shadow]]'' (2006), she wanted to expand on [[Helmuth H\u00fcbener]]'s \"amazing story\" and \"heroic actions\" into another book. She chose fiction to explore deeper what his thoughts may have been and raise \"questions about moral courage, nationalism, and the responsibility of the individual.\"<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nThis story about Helmuth H\u00fcbener chronicles his years in school and his first job after graduation. Helmuth took an apprenticeship in the Bieberhaus, which is at the Social Welfare Department at City Hall. Although originally proud of the Fatherland and an enthusiastic participant in the [[Jungvolk]], the [[Hitler Youth]] group, Helmuth became disillusioned as Nazi power and policies spread in Germany. Helmuth and a group of friends including [[Karl-Heinz Schnibbe]], Rudolf Wobbe, and Gerhard Duwer, monitored banned radio broadcasts, in which the Allied Powers gave an accurate portrayal of the war in Europe rather than the version told through Axis propaganda. The friends printed pamphlets that were critical of Nazi Germany and distributed them to the public. Their activities were discovered by a co-worker of Helmuth's at the Bieberhaus and they were turned in to the [[Gestapo]], where Helmuth was interrogated, beaten, and arrested for what was considered [[treason]]. Helmuth's friends received lighter sentences for their crimes. A brief trial for \"show\" was held at the People's Court or [[Volksgerichtshof]], and at age seventeen, Helmuth H\u00fcbener was executed at [[Plotzensee Prison]] in Berlin, becoming the youngest person in history executed for opposing the [[Third Reich]].
