Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the [[Early Bronze Age]] when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring [[equinox]]. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced [[sacred bull|various bull figures]] in the mythologies of Ancient [[Sumerian religion|Sumer]], [[Akkadian religion|Akkad]], [[Assyrian religion|Assyria]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylon]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek religion|Greece]], and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome]]. The symbol representing Taurus is [[Image:Taurus.svg|20px]] (Unicode \u2649), which resembles a bull's head.:<\n\nA number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest [[open cluster]]s to Earth, the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the [[red giant]] [[Aldebaran]] is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the [[supernova remnant]] [[Messier 1]], more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation. The [[variable star]] [[T Tauri]] is the prototype of a class of [[pre-main-sequence star]]s.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTaurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky, between [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] to the west and [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] to the east; to the north lies [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], to the southeast [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], to the south [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], and to the southwest [[Cetus]]. In late November-early December, Taurus reaches opposition (furthest point from the Sun) and is visible the entire night. By late March, it is setting at sunset and completely disappears behind the Sun's glare from May to July.<ref name=\"Garfinkle 1997\" />\n\nThis constellation forms part of the zodiac and hence is intersected by the [[ecliptic]]. This circle across the [[celestial sphere]] forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in the constellation Taurus during some part of each year.<ref name=\"Garfinkle 1997\" /> The [[galactic plane]] of the [[Milky Way]] intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the [[galactic anticenter]] is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as [[Gould's Belt]] passes through the constellation.<ref name=\"crossen_rhemann2004\" />\n\nThe recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is \"Tau\".<ref name=\"pa30_469\" /> The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eug\u00e8ne Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|03|23.4}} and {{RA|05|53.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 31.10\u00b0 and \u22121.35\u00b0.<ref name=\"boundary\" /> Because a small part of the constellation lies to the south of the [[celestial equator]], this can not be a completely [[circumpolar constellation]] at any latitude.<ref name=\"seeds2007\" />\n\n==Features==\n\n[[File:TaurusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Taurus as it can be seen by the naked eye.<ref name=\"allthesky\" /> The constellation lines have been added for clarity.]]\n\nDuring November, the [[Taurid]] [[meteor shower]] appears to radiate from the general direction of this constellation. The [[Beta Taurid]] meteor shower occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques.<ref name=\"lewis1997\" /> Between 18 and 29 October, both the [[Northern Taurids]] and the [[Southern Taurids]] are active; though the latter stream is stronger.<ref>{{cite journal |journal = Sky & Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 22 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}</ref> However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.<ref>{{cite journal |journal = Sky & Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 23 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}</ref>\n\nThe brightest member of this constellation is [[Aldebaran]], an orange-hued, [[spectral class]] K5&nbsp;III [[giant star]].<ref name=\"Burnham\" /> Its name derives from '''{{lang|ar|[[wikt:\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646|\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646]]}}''' ''{{transl|ar|al-dabar\u0101n}}'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for \"the follower\", probably from the fact that it follows the [[Pleiades]] during the nightly motion of the  [[celestial sphere]] across the sky.{{sfn|Chartrand|1993|p=188}}<ref name=\"schaff\" />{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=383}} Forming the profile of a Bull's face is a ''V'' or ''K''-shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]],<ref name=\"Olcott\" /> the nearest distinct open [[star cluster]] after the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]].<ref name=\"inglis2004\" /> In this profile, Aldebaran forms the bull's bloodshot eye, which has been described as \"glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion\",<ref name=\"saski_boddy2003\" /> a constellation that lies just to the southwest. The Hyades span about 5\u00b0 of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2003|p=55}} It includes a naked eye double star, [[Theta Tauri]] (the proper name of Theta<sup>2</sup> Tauri is ''Chakumuy'')<ref name=\"IAU-LSN\"/>, with a separation of 5.6&nbsp;[[arcminutes]].<ref name=\"kaler_theta_tauri\" />\n\nIn the northeastern quadrant of the Taurus constellation lie the [[Pleiades]] ([[Messier object|M45]]), one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the naked eye. The seven most prominent stars in this cluster are at least visual [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] six, and so the cluster is also named the \"Seven Sisters\". However, many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope.<ref name=\"marx_pfau_lamble1992\" /> Astronomers estimate that the cluster has approximately 500-1,000 stars, all of which are around 100 million years old. However, they vary considerably in type. The Pleiades themselves are represented by large, bright stars; also many small [[brown dwarf]]s and [[white dwarf]]s exist. The cluster is estimated to dissipate in another 250 million years.<ref name=\"objects\" /> The Pleiades cluster is classified as a Shapley class c and Trumpler class I 3 r n cluster, indicating that it is irregularly shaped and loose, though concentrated at its center and detached from the star-field.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=94}}\n\n===Deep-sky objects===\n\nIn the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of [[NGC 1514]]. This [[planetary nebula]] is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer [[William Herschel]] in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that [[nebula]]e were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer [[William Huggins]] used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nTo the west, the two horns of the bull are formed by [[Beta Tauri|Beta (\u03b2) Tauri]] and [[Zeta Tauri|Zeta (\u03b6) Tauri]]; two star systems that are separated by 8\u00b0. Beta is a white, spectral class B7 III giant star known as ''El Nath'', which comes from the Arabic phrase \"the butting\", as in butting by the horns of the bull.{{sfn|Chartrand|1993|p=184}} At magnitude 1.65, it is the second brightest star in the constellation, and shares the border with the neighboring constellation of [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. As a result, it also bears the designation Gamma Aurigae. Zeta Tauri (the proper name is ''Tianguan''<ref name=\"IAU-LSN\">{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/ | title=Naming Stars |publisher=IAU.org |accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>) is an [[eclipsing binary]] star that completes an orbit every 133 days.<ref name=\"Burnham\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-right: 0; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|+ Brightest NGC objects in Taurus<!-- Magnitude 11 or brighter --><ref name=\"Gilmour2012\"/>\n|-\n!

This expanding [[nebula]] was created by a [[Type II supernova]] explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak, the supernova reached magnitude \u22124, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe.<ref name=\"hawkins2002\" /><ref name=\"covington2002\" /> [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American peoples]] also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when [[John Bevis]] found it.<ref name=\"objects\" />\n\nThe star [[Lambda Tauri|Lambda (\u03bb) Tauri]] is an eclipsing binary star. This system consists of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The [[orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of their orbit]] lies almost along the line of sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 [[astronomical unit]]s, so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.<ref name=\"apj263_289\" />\n\n[[File:Central area of constellation Taurus.jpg|thumb|Central area of constellation Taurus, showing [[Aldebaran]] at the lower left.]]\n\nLocated about 1.8\u00b0 west of [[Epsilon Tauri|Epsilon (\u03b5) Tauri]] is [[T Tauri]], the prototype of a class of [[variable star]]s called [[T Tauri star]]s. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between [[visual magnitude|magnitude]] 9 to 13 over a period of weeks or months.<ref name=\"Garfinkle 1997\" /> This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a [[main sequence]] star.<ref name=\"araa27_1_351\" /> The surrounding [[reflection nebula]] [[NGC 1555]] is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity.<ref name=\"noao_1555\" /> To the north lies [[Kappa Tauri]], a visual [[double star]] consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|p=475}}\n\n[[File:Nebula in Taurus.jpg|thumb|[[IRAS 05437+2502]], a nebula]]\n\nThis constellation includes part of the Taurus-Auriga complex, or Taurus dark clouds, a star-forming region containing sparse, filamentary clouds of gas and dust. This spans a diameter of {{Convert|98|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} and contains 35,000&nbsp;[[solar mass]]es of material, which is both larger and less massive than the [[Orion Nebula]].<ref name=\"schulz2005\" /> At a distance of {{Convert|490|ly|pc|abbr=off}}, this is one of the nearest active star forming regions.<ref name=\"babu_feigelson1996\" /> Located in this region, about 10\u00b0 to the northeast of Aldebaran, is an asterism [[NGC 1746]] spanning a width of 45 [[arcminute]]s.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|p=84}}\n\n==History and mythology==\n\n{{see also|Bull (mythology)}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 250\n| image1    = Constellation Taureau_-_al-Sufi.jpg\n| caption1  = Taurus as depicted in the astronomical treatise ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'' by the Persian astronomer [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]], c. 964.\n| image2    = Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Taurus.jpg\n| caption2  = Taurus as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825.\n}}\n\nThe identification of the [[constellation]] of Taurus with a bull is very old, certainly dating to the [[Chalcolithic]], and perhaps even to the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Michael Rappengl\u00fcck of the [[University of Munich]] believes that Taurus is represented in a [[cave painting]] at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at [[Lascaux]] (dated to roughly 15,000 BC), which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades.<ref name=\"arxiv0810.1592\" /><ref name=\"whitehouse20000809\" /> The name \"seven sisters\" has been used for the Pleiades in the languages of many cultures, including indigenous groups of [[Australia]], [[North America]] and [[Siberia]]. This suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin.<ref name=\"brown2008\" />\n\nTaurus marked the point of [[vernal equinox|vernal (spring) equinox]] in the [[Chalcolithic]] and the [[Early Bronze Age]], from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].<ref name=\"noonan05\" /> The Pleiades were closest to the Sun at vernal equinox around the [[23rd century BC]]. In [[Babylonian astronomy]], the constellation was listed in the [[MUL.APIN]] as  {{lang|sux-Latn|GU<sub>4</sub>.AN.NA}}, \"The [[Bull of Heaven]]\".<ref name=\"rogers1998\" /> It has been claimed that \"when the Babylonians first set up their zodiac, the vernal equinox lay in Taurus.\"<ref name=wilson1997/> This is in fact incorrect: when the MUL.APIN tablets were compiled in ~1100-700 BC<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rogers |first1=J.

Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], facing Taurus as if in combat,<ref name=\"ns120_36\" /> while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian religion|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for \"star-constellation\"), there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.<ref name=\"white2008\" />\n\nThe same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the [[Dendera zodiac]], an [[Egypt]]ian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the [[celestial hemisphere]] using a [[planisphere]]. In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward.<ref name=\"jbaa108_1_9\" /> To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began. This \"sacrifice\" led to the renewal of the land.<ref name=\"ptak1998\" /> To the early [[Hebrews]], Taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet, [[Aleph]].{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=381}}\n\nIn 1990, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the position of the Sun on the first day of summer (June 21) crossed the IAU boundary of Gemini into Taurus.<ref>''The Griffith Observer'' 61 (Sept. 1997), 14.

In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation is depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife [[Hera]], Zeus changed Io into the form of a heifer.<ref name=\"ridpath2018\" /> Greek mythographer [[Acusilaus]] marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the [[Cretan Bull]], one of [[Labors of Hercules|The Twelve Labors]] of [[Heracles]].<ref name=\"palaephatus_stern1996\" />\n\nTaurus became an important object of worship among the [[Druid]]s. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation.<ref name=\"noonan05\" /> Among the arctic people known as the [[Inuit]], the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing the spirit of the [[polar bear]].

celestial hemisphere]].  Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the [[Early Bronze Age]] when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring [[equinox]]. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced [[sacred bull|various bull figures]] in the mythologies of Ancient [[Sumerian religion|Sumer]], [[Akkadian religion|Akkad]], [[Assyrian religion|Assyria]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylon]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek religion|Greece]], and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome]]. The symbol representing Taurus is [[Image:Taurus.svg|20px]] (Unicode \u2649), which resembles a bull's head.\n\nA number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest [[open cluster]]s to Earth, the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the [[red giant]] [[Aldebaran]] is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the [[supernova remnant]] [[Messier 1]], more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation. The [[variable star]] [[T Tauri]] is the prototype of a class of [[pre-main-sequence star]]s.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTaurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky, between [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] to the west and [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] to the east; to the north lies [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], to the southeast [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], to the south [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], and to the southwest [[Cetus]]. In late November-early December, Taurus reaches opposition (furthest point from the Sun) and is visible the entire night. By late March, it is setting at sunset and completely disappears behind the Sun's glare from May to July.<ref name=\"Garfinkle 1997\" />\n\nThis constellation forms part of the zodiac and hence is intersected by the [[ecliptic]]. This circle across the [[celestial sphere]] forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in the constellation Taurus during some part of each year.<ref name=\"Garfinkle 1997\" /> The [[galactic plane]] of the [[Milky Way]] intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the [[galactic anticenter]] is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as [[Gould's Belt]] passes through the constellation.<ref name=\"crossen_rhemann2004\" />\n\nThe recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is \"Tau\".<ref name=\"pa30_469\" /> The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eug\u00e8ne Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 segments.

However, many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope.<ref name=\"marx_pfau_lamble1992\" /> Astronomers estimate that the cluster has approximately 500-1,000 stars, all of which are around 100 million years old. However, they vary considerably in type. The Pleiades themselves are represented by large, bright stars; also many small [[brown dwarf]]s and [[white dwarf]]s exist. The cluster is estimated to dissipate in another 250 million years.<ref name=\"objects\" /> The Pleiades cluster is classified as a Shapley class c and Trumpler class I 3 r n cluster, indicating that it is irregularly shaped and loose, though concentrated at its center and detached from the star-field.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=94}}\n\n===Deep-sky objects===\n\nIn the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of [[NGC 1514]]. This [[planetary nebula]] is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer [[William Herschel]] in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that [[nebula]]e were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer [[William Huggins]] used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.{{sfn|O'Meara|2011|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nTo the west, the two horns of the bull are formed by [[Beta Tauri|Beta (\u03b2) Tauri]] and [[Zeta Tauri|Zeta (\u03b6) Tauri]]; two star systems that are separated by 8\u00b0.

This expanding [[nebula]] was created by a [[Type II supernova]] explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak, the supernova reached magnitude \u22124, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe.<ref name=\"hawkins2002\" /><ref name=\"covington2002\" /> [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American peoples]] also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when [[John Bevis]] found it.<ref name=\"objects\" />\n\nThe star [[Lambda Tauri|Lambda (\u03bb) Tauri]] is an eclipsing binary star. This system consists of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The [[orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of their orbit]] lies almost along the line of sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 [[astronomical unit]]s, so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction.

Michael Rappengl\u00fcck of the [[University of Munich]] believes that Taurus is represented in a [[cave painting]] at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at [[Lascaux]] (dated to roughly 15,000 BC), which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades.<ref name=\"arxiv0810.1592\" /><ref name=\"whitehouse20000809\" /> The name \"seven sisters\" has been used for the Pleiades in the languages of many cultures, including indigenous groups of [[Australia]], [[North America]] and [[Siberia]]. This suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin.<ref name=\"brown2008\" />\n\nTaurus marked the point of [[vernal equinox|vernal (spring) equinox]] in the [[Chalcolithic]] and the [[Early Bronze Age]], from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].<ref name=\"noonan05\" /> The Pleiades were closest to the Sun at vernal equinox around the [[23rd century BC]].

Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], facing Taurus as if in combat,<ref name=\"ns120_36\" /> while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian religion|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for \"star-constellation\"), there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.<ref name=\"white2008\" />\n\nThe same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the [[Dendera zodiac]], an [[Egypt]]ian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the [[celestial hemisphere]] using a [[planisphere]]. In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward.<ref name=\"jbaa108_1_9\" /> To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began. This \"sacrifice\" led to the renewal of the land.<ref name=\"ptak1998\" /> To the early [[Hebrews]], Taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet, [[Aleph]].{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=381}}\n\nIn 1990, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the position of the Sun on the first day of summer (June 21) crossed the IAU boundary of Gemini into Taurus.<ref>''The Griffith Observer'' 61 (Sept. 1997), 14.
