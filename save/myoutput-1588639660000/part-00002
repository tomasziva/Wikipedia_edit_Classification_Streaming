A supervising criminologist at the San Francisco Police Department crime lab testified that the gun was in excellent condition and would not have fired without someone pulling the trigger. The defense emphasized that the Sig Sauer pistol has no external [[Safety (firearms)|safety mechanism]] to prevent accidental firing, and pointed to a record of even police trained in the use of Sig Sauer pistols having made accidental discharges. As examined by the criminologist, it was placed in single-action mode (where the hammer is cocked), rather than double-action mode (where a single pull of the trigger both cocks and releases the hammer). While it is typical for a gun that has been fired to be in single-action mode, a gun in single-action mode also requires less trigger pressure to fire. The defense argued that this made it more plausible that Garc\u00eda Z\u00e1rate could have pulled the trigger accidentally while picking up or unwrapping the bundled gun. Woychowski, a BLM ranger, testified that he always left the pistol in double-action mode, but that he typically loaded it in single-action mode, and couldn't definitively say that he had returned it to double-action mode before it was stolen.<ref name=\"SFGateTrigger\"/>  The defense rested its case after four days.<ref name=\"DefenseRest\">{{cite news|title=Defense Rests Case In Steinle Shooting Trial|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/11/09/defense-rests-case-in-steinle-shooting-trial/|work=5 KPIX CBS|date=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"JurySeeks\">{{cite news|last1=Ho|first1=Vivian|title=In Steinle murder trial, jurors must seek truth within tragic and 'bizarre' shooting|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/In-Steinle-murder-trial-jurors-must-seek-truth-12351881.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to closing arguments, Judge James Feng agreed to a request by the prosecutor Diana Garcia to instruct the jury in first-degree murder as well as second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. \"The jury will be instructed on multiple theories of homicide,\" said District Attorney's Office spokesman Alex Bastian.<ref name=\"ThreeCharges\">{{cite news|last1=Gaiser|first1=Sara|title=Steinle trial jurors allowed to consider first-degree murder|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/bay_area/steinle-trial-jurors-allowed-to-consider-first-degree-murder/article_682ba418-cb46-11e7-833f-e3ac71aafba3.html|work=The Daily Journal|date=November 16, 2017|location=San Mateo, California|quote=... instruct the jury in first-degree murder as well as second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter}}</ref><ref name=\"FirstDegree\">{{cite news|title=Jurors Allowed to Consider First-Degree Murder Verdict in Kate Steinle Trial|url=https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Jurors-Allowed-to-Consider-First-Degree-Murder-Verdict-in-Kate-Steinle-Trial-458233933.html|work=NBC Bay Area|date=November 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJury deliberations began after 12 days of testimony, dozens of witnesses and two days of closing arguments on November 21, 2017.<ref name=\"JuryDeliberates\">{{cite news|last1=Barba|first1=Michael|title=Jury begins to deliberate in Kate Steinle murder trial|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/jury-begins-deliberate-kate-steinle-murder-trial/|work=San Francisco Examiner|date=November 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"DeliberateFive\">{{cite news|last1=Ruggiero|first1=Angela|title=Kate Steinle murder trial: Fifth day of deliberations, but no verdict yet|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/29/kate-steinle-murder-trial-fifth-day-of-deliberations-but-no-verdict-yet/|work=The Mercury News|date=November 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn November 30, 2017, after five days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Garc\u00eda Z\u00e1rate of all murder and manslaughter charges, but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.<ref name=\"Acquitted\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/kate-steinle-murder-trial.html|title=Trump Tweets 'Build the Wall' After Immigrant Is Acquitted in Kathryn Steinle Case|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt|date=November 30, 2017|work=The New York Times|last2=Fuller|first2=Thomas|last3=Dickerson|first3=Caitlan}}</ref>\n\nThe Department of Justice unsealed a federal arrest warrant for Garc\u00eda Z\u00e1rate following his trial.

A supervising criminologist at the San Francisco Police Department crime lab testified that the gun was in excellent condition and would not have fired without someone pulling the trigger. The defense emphasized that the Sig Sauer pistol has no external [[Safety (firearms)|safety mechanism]] to prevent accidental firing, and pointed to a record of even police trained in the use of Sig Sauer pistols having made accidental discharges. As examined by the criminologist, it was placed in single-action mode (where the hammer is cocked), rather than double-action mode (where a single pull of the trigger both cocks and releases the hammer). While it is typical for a gun that has been fired to be in single-action mode, a gun in single-action mode also requires less trigger pressure to fire. The defense argued that this made it more plausible that Garc\u00eda Z\u00e1rate could have pulled the trigger accidentally while picking up or unwrapping the bundled gun. Woychowski, a BLM ranger, testified that he always left the pistol in double-action mode, but that he typically loaded it in single-action mode, and couldn't definitively say that he had returned it to double-action mode before it was stolen.<ref name=\"SFGateTrigger\"/>  The defense rested its case after four days.<ref name=\"DefenseRest\">{{cite news|title=Defense Rests Case In Steinle Shooting Trial|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/11/09/defense-rests-case-in-steinle-shooting-trial/|work=5 KPIX CBS|date=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"JurySeeks\">{{cite news|last1=Ho|first1=Vivian|title=In Steinle murder trial, jurors must seek truth within tragic and 'bizarre' shooting|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/In-Steinle-murder-trial-jurors-must-seek-truth-12351881.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to closing arguments, Judge James Feng agreed to a request by the prosecutor Diana Garcia to instruct the jury in first-degree murder as well as second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. \"The jury will be instructed on multiple theories of homicide,\" said District Attorney's Office spokesman Alex Bastian.<ref name=\"ThreeCharges\">{{cite news|last1=Gaiser|first1=Sara|title=Steinle trial jurors allowed to consider first-degree murder|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/bay_area/steinle-trial-jurors-allowed-to-consider-first-degree-murder/article_682ba418-cb46-11e7-833f-e3ac71aafba3.html|work=The Daily Journal|date=November 16, 2017|location=San Mateo, California|quote=... instruct the jury in first-degree murder as well as second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter}}</ref><ref name=\"FirstDegree\">{{cite news|title=Jurors Allowed to Consider First-Degree Murder Verdict in Kate Steinle Trial|url=https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Jurors-Allowed-to-Consider-First-Degree-Murder-Verdict-in-Kate-Steinle-Trial-458233933.html|work=NBC Bay Area|date=November 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJury deliberations began after 12 days of testimony, dozens of witnesses and two days of closing arguments on November 21, 2017.<ref name=\"JuryDeliberates\">{{cite news|last1=Barba|first1=Michael|title=Jury begins to deliberate in Kate Steinle murder trial|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/jury-begins-deliberate-kate-steinle-murder-trial/|work=San Francisco Examiner|date=November 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"DeliberateFive\">{{cite news|last1=Ruggiero|first1=Angela|title=Kate Steinle murder trial: Fifth day of deliberations, but no verdict yet|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/29/kate-steinle-murder-trial-fifth-day-of-deliberations-but-no-verdict-yet/|work=The Mercury News|date=November 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn November 30, 2017, after five days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Garc\u00eda Z\u00e1rate of all murder and manslaughter charges, but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.<ref name=\"Acquitted\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/kate-steinle-murder-trial.html|title=Trump Tweets 'Build the Wall' After Immigrant Is Acquitted in Kathryn Steinle Case|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt|date=November 30, 2017|work=The New York Times|last2=Fuller|first2=Thomas|last3=Dickerson|first3=Caitlan}}</ref>\n\nThe Department of Justice unsealed a federal arrest warrant for Garc\u00eda Z\u00e1rate following his trial.
