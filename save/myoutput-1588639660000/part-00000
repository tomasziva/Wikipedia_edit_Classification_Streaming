It is also considered as one of the richest when it comes to cultural heritage in the entire province. The town is also dubbed to be the \"Old Lady in the Northwestern province of Tarlac\" because it is one of the oldest municipality created by the Spanish government under the province of Pangasinan where it previously included the former barrio of Mayantoc, San Clemente, and Santa Ignacia. The municipality also features cultural antiquity such as its churches, ancestral houses, and ruins. However, the baroque church of Camiling has yet to be restored after 20 years since a fire burned its interior. The inside of the church, one of the only two Spanish churches left in Tarlac, has become a cesspool for human waste, while the facade (front) and buttresses (side supports) have been occupied by business establishments. One buttress has been converted by a business store into a toilet.

When the polity of [[Caboloan]] was established in 1406, the area was incorporated as part of the kingdom. It was ruled by a series of native huangs (kings/queens), namely, [[Urduja]], Kamayin, Taymey, and Liyu. Majority of its rulers are unnamed as no document of them were properly recorded. For a short period, an emperor in China became an honorary ruler as well. In 1575, the Chinese pirate [[Limahong]] attacked the polity and declared himself as ruler of the Caboloan realms. The kingdom was eventually abolished in 1576, when the Spanish attacked and ransacked the kingdom's capital of Binalatongan (present-day [[San Carlos, Pangasinan]]). It was later on incorporated into the Spanish Empire.\n\nEarly in the 18th century, the community was a [[sitio]] of [[Paniqui, Tarlac|Paniqui]]; before and after, Paniqui was also part of [[Bayambang, Pangasinan]]. The town's name is derived from a tree called ''[[Semecarpus|kamiring]]'' which at that time grew abundantly in the wilderness<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpi.da.gov.ph/Publications/mp/pdf/l/ligas.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720134351/http://www.bpi.da.gov.ph/Publications/mp/pdf/l/ligas.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and subsequently changed to Camiling.\n\nThe community was originally a vast area of Cogon growth interposed with thick forestalls areas stretching into the [[Zambales]] mountain ranges. A wide river cut through it. The early inhabitants of the place were the [[Aeta]]s who make a living by gathering fruit from fruit trees, hunting, and fishing. With the coming first of the [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinenses]] and later the [[Ilokano people|Ilocanos]] from the north, the Aetas who used to roam freely in the wilderness obliged themselves to move into the interior. The new settlers first occupied the swampy land, now known as \"Cacamilingan\" on the right side of the river. In time, these settlers began moving to the left opposite shore because of more frequent disastrous floods. To this new location, the residents therein built a small church with [[Saint Michael]] as the patron saint.\n\nCamiling became a District Commission from 1834 to 1837 founded by Don Francisco Soriano, the then [[Cabeza de Barangay]] who became the town's first District Commissioner. In 1838, Camiling became an independent town, formally separated from the mother town of Paniqui and with Don Vicente Galsim, as the first [[Gobernadorcillo]]. Thirty-eight others followed him. Don Jose Sabado, the last to serve under the Spanish regime and the first Presidente Municipal under the Revolutionary Government by Aguinaldo.\n\nCamiling was a first-class municipality during the 1970s but was reclassified when the Local Government Code went into effect in the early 1990s. It became again a first-class municipality again on November 20, 2001, by virtue of the Latest Income Class Classification (L.I.C.C.) initiated by the Department of Finance; the Local Government Unit of Camiling was reclassified from a second class municipality to a first-class municipality, having attained an annual income of 50,942,508.51 pesos. In 2008, Camiling's income was more than 72,463,893,00 pesos with average growth of more than 5.164% per year (2001\u20132008).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Camiling\n| 1903 = 25243\n| 1918 = 23375\n| 1939 = 25824\n| 1948 = 33935\n| 1960 = 40536\n| 1970 = 49156\n| 1975 = 52411\n| 1980 = 53860\n| 1990 = 62773\n| 1995 = 65340\n| 2000 = 71598\n| 2007 = 79941\n| 2010 = 80241\n| 2015 = 83248\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Camiling, Tarlac, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n=== Language ===\nMany old town's districts are based on the [[Pangasinan language]] like Anoling, Cayaoan (Bamboo), Libueg, Lasong, Tuec (to nod), Pindangan, Telbang.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nCamiling is one of the fastest-growing towns of Tarlac when it comes to income and economy. It is also considered as one of the richest when it comes to cultural heritage in the entire province. The town is also dubbed to be the \"Old Lady in the Northwestern province of Tarlac\" because it is one of the oldest municipality created by the Spanish government under the province of Pangasinan where it previously included the former barrio of Mayantoc, San Clemente, and Santa Ignacia. The municipality also features cultural antiquity such as its churches, ancestral houses, and ruins. However, the baroque church of Camiling has yet to be restored after 20 years since a fire burned its interior. The inside of the church, one of the only two Spanish churches left in Tarlac, has become a cesspool for human waste, while the facade (front) and buttresses (side supports) have been occupied by business establishments. One buttress has been converted by a business store into a toilet. Heritage advocates and Camiling locals have been campaigning for the restoration of the church after the reports came out in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/289373/camiling-church-gutted-forgotten-reused-public-toilet/ |title = Camiling Church: Gutted, forgotten, 'reused' as public toilet|date = 2018-03-18}}</ref>\n\nCamiling is the major north-western municipality in Tarlac.

It is the commercial center of an area composed of about eight towns, and borders the province of Pangasinan. It is the gateway to central and western Pangasinan through the [[Romulo Highway]] (formerly Highway 13). It borders San Clemente on the west, Bayambang from the north, Santa Ignacia and Mayantoc to the south and Paniqui and Moncada by the east. It is also known for its famous \"Chicharon Camiling\" and its green native rice cake called \"Nilubyan\".\n\n== Geography ==\nMostly of plain topography but some parts are hilly to mountainous in which the barangays of Papaac, Bacsay, Birbira and Cayasan, to name a few.

When the polity of [[Caboloan]] was established in 1406, the area was incorporated as part of the kingdom. It was ruled by a series of native huangs (kings/queens), namely, [[Urduja]], Kamayin, Taymey, and Liyu. Majority of its rulers are unnamed as no document of them were properly recorded. For a short period, an emperor in China became an honorary ruler as well. In 1575, the Chinese pirate [[Limahong]] attacked the polity and declared himself as ruler of the Caboloan realms. The kingdom was eventually abolished in 1576, when the Spanish attacked and ransacked the kingdom's capital of Binalatongan (present-day [[San Carlos, Pangasinan]]). It was later on incorporated into the Spanish Empire.\n\nEarly in the 18th century, the community was a [[sitio]] of [[Paniqui, Tarlac|Paniqui]]; before and after, Paniqui was also part of [[Bayambang, Pangasinan]]. The town's name is derived from a tree called ''[[Semecarpus|kamiring]]'' which at that time grew abundantly in the wilderness<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpi.da.gov.ph/Publications/mp/pdf/l/ligas.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720134351/http://www.bpi.da.gov.ph/Publications/mp/pdf/l/ligas.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and subsequently changed to Camiling.\n\nThe community was originally a vast area of Cogon growth interposed with thick forestalls areas stretching into the [[Zambales]] mountain ranges. A wide river cut through it. The early inhabitants of the place were the [[Aeta]]s who make a living by gathering fruit from fruit trees, hunting, and fishing. With the coming first of the [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinenses]] and later the [[Ilokano people|Ilocanos]] from the north, the Aetas who used to roam freely in the wilderness obliged themselves to move into the interior. The new settlers first occupied the swampy land, now known as \"Cacamilingan\" on the right side of the river. In time, these settlers began moving to the left opposite shore because of more frequent disastrous floods. To this new location, the residents therein built a small church with [[Saint Michael]] as the patron saint.\n\nCamiling became a District Commission from 1834 to 1837 founded by Don Francisco Soriano, the then [[Cabeza de Barangay]] who became the town's first District Commissioner. In 1838, Camiling became an independent town, formally separated from the mother town of Paniqui and with Don Vicente Galsim, as the first [[Gobernadorcillo]]. Thirty-eight others followed him. Don Jose Sabado, the last to serve under the Spanish regime and the first Presidente Municipal under the Revolutionary Government by Aguinaldo.\n\nCamiling was a first-class municipality during the 1970s but was reclassified when the Local Government Code went into effect in the early 1990s. It became again a first-class municipality again on November 20, 2001, by virtue of the Latest Income Class Classification (L.I.C.C.) initiated by the Department of Finance; the Local Government Unit of Camiling was reclassified from a second class municipality to a first-class municipality, having attained an annual income of 50,942,508.51 pesos. In 2008, Camiling's income was more than 72,463,893,00 pesos with average growth of more than 5.164% per year (2001\u20132008).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Camiling\n| 1903 = 25243\n| 1918 = 23375\n| 1939 = 25824\n| 1948 = 33935\n| 1960 = 40536\n| 1970 = 49156\n| 1975 = 52411\n| 1980 = 53860\n| 1990 = 62773\n| 1995 = 65340\n| 2000 = 71598\n| 2007 = 79941\n| 2010 = 80241\n| 2015 = 83248\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Camiling, Tarlac, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n=== Language ===\nMany old town's districts are based on the [[Pangasinan language]] like Anoling, Cayaoan (Bamboo), Libueg, Lasong, Tuec (to nod), Pindangan, Telbang. Others are named after towns of Ilocos where the other settlers originally came from.
