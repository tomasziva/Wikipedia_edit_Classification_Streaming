It has a large, flat, paddle-shaped tail and large, webbed hind feet. The unwebbed front paws are smaller, with claws. The forepaws are highly dextrous, and are used both for digging, and to fold individual leaves into their mouth and to rotate small, pencil-sized stems as they gnaw off bark.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=B.W.|last2=Hill|first2=E.P.|date=2003|editor-last=Feldhammer|editor2-last=Thompson|editor3-last=Chapman|title=Beaver (Castor canadensis)|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/beaver_damage/downloads/Baker%20and%20Hill%20Beaver%20Chapter.pdf|journal=Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Conservation|edition=Second|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland, USA|pages=288\u2013310|via=USDA APHIS}}</ref> The eyes are covered by a [[nictitating membrane]] which allows the beaver to see under water.

The fur has a range of colors, but usually is dark brown. [[Scent gland]]s near the genitals secrete an oily substance known as [[castoreum]], which the beaver uses to waterproof its fur. There is also another set of oil glands producing unique chemical identifiers in the form of waxy esters and fatty acids.<ref name=\":0\" /> The lush, workable fur was made into a number of products, most notably [[beaver hat|hats]]. Demand for furs for hats drove beavers nearly to the point of extinction, and the North American species was saved principally by a sudden change in style. Before their near-[[Local extinction|extirpation]] by trapping in North America, beavers were practically ubiquitous and lived from the [[tundra|arctic tundra]] to the deserts of northern [[Mexico]], and from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Beaver and his Works |author=Morgan, Lewis H. |year=1868 |publisher=J.

Beavers are well known for building [[dam]]s across streams and constructing their lodges in the artificial ponds which form. When building in a pond, the beavers first make a pile of sticks and then eat out one or more underwater entrances and two platforms above the water surface inside the pile. The first is used for drying off. Towards winter, the lodge is often plastered with mud which, when it freezes, has the consistency of concrete. A small air hole is left in the top of the lodge.\n\n=== Dam-building ===\nThe purpose of the [[Beaver dam|dam]] is to create deepwater refugia enabling the beaver to escape from predators. When deep water is already present in lakes, rivers, or larger streams, the beaver may dwell in a bank burrow and bank lodge with an underwater entrance. The beaver dam is constructed using branches from trees the beavers cut down, as well as rocks, grass, and mud. The inner bark, twigs, shoots, and leaves of such trees are also an important part of the beaver's diet.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An extensive study of the foraging ecology of beavers (''Castor canadensis'') in relation to habitat quality |author1=Gallant, D. |author2=B\u00e9rub\u00e9, C.H. |author3=Tremblay, E. |author4=Vasseur, L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004 |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |url=http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/courses/BI312/upload/ForagingBeaversHabitatQuality.pdf |volume=82|pages=922\u2013933 |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |doi=10.1139/z04-067 |issue=6 }}</ref> The trees are cut down using their strong [[incisor]] teeth. Their front paws are used for digging and carrying and placing materials. The sound of running water dictates when and where a beaver builds its dam. Besides providing a safe home for the beaver, beaver ponds also provide habitat for [[waterfowl]], [[fish]], and other aquatic animals. Their dams help reduce soil [[erosion]] and can help reduce flooding. However, beaver dams are not permanent and depend on the beavers' continued presence for their maintenance. Beavers generally concentrate on building and repairing dams in the fall in preparation for the coming winter. In northern areas, they often do not repair breaches in the dam made by otters, and sometimes breach the dam themselves and lower the water level in the pond to create more breathing space under the ice or get easier access to trees below the dam. In a 1988 study in Alberta, Canada, no beavers repaired \"sites of water loss\" during the winter. Of 178 sites of water loss, beavers repaired 78 when water was opened, and did not repair 68. The rest were partially repaired.<ref>Donald G. Reid, Stephen M. Herrero and Thomas E. Code, \"River Otters as Agents of Water Loss from Beaver Ponds,\" Journal of Mammalogy, February 1988.</ref>\n\nBeavers are best known for their dam-building. They maintain their pond-habitat by reacting quickly to the sound of running water, and damming it up with tree branches and mud. Early ecologists believed that this dam-building was an amazing feat of architectural planning, indicative of the beaver's high intellect. This theory was tested when a recording of running water was played in a field near a beaver pond. Although it was on dry land, the beaver covered the tape player with branches and mud.<ref name = Richard>{{cite journal | author = Richard P.B. | year = 1983 | title = Mechanisms and adaptation in the constructive behavior of the beaver (C. fiber L.) | journal = Acta Zoologica Fennica | volume = 174 | pages = 105\u2013108 }}</ref> The largest beaver dam is {{convert|2790|ft|abbr=on}} in length\u2014more than half a mile long\u2014and was discovered via satellite imagery in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thie, Jean  |url=http://www.geostrategis.com/p_beavers-longestdam.htm |title=National Geographic photos |publisher=Geostrategis.com |accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref> It is located on the southern edge of [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in northern [[Alberta]] and is twice the width of the [[Hoover Dam]] which spans {{convert|1244|ft|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Beaver in Winter, Gatineau Park.jpg|thumb|left|''C. c. canadensis'', feeding in winter]]\nNormally, the purpose of the dam is to provide water around their lodges that is deep enough that it does not freeze solid in winter. The dams also flood areas of surrounding forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees. In colder climates where their pond freezes over, beavers also build a food cache from this food resource<ref name=\":0\" /> To form the cache, beavers collect food in late fall in the form of tree branches, storing them under water (usually by sticking the sharp chewed base of the branches into the mud on the pond bottom), where they can be accessed through the winter. Often, the pile of food branches projects above the pond and collects snow. This insulates the water below it and keeps the pond open at that location.<ref name=\":4\" /> The frozen combination of branches and ice is known as a cap, sealing the food cache. Beavers often maintain an underwater entrance to their dam, and they can access their food cache from their lodge by swimming under the ice. In warmer climes, a winter food store is less common.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Muskrat]]s have been thought to steal food from beaver lodges, but seemingly cooperative relationships exist, with beavers allowing muskrats to reside in their lodge if they gather fresh reeds.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beaver Lodge Construction Squad {{!}} Attenborough {{!}} BBC Earth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyNA62FrKCE|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Canals ===\nAnother component to the beaver's habitat is the canal. Canals are used to float logs to a pond, and dams may also be used to maintain the water levels in these canals. Several land trails can extend from the canals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://neurosciencelibrary.org/specimens/rodentia/beaver/index.html|title=Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections: North American beaver (Castor canadensis)|website=neurosciencelibrary.org|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Despite being widespread in some beaver-inhabited areas, beaver canals and their environmental effects are much less studied than beaver dams.

A 2012 study of beavers' mark on the landscape found that cut stumps were negatively related to distance from beaver canals, but not to the central body of water. This finding suggested that beavers may consider the canals to be part of their \"central place\" as far as foraging activity is concerned.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Matthew|last2=Fultz|first2=Brandon|last3=Wilson|first3=Jon|last4=Nicholson|first4=Jody|last5=Black|first5=Matt|last6=Thomas|first6=Adam|last7=Kot|first7=Amanda|last8=Burrows|first8=Mallory|last9=Schaffer|first9=Benton|last10=Benson|first10=David|date=2012-01-01|title=Beaver-Dredged Canals and their Spacial Relationship to Beaver-Cut Stumps|url=https://mushare.marian.edu/fp_db/4|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science (Vol.121, No.2)}}</ref> \n\n=== Social behavior ===\nCommunication is highly developed in beaver, including scent marking, vocalization, and tail slapping. Beaver deposit castoreum on piles of debris and mud called scent mounds, which are usually placed on or near lodges, dams, and trails less than a meter from water. Over 100 of such mounds can be constructed within one territory.<ref name=\":0\" /> Beaver colonies with close neighbors constructed more \u201cscent mounds\u201d than did isolated colonies, and the number of scent mounds at each active lodge is correlated with the distance to the nearest occupied lodge.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=M\u00fcller-Schwarze|first=D.|last2=Heckman|first2=Susan|date=1980-01-01|title=The social role of scent marking in beaver (Castor Canadensis)|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=81\u201395|doi=10.1007/BF00987529|issn=1573-1561}}</ref>\n\nAlthough seven vocal sounds have been described for beaver, most [[Zoology|zoologists]] recognize only three: a whine, hiss, and growl. Vocalizations and tail slapping may be used to beg for food, signal to family members to warn of predators, or to drive away or elicit a response from predators.\n\nBeavers usually mate for life, forming familial colonies. Beaver \"kits\" are born precocious and with a developed coat. The young beaver \"kits\" typically remain with their parents up to two years. Kits express some adult behaviors, but require a long period in the family to develop their dam construction skills, and other abilities required for independent life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Diet ===\nBeaver are herbivorous [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists]] with sophisticated [[foraging]] preferences. Beavers consume a mix of [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] and [[Woody plant|woody plants]], which varies considerably in both composition and species diversity by region and season.<ref name=\":0\" /> They prefer [[aspen]] and [[Populus|poplar]], but also take [[birch]], [[maple]], [[willow]], [[alder]], [[Prunus serotina|black cherry]], [[Quercus rubra|red oak]], [[beech]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hornbeam]], and occasionally [[pine]] and [[spruce]].<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqIenKko3lAC|title=The Beaver: Natural History of a Wetlands Engineer|author1=M\u00fcller-Schwarze, Dietland|author2=Sun, Lixing|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8014-4098-4|pages=67\u201375|lastauthoramp=yes}}</ref> They also eat [[cattails]], [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]], and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring (and contrary to widespread belief, they do not eat fish).<ref>Young, Mary Taylor (August 13, 2007). {{cite web|url=http://wildlife.state.co.us/Education/TeacherResources/ColoradoWildlifeCompany/CWCSum91Beavers.htm|title=Colorado Division of Wildlife: Do Beavers Eat Fish?|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910012112/http://wildlife.state.co.us/Education/TeacherResources/ColoradoWildlifeCompany/CWCSum91Beavers.htm|archivedate=September 10, 2010|accessdate=2015-05-18|df=mdy-all}} wildlife.state.co.us</ref>\n\nBeavers select food based on taste, coarse physical shape, and odor.

In the winter, beavers switch to woody plants and the food they have stored over the winter. The protein to calorie ratio of a beaver's diet is 40 mg/calorie in summer and 8 mg/calorie for the rest of the year. In northern latitudes, the water lilies [[Nymphaea]] and [[Nuphar]] are the most important herbaceous component. The [[Rhizome|rhizomes]] are stored in the food cache and remain actively growing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWillow is an important protein source and is likely to be available for the longest period of time in a beaver's habitat especially in the far north. When available, aspen and poplar are preferred over willow. [[Pinophyta|Conifers]] are also cut or gnawed by beavers, and used for food and/or building material.\n\nBeavers do not necessarily use the same trees as construction material and as food. Inedible material is more likely to be used as the cap of a beaver family's food cache, the upper part which is frozen in the ice, while the cache itself is composed of edible, high quality branches, which remain unfrozen and accessible.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBeavers avoid [[Acer rubrum|red maple]], which can be the only tree left standing at the edges of some beaver ponds.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=M\u00fcller-Schwarze|first=D.|last2=Schulte|first2=B.

Such an analysis would be complicated by the fact that substantial genetic mixing of populations has occurred because of the numerous reintroduction efforts intended to help the species recover following extirpation from many regions.\n\nThe most widespread (formerly recognized) subspecies, which perhaps are now best thought of as populations with some distinct physical characteristics, are ''C. c. acadicus'' (New England beaver), ''C. c. canadensis'' (Canadian beaver), ''C. c. carolinensis'' (Carolina beaver), and ''C. c. missouriensis'' (Missouri River beaver).<ref name=\"baker\">Baker, B.

North American beavers tend to be slightly smaller, with smaller, more rounded heads; shorter, wider muzzles; thicker, longer, and darker underfur; wider, more oval-shaped tails; and longer shin bones, allowing them a greater range of bipedal locomotion than the European species. North American beavers have shorter nasal bones than their European relatives, with the widest point being at the middle of the snout for the former, and in the tip for the latter. The nasal opening for the North American species is square, unlike that of the European race, which is triangular. The [[foramen magnum]] is triangular in the North American beaver, and rounded in the European. The [[anal gland]]s of the North American beaver are smaller and thick-walled with a small internal volume compared to that of the European species. Finally, the guard hairs of the North American beaver have a shorter hollow medulla at their tips. Fur color is also different. Overall, 50% of North American beavers have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish, while in European beavers, 66% have pale brown or beige fur, 20% are reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats.<ref name=\"andy\">{{cite book | author= Kitchener, Andrew | title=Beavers | year=2001 | isbn= 978-1-873580-55-4 | page= 144 }}</ref>\n\nThe two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 [[chromosomes]], while European beavers have 48. Also, more than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in one stillborn kit.

During the roughly 30 years (1806\u20131838) of the era of the [[mountain man]], the West from Missouri to California and from Canada to Mexico was thoroughly explored and the beaver was brought to the brink of extinction.\n\nWith protection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the current beaver population has rebounded to an estimated 10 to 15 million; this is a fraction of the originally estimated 100 to 200 million North American beavers before the days of the [[fur trade]].<ref>Seton-Thompson, cited in {{cite book |last =Sun |first =Lixing |author2=M\u00fcller-Schwarze, Dietland  |title =The Beaver: Natural History of a Wetlands Engineer |publisher =Cornell University Press |year =2003 |location=Ithaca, NY |pages=97\u201398 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=eqIenKko3lAC|isbn = 978-0-8014-4098-4}}; but note that to arrive at this figure he assumed a population density throughout the range equivalent to that in [[Algonquin Park]]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Water:A Natural History |author=Outwater, Alice |publisher=Basic Books |year=1997 |location=New York, NY |page=89 |isbn=978-0-465-03780-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3_oRrNgE_mkC}}</ref>\n[[File:Beavers Ain't Chopping That Tree Down (4340897705).jpg|thumb|upright|A wire mesh fence installed around a tree trunk in [[Toronto]].

Beavers returned to the area in 1954 after a long absence since their extirpation by the fur trade in the 19th century. During drought years, where beavers were present, 60% more open water was available than those same areas during previous drought periods when beavers were absent.

It has a large, flat, paddle-shaped tail and large, webbed hind feet. The unwebbed front paws are smaller, with claws.

The fur has a range of colors, but usually is dark brown. [[Scent gland]]s near the genitals secrete an oily substance known as [[castoreum]], which the beaver uses to waterproof its fur. There is also another set of oil glands producing unique chemical identifiers in the form of waxy esters and fatty acids.<ref name=\":0\" /> The lush, workable fur was made into a number of products, most notably [[beaver hat|hats]]. Demand for furs for hats drove beavers nearly to the point of extinction, and the North American species was saved principally by a sudden change in style.

Beavers are well known for building [[dam]]s across streams and constructing their lodges in the artificial ponds which form. When building in a pond, the beavers first make a pile of sticks and then eat out one or more underwater entrances and two platforms above the water surface inside the pile. The first is used for drying off. Towards winter, the lodge is often plastered with mud which, when it freezes, has the consistency of concrete. A small air hole is left in the top of the lodge.\n\n=== Dam-building ===\nThe purpose of the [[Beaver dam|dam]] is to create deepwater refugia enabling the beaver to escape from predators. When deep water is already present in lakes, rivers, or larger streams, the beaver may dwell in a bank burrow and bank lodge with an underwater entrance. The beaver dam is constructed using branches from trees the beavers cut down, as well as rocks, grass, and mud. The inner bark, twigs, shoots, and leaves of such trees are also an important part of the beaver's diet.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An extensive study of the foraging ecology of beavers (''Castor canadensis'') in relation to habitat quality |author1=Gallant, D. |author2=B\u00e9rub\u00e9, C.H. |author3=Tremblay, E. |author4=Vasseur, L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004 |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |url=http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/courses/BI312/upload/ForagingBeaversHabitatQuality.pdf |volume=82|pages=922\u2013933 |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |doi=10.1139/z04-067 |issue=6 }}</ref> The trees are cut down using their strong [[incisor]] teeth. Their front paws are used for digging and carrying and placing materials. The sound of running water dictates when and where a beaver builds its dam. Besides providing a safe home for the beaver, beaver ponds also provide habitat for [[waterfowl]], [[fish]], and other aquatic animals. Their dams help reduce soil [[erosion]] and can help reduce flooding. However, beaver dams are not permanent and depend on the beavers' continued presence for their maintenance. Beavers generally concentrate on building and repairing dams in the fall in preparation for the coming winter. In northern areas, they often do not repair breaches in the dam made by otters, and sometimes breach the dam themselves and lower the water level in the pond to create more breathing space under the ice or get easier access to trees below the dam. In a 1988 study in Alberta, Canada, no beavers repaired \"sites of water loss\" during the winter. Of 178 sites of water loss, beavers repaired 78 when water was opened, and did not repair 68. The rest were partially repaired.<ref>Donald G. Reid, Stephen M. Herrero and Thomas E. Code, \"River Otters as Agents of Water Loss from Beaver Ponds,\" Journal of Mammalogy, February 1988.</ref>\n\nBeavers are best known for their dam-building. They maintain their pond-habitat by reacting quickly to the sound of running water, and damming it up with tree branches and mud. Early ecologists believed that this dam-building was an amazing feat of architectural planning, indicative of the beaver's high intellect. This theory was tested when a recording of running water was played in a field near a beaver pond. Although it was on dry land, the beaver covered the tape player with branches and mud.<ref name = Richard>{{cite journal | author = Richard P.B. | year = 1983 | title = Mechanisms and adaptation in the constructive behavior of the beaver (C. fiber L.) | journal = Acta Zoologica Fennica | volume = 174 | pages = 105\u2013108 }}</ref> The largest beaver dam is {{convert|2790|ft|abbr=on}} in length\u2014more than half a mile long\u2014and was discovered via satellite imagery in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thie, Jean  |url=http://www.geostrategis.com/p_beavers-longestdam.htm |title=National Geographic photos |publisher=Geostrategis.com |accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref> It is located on the southern edge of [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in northern [[Alberta]] and is twice the width of the [[Hoover Dam]] which spans {{convert|1244|ft|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Beaver in Winter, Gatineau Park.jpg|thumb|left|''C. c. canadensis'', feeding in winter]]\nNormally, the purpose of the dam is to provide water around their lodges that is deep enough that it does not freeze solid in winter. The dams also flood areas of surrounding forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees. In colder climates where their pond freezes over, beavers also build a food cache from this food resource<ref name=\":0\" /> To form the cache, beavers collect food in late fall in the form of tree branches, storing them under water (usually by sticking the sharp chewed base of the branches into the mud on the pond bottom), where they can be accessed through the winter. Often, the pile of food branches projects above the pond and collects snow. This insulates the water below it and keeps the pond open at that location.<ref name=\":4\" /> The frozen combination of branches and ice is known as a cap, sealing the food cache. Beavers often maintain an underwater entrance to their dam, and they can access their food cache from their lodge by swimming under the ice. In warmer climes, a winter food store is less common.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Muskrat]]s have been thought to steal food from beaver lodges, but seemingly cooperative relationships exist, with beavers allowing muskrats to reside in their lodge if they gather fresh reeds.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beaver Lodge Construction Squad {{!}} Attenborough {{!}} BBC Earth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyNA62FrKCE|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Canals ===\nAnother component to the beaver's habitat is the canal. Canals are used to float logs to a pond, and dams may also be used to maintain the water levels in these canals. Several land trails can extend from the canals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://neurosciencelibrary.org/specimens/rodentia/beaver/index.html|title=Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections: North American beaver (Castor canadensis)|website=neurosciencelibrary.org|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Despite being widespread in some beaver-inhabited areas, beaver canals and their environmental effects are much less studied than beaver dams.

A 2012 study of beavers' mark on the landscape found that cut stumps were negatively related to distance from beaver canals, but not to the central body of water. This finding suggested that beavers may consider the canals to be part of their \"central place\" as far as foraging activity is concerned.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Matthew|last2=Fultz|first2=Brandon|last3=Wilson|first3=Jon|last4=Nicholson|first4=Jody|last5=Black|first5=Matt|last6=Thomas|first6=Adam|last7=Kot|first7=Amanda|last8=Burrows|first8=Mallory|last9=Schaffer|first9=Benton|last10=Benson|first10=David|date=2012-01-01|title=Beaver-Dredged Canals and their Spacial Relationship to Beaver-Cut Stumps|url=https://mushare.marian.edu/fp_db/4|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science (Vol.121, No.2)}}</ref> \n\n=== Social behavior ===\nCommunication is highly developed in beaver, including scent marking, vocalization, and tail slapping. Beaver deposit castoreum on piles of debris and mud called scent mounds, which are usually placed on or near lodges, dams, and trails less than a meter from water. Over 100 of such mounds can be constructed within one territory.<ref name=\":0\" /> Beaver colonies with close neighbors constructed more \u201cscent mounds\u201d than did isolated colonies, and the number of scent mounds at each active lodge is correlated with the distance to the nearest occupied lodge.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=M\u00fcller-Schwarze|first=D.|last2=Heckman|first2=Susan|date=1980-01-01|title=The social role of scent marking in beaver (Castor Canadensis)|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=81\u201395|doi=10.1007/BF00987529|issn=1573-1561}}</ref>\n\nAlthough seven vocal sounds have been described for beaver, most [[Zoology|zoologists]] recognize only three: a whine, hiss, and growl. Vocalizations and tail slapping may be used to beg for food, signal to family members to warn of predators, or to drive away or elicit a response from predators.\n\nBeavers usually mate for life, forming familial colonies. Beaver \"kits\" are born precocious and with a developed coat. The young beaver \"kits\" typically remain with their parents up to two years. Kits express some adult behaviors, but require a long period in the family to develop their dam construction skills, and other abilities required for independent life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Diet ===\nBeaver are herbivorous [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists]] with sophisticated [[foraging]] preferences. Beavers consume a mix of [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] and [[Woody plant|woody plants]], which varies considerably in both composition and species diversity by region and season.<ref name=\":0\" /> They prefer [[aspen]] and [[Populus|poplar]], but also take [[birch]], [[maple]], [[willow]], [[alder]], [[Prunus serotina|black cherry]], [[Quercus rubra|red oak]], [[beech]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hornbeam]], and occasionally [[pine]] and [[spruce]].<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqIenKko3lAC|title=The Beaver: Natural History of a Wetlands Engineer|author1=M\u00fcller-Schwarze, Dietland|author2=Sun, Lixing|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8014-4098-4|pages=67\u201375|lastauthoramp=yes}}</ref> They also eat [[cattails]], [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]], and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring (and contrary to widespread belief, they do not eat fish).<ref>Young, Mary Taylor (August 13, 2007). {{cite web|url=http://wildlife.state.co.us/Education/TeacherResources/ColoradoWildlifeCompany/CWCSum91Beavers.htm|title=Colorado Division of Wildlife: Do Beavers Eat Fish?|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910012112/http://wildlife.state.co.us/Education/TeacherResources/ColoradoWildlifeCompany/CWCSum91Beavers.htm|archivedate=September 10, 2010|accessdate=2015-05-18|df=mdy-all}} wildlife.state.co.us</ref>\n\nBeavers select food based on taste, coarse physical shape, and odor.

In the winter, beavers switch to woody plants and the food they have stored over the winter. The protein to calorie ratio of a beaver's diet is 40 mg/calorie in summer and 8 mg/calorie for the rest of the year. In northern latitudes, the water lilies [[Nymphaea]] and [[Nuphar]] are the most important herbaceous component. The [[Rhizome|rhizomes]] are stored in the food cache and remain actively growing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWillow is an important protein source and is likely to be available for the longest period of time in a beaver's habitat especially in the far north. When available, aspen and poplar are preferred over willow. [[Pinophyta|Conifers]] are also cut or gnawed by beavers, and used for food and/or building material.\n\nBeavers do not necessarily use the same trees as construction material and as food. Inedible material is more likely to be used as the cap of a beaver family's food cache, the upper part which is frozen in the ice, while the cache itself is composed of edible, high quality branches, which remain unfrozen and accessible.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBeavers avoid [[Acer rubrum|red maple]], which can be the only tree left standing at the edges of some beaver ponds.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=M\u00fcller-Schwarze|first=D.|last2=Schulte|first2=B.

The Carolina beaver is found in the southeastern United States; the Missouri River beaver, as its name suggests, is found in the [[Missouri River]] and its tributaries; and ''C. c. acadicus'' is found throughout the [[New England]] area in the northeastern United States.\n\n==Differences from European beaver==\n[[File:Castor fiber vs. Castor canadensis skulls.jpg|left|thumb|Skulls of a European and Canadian beaver.]]\n\nAlthough North American beavers are superficially similar to the [[European beaver]] (''Castor fiber''), several important differences exist between the two species. North American beavers tend to be slightly smaller, with smaller, more rounded heads; shorter, wider muzzles; thicker, longer, and darker underfur; wider, more oval-shaped tails; and longer shin bones, allowing them a greater range of bipedal locomotion than the European species. North American beavers have shorter nasal bones than their European relatives, with the widest point being at the middle of the snout for the former, and in the tip for the latter. The nasal opening for the North American species is square, unlike that of the European race, which is triangular. The [[foramen magnum]] is triangular in the North American beaver, and rounded in the European. The [[anal gland]]s of the North American beaver are smaller and thick-walled with a small internal volume compared to that of the European species. Finally, the guard hairs of the North American beaver have a shorter hollow medulla at their tips. Fur color is also different. Overall, 50% of North American beavers have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish, while in European beavers, 66% have pale brown or beige fur, 20% are reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats.<ref name=\"andy\">{{cite book | author= Kitchener, Andrew | title=Beavers | year=2001 | isbn= 978-1-873580-55-4 | page= 144 }}</ref>\n\nThe two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 [[chromosomes]], while European beavers have 48. Also, more than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in one stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.<ref name=\"andy\" />\n\n==Ecology==\nThe beaver was trapped out and almost extirpated in North America because its fur and [[castoreum]] were highly sought after.<ref name=Naiman /> The beaver furs were used to make clothing and [[beaver hat]]s.

This nonforest habitat attracted both [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and early colonial hunters to the abundant fish, waterfowl, and large game attracted to the riparian clearings created by these aquatic mammals. The first colonial farmers were also attracted to the fertile, flat bottomlands created by the accumulated silt and organic matter in beaver ponds.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0003598X00055265| title= ''Home sapiens'' or ''Castor fiber''? |author=Coles, J.

Much of the westward expansion and exploration of North America was driven by the quest for this animal's fur. Before the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]], an earlier, 19th-century [[California Fur Rush]] drove the earliest American settlement in that state. During the roughly 30 years (1806\u20131838) of the era of the [[mountain man]], the West from Missouri to California and from Canada to Mexico was thoroughly explored and the beaver was brought to the brink of extinction.\n\nWith protection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the current beaver population has rebounded to an estimated 10 to 15 million; this is a fraction of the originally estimated 100 to 200 million North American beavers before the days of the [[fur trade]].<ref>Seton-Thompson, cited in {{cite book |last =Sun |first =Lixing |author2=M\u00fcller-Schwarze, Dietland  |title =The Beaver: Natural History of a Wetlands Engineer |publisher =Cornell University Press |year =2003 |location=Ithaca, NY |pages=97\u201398 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=eqIenKko3lAC|isbn = 978-0-8014-4098-4}}; but note that to arrive at this figure he assumed a population density throughout the range equivalent to that in [[Algonquin Park]]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Water:A Natural History |author=Outwater, Alice |publisher=Basic Books |year=1997 |location=New York, NY |page=89 |isbn=978-0-465-03780-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3_oRrNgE_mkC}}</ref>\n[[File:Beavers Ain't Chopping That Tree Down (4340897705).jpg|thumb|upright|A wire mesh fence installed around a tree trunk in [[Toronto]].

Beavers returned to the area in 1954 after a long absence since their extirpation by the fur trade in the 19th century.
