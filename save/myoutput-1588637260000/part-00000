The aortic and mitral valves are shown in the left heart, and the tricuspid and pulmonic valves are shown in the right heart.]]\n\n'''Valvular heart disease''' is any [[cardiovascular disease]] process involving one or more of the four [[Heart valve|valves of the heart]] (the [[aortic valve|aortic]] and [[mitral valve]]s on the left side of heart and the [[pulmonary valve|pulmonic]] and [[tricuspid valves]] on the right side of heart). These conditions occur largely as a consequence of aging,<ref name=\":1\">Burden of valvular heart diseases: a population-based study.

Kovacs AH, Harrison JL, Colman JM, Sermer M, Siu SC, Silversides CK J Am Coll Cardiol. 2008;52(7):577.</ref>\n\nAnatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue of the heart known as the [[cardiac skeleton]] and are responsible for the regulation of blood flow through the heart and [[great vessels]]. Valve failure or dysfunction can result in diminished heart functionality, though the particular consequences are dependent on the type and severity of valvular disease. Treatment of damaged valves may involve medication alone, but often involves surgical [[valve repair]] (valvuloplasty) or [[valve replacement|replacement]] (insertion of an [[artificial heart valve]]).\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Phonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png|thumb]]\n\nStenosis and insufficiency/regurgitation represent the dominant functional and anatomic consequences associated with valvular heart disease. Irrespective of disease process, alterations to the valve occur that produce one or a combination of these conditions. Insufficiency and regurgitation are synonymous terms that describe an inability of the valve to prevent backflow of blood as leaflets of the valve fail to join (coapt) correctly. Stenosis is characterized by a narrowing of the valvular orifice that prevents adequate outflow of blood. Stenosis can also result in insufficiency if thickening of the annulus or leaflets results in inappropriate leaf closure.  \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ''Valve involved''\n| ''Stenotic disease''\n| ''Insufficiency/regurgitation disease''\n|-\n| Aortic valve\n| [[Aortic valve stenosis]]\n| [[Aortic insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|-\n| Mitral valve\n| [[Mitral valve stenosis]]\n| [[Mitral insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|-\n| Tricuspid valve\n| [[Tricuspid valve stenosis]]\n| [[Tricuspid insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|-\n| Pulmonary valve\n| [[Pulmonary valve stenosis]]\n| [[Pulmonary insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|}\n\n===Aortic and mitral valve disorders===\nAortic and mitral valve disease are termed [[left heart]] diseases. Diseases of these valves are more prevalent than disease of the pulmonary or tricuspid valve due to the higher pressures the left heart experiences.<ref name=\"practicalcardiology\" />\n\nStenosis of the aortic valve is characterized by a thickening of the valvular annulus or leaflets that limits the ability of blood to be ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta. Stenosis is typically the result of valvular calcification but may be the result of a congenitally malformed [[bicuspid aortic valve]]. This defect is characterized by the presence of only two valve leaflets. It may occur in isolation or in concert with other cardiac anomalies.\n\nAortic insufficiency, or regurgitation, is characterized by an inability of the valve leaflets to appropriately close at end [[systole]], thus allowing blood to flow inappropriately backwards into the left ventricle. Causes of aortic insufficiency in the majority of cases are unknown, or [[Idiopathy|idiopathic]].<ref>Chapter 1: Diseases of the Cardiovascular system > Section: Valvular Heart Disease in: Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S.

Processes that lead to aortic insufficiency usually involve [[Aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva|dilation of the valve annulus]], thus displacing the valve leaflets, which are anchored in the annulus.\n\nMitral stenosis is caused largely by [[Rheumatic fever|rheumatic heart disease]], though is rarely the result of calcification. In some cases vegetations form on the mitral leaflets as a result of endocarditis, an inflammation of the heart tissue. Mitral stenosis is uncommon and not as age-dependent as other types of valvular disease.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMitral insufficiency can be caused by dilation of the left heart, often a consequence of [[heart failure]]. In these cases the left ventricle of the heart becomes enlarged and causes displacement of the attached [[papillary muscle]]s, which control the mitral valve.\n\n===Pulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders===\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve diseases are [[right heart]] diseases. Pulmonary valve diseases are the least common heart valve disease in adults.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=practicalcardiology>Ragavendra R. Baliga, Kim A.

Unless the degree of stenosis is severe individuals with pulmonary stenosis usually have excellent outcomes and treatment options. Often patients do not require intervention until later in adulthood as a consequence of calcification that occurs with aging.\n\nPulmonary valve insufficiency occurs commonly in healthy individuals to a very mild extent and does not require intervention.<ref name=\":2\">2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.

The aortic and mitral valves are shown in the left heart, and the tricuspid and pulmonic valves are shown in the right heart.]]\n\n'''Valvular heart disease''' is any [[cardiovascular disease]] process involving one or more of the four [[Heart valve|valves of the heart]] (the [[aortic valve|aortic]] and [[mitral valve]]s on the left side of heart and the [[pulmonary valve|pulmonic]] and [[tricuspid valves]] on the right side of heart). These conditions occur largely as a consequence of aging,<ref name=\":1\">Burden of valvular heart diseases: a population-based study.

Kovacs AH, Harrison JL, Colman JM, Sermer M, Siu SC, Silversides CK J Am Coll Cardiol. 2008;52(7):577.</ref>\n\nAnatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue of the heart known as the [[cardiac skeleton]] and are responsible for the regulation of blood flow through the heart and [[great vessels]]. Valve failure or dysfunction can result in diminished heart functionality, though the particular consequences are dependent on the type and severity of valvular disease. Treatment of damaged valves may involve medication alone, but often involves surgical [[valve repair]] (valvuloplasty) or [[valve replacement|replacement]] (insertion of an [[artificial heart valve]]).\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Phonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.png|thumb]]\n\nStenosis and insufficiency/regurgitation represent the dominant functional and anatomic consequences associated with valvular heart disease. Irrespective of disease process, alterations to the valve occur that produce one or a combination of these conditions. Insufficiency and regurgitation are synonymous terms that describe an inability of the valve to prevent backflow of blood as leaflets of the valve fail to join (coapt) correctly. Stenosis is characterized by a narrowing of the valvular orifice that prevents adequate outflow of blood. Stenosis can also result in insufficiency if thickening of the annulus or leaflets results in inappropriate leaf closure.  \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ''Valve involved''\n| ''Stenotic disease''\n| ''Insufficiency/regurgitation disease''\n|-\n| Aortic valve\n| [[Aortic valve stenosis]]\n| [[Aortic insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|-\n| Mitral valve\n| [[Mitral valve stenosis]]\n| [[Mitral insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|-\n| Tricuspid valve\n| [[Tricuspid valve stenosis]]\n| [[Tricuspid insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|-\n| Pulmonary valve\n| [[Pulmonary valve stenosis]]\n| [[Pulmonary insufficiency]]/regurgitation\n|}\n\n===Aortic and mitral valve disorders===\nAortic and mitral valve disease are termed [[left heart]] diseases. Diseases of these valves are more prevalent than disease of the pulmonary or tricuspid valve due to the higher pressures the left heart experiences.<ref name=\"practicalcardiology\" />\n\nStenosis of the aortic valve is characterized by a thickening of the valvular annulus or leaflets that limits the ability of blood to be ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta. Stenosis is typically the result of valvular calcification but may be the result of a congenitally malformed [[bicuspid aortic valve]]. This defect is characterized by the presence of only two valve leaflets. It may occur in isolation or in concert with other cardiac anomalies.\n\nAortic insufficiency, or regurgitation, is characterized by an inability of the valve leaflets to appropriately close at end [[systole]], thus allowing blood to flow inappropriately backwards into the left ventricle. Causes of aortic insufficiency in the majority of cases are unknown, or [[Idiopathy|idiopathic]].<ref>Chapter 1: Diseases of the Cardiovascular system > Section: Valvular Heart Disease in: Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S.

Processes that lead to aortic insufficiency usually involve [[Aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva|dilation of the valve annulus]], thus displacing the valve leaflets, which are anchored in the annulus.\n\nMitral stenosis is caused largely by [[Rheumatic fever|rheumatic heart disease]], though is rarely the result of calcification. In some cases vegetations form on the mitral leaflets as a result of endocarditis, an inflammation of the heart tissue. Mitral stenosis is uncommon and not as age-dependent as other types of valvular disease.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMitral insufficiency can be caused by dilation of the left heart, often a consequence of [[heart failure]]. In these cases the left ventricle of the heart becomes enlarged and causes displacement of the attached [[papillary muscle]]s, which control the mitral valve.\n\n===Pulmonary and tricuspid valve disorders===\nPulmonary and tricuspid valve diseases are [[right heart]] diseases. Pulmonary valve diseases are the least common heart valve disease in adults.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=practicalcardiology>Ragavendra R. Baliga, Kim A. Eagle, William F Armstrong, David S Bach, Eric R Bates, ''Practical Cardiology'', Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2008, page 452.</ref>\n\nPulmonary valve stenosis is often the result of congenital malformations and is observed in isolation or as part of a larger pathologic process, as in [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], [[Noonan syndrome]], and [[congenital rubella syndrome]] . Unless the degree of stenosis is severe individuals with pulmonary stenosis usually have excellent outcomes and treatment options. Often patients do not require intervention until later in adulthood as a consequence of calcification that occurs with aging.\n\nPulmonary valve insufficiency occurs commonly in healthy individuals to a very mild extent and does not require intervention.<ref name=\":2\">2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.
