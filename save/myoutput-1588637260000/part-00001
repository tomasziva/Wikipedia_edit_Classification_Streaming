For passholders, there is no additional charge for the first 30 minutes of each trip. Alternately, members get a full 60 minutes between stations with no additional charge. However, trip fees can rack up quickly\u2014particularly after 90 minutes without redocking the bike\u2014reaching up to a daily limit of $65 after 7 hours of use (in addition to any pass or membership fee).<ref name=\"how-it-works\"/>  This fee structure is designed to encourage short trips, keep bikes available, and push customers desiring multi-hour trips to use for-profit rental businesses rather than the subsidized bike-share service.  Only about 2% of trips incur any fees.\n\nIn the 2010 and 2011 seasons, Nice Ride placed an [[authorization hold]] on the credit or debit accounts of 24-hour subscribers per bicycle rented (24-hour subscribers can rent two bikes per credit/debit card at a time).<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719231854/https://www.niceridemn.org/subscriptions/|title=Subscriptions|archivedate=July 19, 2011|publisher=Nice Ride MN|accessdate=April 3, 2012|url=https://www.niceridemn.org/subscriptions/}}</ref>  The holds were initially set at $250 when system was launched in 2010, which caused problems for some customers\u2014particularly those who had used debit cards, where it was possible cause an account [[overdraft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/lifestyle/97587759.html|title=A glitch in the system: Minneapolis bike share creating cash flow problems|author=Tom Held|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=July 1, 2010|accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref> Prior to the system's launch, there was a concern that a large percentage of the bicycles would be stolen\u2014especially in light of the [[V\u00e9lib']] system in [[Paris]], [[France]], which had a theft rate of more than 50% in its first 18 months,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7881079.stm|title=Thefts puncture Paris bike scheme|work=BBC News|date=February 10, 2009|accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref> and previous experience with theft and vandalism of free bikes provided by the Yellow Bike Coalition in Saint Paul a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5DF7D0B68EC12&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Yellow Bike Program Keeps Pedaling Away|date=September 16, 1995|accessdate=April 4, 2012|work=St. Paul Pioneer Press|page=1B}}</ref>  However, those worries proved to be unfounded with the new Bixi-based system\u2014only one bike was counted as stolen in the 2010 season, and no bikes were lost or stolen in 2011.
