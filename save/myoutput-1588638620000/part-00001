The angle of the incident light (represented by both the light in the mirror and the shadow behind it) matches the exact angle of reflection (the reflected light shining on the table).]]\n\nA '''mirror''' or '''reflector''' is an object such that each narrow beam of [[light]] that incides on its surface bounces (is [[reflection (physics)|reflected]]) in a single direction. This property, called [[specular reflection]], distinguishes a mirror from objects that scatter light in many directions (such as flat-white paint), let it pass through them (such as a [[lens]] or [[prism (optics)|prism]]), or absorb it.\n\nMost mirrors behave as such only for certain ranges of wavelength, direction, and polarization of the incident light; most commonly for [[visible light]], but also for other regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from [[X-rays]] to [[radio wave]]s. A mirror will generally reflect only a fraction of the incident light; even the best mirrors may scatter, absorb, or transmit a small portion of it.  If the mirror's width is only a few times the [[wavelength]] of the light, a significant part of the light will also be [[diffraction|diffracted]] instead.  An object that is a mirror when examined at a small scale (like a [[ball bearing|bearing ball]]) may seem to be scattering light when examined at a larger scale.  \n\nWhen looking at a mirror, one will see a [[mirror image]] or reflected image of objects in the environment, formed by light emitted or scattered by them and reflected by the mirror towards one's eyes.  This effect gives the illusion that those objects are behind the mirror, or (sometimes) [[real image|in front of it]].  A [[plane mirror]] will yield a real-looking undistorted image, while a [[curved mirror]] may distort, magnify, or reduce the image in various ways.\n\nA mirror is commonly used for inspecting oneself, such as during [[personal grooming]]; hence the old-fashioned name '''looking glass'''.<ref name=camboldf/>   This use, which dates from the Prehistory,<ref name=pend2004/> overlaps with uses in [[decoration]] and [[architecture]]. Mirrors are also used to view other items that are not directly visible because of obstructions; examples include [[rear-view mirror]]s in vehicles, [[curved_mirror#Uses_of_convex_mirrors|security mirror]]s in or around buildings, and [[mouth mirror|dentist's mirror]]s.  Mirrors are also used in optical and scientific apparatus such as [[telescope]]s, [[laser]]s, [[camera]]s, [[periscope]]s, and industrial machinery.\n\nThe terms \"mirror\" and \"reflector\" can be used for devices that reflect other types of [[radiation]] according to the same laws.  An '''[[acoustic mirror]]''' reflects sound waves, and may be used for applications such as [[directional microphone]]s, [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies, [[sonar]], and [[sea floor mapping]].<ref name=U1/>  An '''[[atomic mirror]]''' reflects [[matter waves]], and can be used for atomic [[interferometry]] and atomic [[holography]].\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Egypt, New Kingdom, Dynasty 18 - Caryatid Mirror - 1983.196 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif\n| width1 = 152\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = NAMA Femme au miroir.jpg\n| width2 = 210\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' Bronze mirror, [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]], 1540\u20131296 BC, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (USA)<br>'''Right:''' seated woman holding a mirror; [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[lekythos]] by the [[Sabouroff Painter]], c. 470\u2013460 BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] (Greece)\n}}\n[[File:Naples National Archaeological Museum (14842094122).jpg|thumb|[[Roman art|Roman fresco]] of a woman fixing her hair using a mirror, from [[Stabiae]], Italy, 1st century AD]]\n[[File:Histoire de femme Gu Kai Zhi.jpg|thumb|'Adorning Oneself', detail from 'Admonitions of the Instructress to the Palace Ladies', [[Tang dynasty]] copy of an original by [[Chinese painting|Chinese painter]] [[Gu Kaizhi]], c. 344\u2013405 AD]]\n[[File:Lady looking into mirror Belur Halebidu.jpg|thumb|upright|A sculpture of a lady looking into a mirror, from [[Halebidu]], [[India]], 12th century]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe first mirrors used by humans were most likely pools of dark, still water, or water collected in a primitive vessel of some sort. The requirements for making a good mirror are a surface with a very high degree of [[Flatness (mathematics)|flatness]] (preferably but not necessarily with high [[reflectivity]]), and a [[surface roughness]] smaller than the wavelength of the light. \n\nThe earliest manufactured mirrors were pieces of polished stone such as [[obsidian]], a naturally occurring [[volcanic glass]].<ref name=fior2009/> Examples of obsidian mirrors found in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day Turkey) have been dated to around 6000&nbsp;BC.<ref name=enoch/> Mirrors of polished copper were crafted in [[Mesopotamia]] from 4000&nbsp;BC,<ref name=enoch/> and in ancient Egypt from around 3000&nbsp;BC.<ref name=stoc/> Polished stone mirrors from Central and South America date from around 2000&nbsp;BC onwards.<ref name=enoch/> \n\n===Bronze Age to Early Middle Age===\nBy the [[Bronze Age]] most cultures had adopted mirrors made from polished discs of [[bronze]], [[copper]] or other metals.<ref name=fior2009/> In China, [[bronze mirror]]s were manufactured from around 2000&nbsp;BC,<ref name=chvoc/> some of the earliest bronze and copper examples being produced by the [[Qijia culture]]. Mirrors made of other metal mixtures ([[alloy]]s) such as copper and tin [[speculum metal]] may have also been produced in China and India.<ref name=need1974/>  Such metal mirrors remained the norm through to [[Greco-Roman]] Antiquity and throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]].<ref name=brit2009/> Mirrors of speculum metal or any precious metal were hard to produce and were only owned by the wealthy.<ref name=hopk1910/> \n\nCommon metal mirrors tarnished and required frequently needed polishing. Bronze mirrors had low reflectivity and poor [[color rendering]], and stone mirrors were much worse in this regard.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.11}} These defects explain the [[New Testament]] reference in [[1 Corinthians 13]] to seeing \"as in a mirror, darkly.\"\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Socrates]], of \"[[know thyself]]\" fame, urged young people to look at themselves in mirrors so that, if they were beautiful, they would become worthy of their beauty, and if they were ugly, they would know how to hide their disgrace through learning.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.106}}\n\n[[Glass]] began to be used for mirrors in the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]], with the development of [[soda-lime glass]] and [[glass blowing]].<ref name=pulk1999/> The Roman scholar [[Pliny the Elder]] claims that artisans in [[Sidon]] (modern-day [[Lebanon]]) were producing glass mirrors coated with [[lead]] or [[gold leaf]] in the back.  The metal provided good reflectivity, and the glass provided a smooth surface and protected the metal from scrathes and tarnishing.<ref  name=plin0077/><ref name=holl2009/><ref name=ande2008/><ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.12}}<ref name=kels2007/>  However, there is no archeological evidence of glass mirrors before the third century.<ref name=degy/>  \n\nThese early glass mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small circular section from from 10 to 20 [[centimetre|cm]] in diameter.  Their surface was either concave or convex, and imperfections tended to distort the image.  Lead-coated mirrors were very thin to prevent cracking by the heat of the molten metal.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.10}}  Due to their poor quality, high cost, and small size, solid-metal mirrors, primarily of steel, remained in common use until the late nineteenth century.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.13}}\n\nSilver-coated metal mirrors were developed in China as early as 500 CE.  The bare metal was coated with an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], then heated it until the [[mercury]] boiled away.<ref name=rapp2009/>\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\nThe evolution of glass mirrors in the [[Middle Ages]] followed improvements in [[glassmaking]] technology.  Glassmakers in [[France]] made flat glass plates by blowing glass bubbles, spinning them rapidly to flatten them, and cutting rectangles out of them. A better method, developed in [[Germany]] and perfected in [[Veniice]]  by the 16th century, was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it along its length, and unroll it onto a flat hot plate.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.11}}  Venetian glassmakers also adopted [[lead glass]] for mirrors, because of its crystal-clarity and its easier workability.  By the 11th century, glass mirrors were being produced in [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Spain]].<ref name=Ajram/>\n\nDuring the early [[Renaissance]], the technique was developed in [[Europe]] of coating glass mirrors with a [[tin]]-mercury amalgam, producing an [[amorphous]] coating with better [[reflectivity]] than crystalline metals and causing little [[thermal shock]] to the glass.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.16}} Thedate and location of the discovery is unknown, but by the 16th century Venice was a center of mirror production using this technique. These Venetian mirrors were up to {{convert|40|in|cm}} square.\n\nGood glass mirrors from this period were still extremely expensive luxuries. For example, in the late seventeenth century, the Countess de Fiesque was reported to have traded an entire wheat farm for a mirror, considering it a bargain.<ref name=hads1993/>  \n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nThe invention of the [[ribbon machine]] in the late [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed modern glass panes to be produced in bulk.<ref name=bonn2011/> The [[Saint-Gobain]] factory, founded by royal initiative in France, was an important manufacturer, and [[Bohemia]]n and German glass, often rather cheaper, was also important.\n\nThe invention of the [[silvering|silvered-glass]] mirror is credited to German chemist [[Justus von Liebig]] in 1835.<ref name=lieb185/> His [[wet deposition]] process involved the deposition of a thin layer of metallic silver onto glass through the chemical reduction of [[silver nitrate]]. This [[silvering]] process was adapted for mass manufacturing and led to the greater availability of affordable mirrors.\n\n===Contemporary technologies===\nCurrently mirrors are often produced by the wet deposition of silver, or sometimes nickel or chromium (the latter used most often in automotive mirrors) via [[electroplating]] directly onto the glass substrate.<ref name=mlink2014/>\n\nGlass mirrors for optical instruments are usually produced by [[vacuum deposition]] methods. These techniques can be traced to observations in the 1920s and 1930s that metal was being ejected from [[electrode]]s in [[gas discharge lamp]]s and condensed on the glass walls forming a mirror-like coating.  The phenomenon, called [[sputtering]], was developed into an industrial metal-coating method with the development of [[semiconductor]] technology in the 1970s. \n\nA similar phenomenon had been observed with [[incandescent light bulbs]]: the metal in the hot filament would slowly [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] and condense on the bulb's walls.  This phenomenon was developed into the method of [[evaporation (deposition)|evaporation coating]] by Pohl and Pringsheim in 1912.   [[John D. Strong]] used evaporation coating to make the first [[aluminum]]-coated telescope mirrors in the 1930s.<ref name=matt2004/> The first [[dielectric mirror]] was created in 1937 by Auwarter using evaporated [[rhodium]].<ref name=ReferenceA/>\n\nThe metal coating of glass mirrors is usually protected from abrasion and corrosion by a layer of paint applied over it.  Mirrors for optical instruments often have the metal layer on the front face, so that the light does not have to cross the glass twice.  In these mirrors, the metal may be protected by a thin transparent coating of anon-metallic ([[dielectric]]) material.  The first metallic mirror to be enhanced with a dielectric coating of [[silicon dioxide]] was created by Hass in 1937. In 1939 at the [[Schott Glass]] company, Walter Geffcken invented the first dielectric mirrors to use multilayer coatings.<ref name=ReferenceA/>\n\n===Burning mirrors===\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] in [[Classical Antiquity]] were familar with the use of mirrors to concentrate light.  [[Parabolic mirror]]s were described and studied by the mathematician [[Diocles (mathematician)|Diocles]] in his work ''On Burning Mirrors''.<ref name=fried2001/> [[Ptolemy]] conducted a number of experiments with curved polished iron mirrors,<ref name=pend2004/>{{rp|p.64}} and discussed plane, convex spherical, and concave spherical mirrors in his ''Optics''.<ref name=mark1996/> \n\nParabolic mirrors were also described by the [[Caliphate]] mathematician [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] in the tenth century.<ref name=rash1990/>  The scholar [[Ibn al-Haytham]] discussed [[Curved mirror|concave and convex mirrors]] in both [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] and [[Spherical geometry|spherical geometries]],<ref name=elli1966/> carried out a number of experiments with mirrors, and solved the problem of finding the point on a convex mirror at which a ray coming from one point is reflected to another point.<ref name=Deek/>\n\n==Types of mirrors==\n[[File:Johann Jacob Kirstein 001.JPG|thumb|left|18th century [[vermeil]] mirror in the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts d\u00e9coratifs, Strasbourg]]]]\n\nMirrors can be classified in many ways; including by shape, support and reflective materials, manufaturing methods, and intended application.\n\n===By shape===\nTypical mirror shapes are [[plane mirror|planar]], [[curved mirror#Convex mirrors|convex]], and [[curved mirror#Concave mirrors|concave]].   \n\nThe surface of curved mirrors is often a part of a [[sphere]], for ease of fabrication.  Mirrors that are meant to precisely concentrate parallel rays of light into a point are usually made in the shape of a [[paraboloid of revolution]] instead; they are used in telescopes (form radio waves to X-rays), in antennas to communicate with [[broadcast satellite]]s, and in [[solar furnace]]s.  A [[segmented mirror]], consisting of multiple flat or curved mirrors, properly placed and oriented, may be used instead.\n\nMirrors that are intended to concentrate sunlight onto a long pipe may be a [[circular cylinder]] or of a [[parabolic cylinder]].{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n===By structural material===\n\n====Back-silvered mirrors====\nThe most common mirrors consist of a plate of transparent glass, with a thin reflective layer on the back (the side opposite to the incident and reflected light) backed by a coating that protects that layer against abrasion, tarnishing, and [[corrosion]].  The glass is usually soda-lime glass, but lead glass may be used for decorative effects, and other transparent materials may be used for specific applications.{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\nA plate of transparent [[plastic]] may be used instead of glass, for lighter weight or impact resistance. Alternatively, a flexible transparent plastic film may be bonded to the front and/or back surface of the mirror, to prevent injuries in case the mirror is broken.  Lettering or decorative designs may be printed on the front face of the glass, or formed on the reflective layer. The front surface may have an [[anti-reflection coating]].{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n====Front-silvered mirrors====\nMirrors which are reflective on the front surface (the same side of the incident and reflected light) may be made of any rigid material.  The supporting  material does not need to be transparent, but telescope mirrors often use glass anyway. Often a protective transparent coating is added on top of the reflecting layer, to protects it against abrasion, tarnishing, and corrosion, or to absorb certain wavelengths.{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n====Flexible mirrors====\nThin flexible plastic mirrors are sometimes used for safety, since they cannot shatter or produce sharp flakes. Their flatness is achieved by stretching them on a rigid frame.  These usually consist of a layer of evaporated aluminum between two thin layers of transparent plastic.{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n===By reflective material===\n\nIn common mirrors, the reflective layer is usually some metal like silver, [[nickel]], or [[chromium]], deposited by a wet process; or aluminum, deposited by sputtering or evaporation in vacuum. The reflective layer may also be made of one or more layers of transparent materials with suitable [[index of refraction|indices of refraction]].\n\nThe structural material may be a metal, in which case the reflecting layer may be just the surface of the same. Metal concave dishes are often used to reflect infrared light (such as in [[space heater]]s) or [[microwave]]s (as in satellite TV antennas). Some telescopes, such as the [[Sky Mirror]] and [[liquid metal telescope]]s, also use all-metal mirrors.\n\nMirrors that reflect only part of the light, while transmitting some of the rest, can be made with very thin metal layers or suitable combinations of dielectric layers.  They are typically used as [[beamsplitter]]s. A [[dichroic  mirror]], in particular, has surface that reflects certain wavelengths of light, while letting other wavelenths pass through.  A [[cold mirror]] is a dichroic mirror that efficiently reflets the entire [[visible light spectrum]] while transmitting [[infrared]] wavelengths.  A [[hot mirror]] is the opposite: it reflects infrared light while transmitting visible light.   Dichroic mirrors are often used as filters to remove undesired components of the light in cameras and measuring instruments.\n\nAn [[active mirror]] will produce reflected beams that have more [[power (physics)|power]] than the incident beams. They are used to make [[disk laser]]s. The amplification is typically over a narrow range of [[wavelength]]s, and requires an external source of power.<ref name=wang2017/>\n\nIn [[X-ray optics|X-ray telescopes]], the [[X-ray]]s incide on a highly precise metal surface at almost grazing angles, and only a small fraction of the rays are reflected.<ref name=pro00/>  In [[flying relativistic mirrors]] conceived for [[X-ray laser]]s, the reflecting surface is a spherical [[shockwave]] (wake wave) created in a in a low-density [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] by a very intense laser-pulse, and moving at an extremely high velocity.<ref name=lewis2008/>\n\nA [[nonlinear_optics#Optical_phase_conjugation|phase-conjugating mirror]] uses [[nonlinear optics]] to reverse the phase difference between incident beams.  Such mirrors may be used, for example, for combination and self-guiding of laser beams and correction of atmospheric distortions in imaging systems.<ref name=okul1980/><ref name=okul2014/><ref name=boyd1997/>\n\n[[File:UniversumUNAM27.JPG|thumb|upright|Photographer taking picture of himself in curved mirror at the [[Universum (UNAM)|Universum museum]] in Mexico City]]\n\n==Physical principles==\nWhen a sufficiently narrow beam of light is reflected at a point of a surface, the [[surface normal|surface's normal direction]] <math>\\vec n</math> will be the bisector of the angle formed by the two beams at that point.  That is, the [[direction vector]] <math>\\vec u</math> towards the incident beams's source, the normal vector <math>\\vec n</math>, and direction vector <math>\\vec v</math> of the reflected beam will be [[coplanarity|coplanar]], and the  the angle between <math>\\vec n</math> and <math>\\vec v</math> will be equal to the  [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] between <math>\\vec n</math> and <math>\\vec u</math>, but of opposite sign.<ref name=katz2016/>  \n\nThis property can be explained by the physics of an [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic]] [[plane wave]] that  is incident to a flat surface that is [[electrical conductance|electrically conductive]] or where the [[speed of light]] changes abruptly, as between two materials with different indices of refraction. \n\n* When [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] beams of light are reflected on a plane surface, the reflected rays will be parallel too.  \n\n* If the reflecting surface is concave, the reflected beans will be [[convergence|convergent]], at least to some extent and for some distance from the surface.  \n\n* A convex mirror, on the other hand, will reflect parallel rays towards [[divergence|divergent]] diections.\n\nMore specifically, a concave parabolic mirror (whose surface is a part of a  paraboloid of revolution) will  reflect rays that are parallel to its [[axis (geometry)|axis]] into rays that pass through its [[focus (optics)|focus]].  Conversely, a parabolic concave mirror will reflect any ray that comes from its focus towards a direction parallel to its axis.  If a concave mirror surface is a part of a [[prolate ellipsoid]], it will reflect any ray coming from one focus towards the other focus.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\nA convex parabolic mirror, on the other hand, will reflect rays that are parallel to its axis into rays that seem to emanate from the focus of the surface, behind the mirror.  Conversely, it will reflect incoming rays that converge towars that point into rays parallel that are to the axis.  A convex mirror that is part of a prolate ellipsoid will reflect rays that converge towards one focus into divergent rays that seem to emanate from the other focus.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\nSpherical mirrors do not reflect parallel rays to rays that converge to or diverge from a single point, or vice-versa, due to [[spherical aberration]].   However, a spherical mirror whose diameter is sufficiently small compared to the sphere's radius will behave very similarly to a parabolic mirror whose axis goes through the mirror's center and the center of that sphere; so that spherical mirrors can substitute for parabolic ones in many applications.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\nA similar aberration occurs with parabolic mirrors when the incident rays are parallel among themselves but not parallel to the mirror's axis, or are divergent from a point that is not the focus \u2014 as when trying to form an image of an objet that is near the mirror or spans a wide angle as seen from it.  However, this aberration can be sufficiently small if the object image is sufficiently far from the mirror and spans a sufficiently small angle around its axis.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\n[[File:WW1AcousticMirrorKilnsea(PaulGlazzard)Jan2007.jpg|thumb|{{convert|4.5|m|ft|adj=on}} high acoustic mirror near [[Kilnsea]] Grange, East Yorkshire, UK]]\n[[File:Hot mirror for a camera.jpg|thumb|A hot mirror used in a camera to reduce red eye]]\n\n==Mirror images==\n[[File:Mirror statue - Gy\u0151r, 2015.10.31.JPG|thumb|A large convex mirror. Distortions in the image increase with the viewing distance.]]\n{{Main|Mirror image}}\nObjects viewed in a (plane) mirror will appear laterally inverted (e.g., if one raises one's right hand, the image's left hand will appear to go up in the mirror), but not vertically inverted (in the image a person's head still appears above their body).<ref name=lard1845/> However, a mirror does not usually \"swap\" left and right any more than it swaps top and bottom. A mirror typically reverses the forward/backward axis. To be precise, it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface (the normal). Because left and right are defined relative to front-back and top-bottom, the \"flipping\" of front and back results in the perception of a left-right reversal in the image. (If you stand side-on to a mirror, the mirror really does reverse your left and right, because that's the direction perpendicular to the mirror.)\n\nLooking at an image of oneself with the front-back axis flipped results in the perception of an image with its left-right axis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, your right hand remains directly opposite your real right hand, but it is perceived as the left hand of your image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image is actually front-back reversed, which is an effect similar to the [[hollow-mask illusion]]. Notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object.\n\nFor things that may be considered as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In the same way that text on a piece of paper appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between their legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.\n\n== Manufacturing ==\n[[File:Four mirrors - dielectric aluminum silver and chrome.jpg|thumb|Four different mirrors, showing the difference in reflectivity.

Stacks may consist of a few to hundreds of individual coats.]]\n\nMirrors are manufactured by applying a [[silvering|reflective coating]] to a suitable [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]].<ref name=lanz2012/> The most common substrate is glass, due to its transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass on one side and the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.\n\nIn classical antiquity, mirrors were made of solid metal (bronze, later silver)<ref name=whit2013/> and were generally too expensive for use by common people, although during the [[Roman Empire]] even maid servants used widespread silver mirrors;<ref name=roma2019/> they were also prone to [[corrosion]]. Due to the low [[reflectivity]] of polished metal, these mirrors also gave a darker image than modern ones, making them unsuitable for indoor use with the artificial lighting of the time ([[candle]]s or [[lantern]]s).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe method of making mirrors out of [[flat glass|plate glass]] was invented by 13th-century Venetian glassmakers on the island of [[Murano]], who covered the back of the glass with an [[amorphous]] coat of [[tin]] using a [[Gilding#Fire-gilding|fire-gilding]] technique, obtaining near-perfect and undistorted reflection. For over one hundred years, Venetian mirrors installed in richly decorated frames served as luxury decorations for palaces throughout Europe, but the secret of the mercury process eventually arrived in London and Paris during the 17th century, due to industrial espionage. French workshops succeeded in large-scale industrialization of the process, eventually making mirrors affordable to the masses, although mercury's [[toxicity]] (a primary ingredient in gilding, which was boiled away forming noxious vapours) remained a problem.<ref name=iriw2018/>\n\nIn modern times, the mirror substrate is shaped, polished and cleaned, and is then coated. Glass mirrors are most often coated with silver<ref name=mlink2014/> or aluminium,<ref name=saun2004/> implemented by a series of coatings:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n# [[Tin(II) chloride]]\n# Silver\n# Chemical [[catalyst|activator]]\n# Copper\n# [[Paint]]\n\nThe [[tin(II) chloride]] is applied because silver will not bond with the glass. The activator causes the tin/silver to harden. Copper is added for long-term durability.<ref name=howm305/> The [[paint]] protects the coating on the back of the mirror from scratches<ref name=wats1986/> and other accidental damage.\n\nIn some applications, generally those that are cost-sensitive or that require great durability, such as for mounting in a prison cell, mirrors may be made from a single, bulk material such as polished metal. However, metals consist of small crystals (grains) separated by grain boundaries. Thus, crystalline metals do not reflect with perfect uniformity.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.2,8}} Other methods like wet-deposition or electroplating produce a non-crystalline coating of [[amorphous metal]] (metallic glass). Lacking any grain boundaries, the amorphous coatings have higher reflectivity than crystalline metals of the same type. Electroplating must be performed by first coating the glass with carbon, to make the surface electrically conductive, thus the adhesion is often not as good as with wet-deposition. Both lack the ability to produce perfectly uniform thicknesses with high precision.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.3,107}} When high precision or reflectivity is not a requirement, the coating may be placed on the back of the mirror so that the light passes through the glass, and the coating is the second surface it encounters. Therefore, these are called second-surface mirrors, which have the added benefit of high durability, because the glass substrate can protect the coating from damage.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.2,107}}\n\nFor technical applications such as [[laser]] mirrors, the reflective coating is typically applied by [[vacuum deposition]]. Vacuum deposition provides an effective means of producing a very uniform coating, and controlling the thickness with high precision.<ref name=ReferenceA/> In applications where great precision and low losses are required, the coated side of the mirror may be the first material encountered by the light, referred to as a first-surface mirror. This eliminates [[refraction]] and double reflections, also called \"ghost reflections\" (a weak reflection from the surface of the glass, and a stronger one from the reflecting metal), and reduces absorption of light by the mirror.<ref name=scha2011/> Technical mirrors may use a silver, aluminium, or gold coating (the latter typically for [[infrared]] mirrors), and achieve reflectivities of 90\u201395% when new. A hard, protective, transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent [[oxidation]] of the reflective layer and scratching of the soft metal.\n\nApplications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability, where wide [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is not essential, use [[dielectric mirror|dielectric coatings]], which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.997% over a limited range of wavelengths. Because they are often chemically stable and do not conduct electricity, dielectric coatings are almost always applied by methods of vacuum deposition, and most commonly by evaporation deposition. Because the coatings are usually transparent, absorption losses are negligible. Unlike with metals, the reflectivity of the individual dielectric-coatings is a function of [[Snell's law]] known as the [[Fresnel equations]], determined by the difference in [[refractive index]] between layers. Therefore, the thickness and index of the coatings can be adjusted to be centered on any wavelength. Vacuum deposition can be achieved in a number of ways, including sputtering, evaporation deposition, arc deposition, reactive-gas deposition, and ion plating, among many others.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.103,107}}\n\n=== Tolerances ===\n[[File:Hubble mirror polishing.jpg|thumb|Polishing the primary mirror for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. A deviation in the surface quality of approximately 4\u03bb resulted in poor images initially, which was eventually compensated for using [[Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement|corrective optics]].]]\n[[File:Laser dielectric output coupler centered @ 550nm.png|thumb|A dielectric, laser output-coupler that is 75\u201380% reflective between 500 and 600 nm. Left: The mirror is highly reflective to yellow and green but highly transmissive to red and blue. Right: The mirror transmits 25% of the 589 nm laser light. Because the smoke particles [[Diffraction|diffract]] more light than they reflect, the beam appears much brighter when reflecting back toward the observer.]]\n[[File:Mirror distortion and artifacts due to flatness errors.png|thumb|Flatness errors, like rippled dunes across the surface, produced these artifacts, distortion, and low image quality in the [[far field]] reflection of a household mirror.]]\n\nMirrors can be manufactured to a wide range of [[engineering tolerance]]s, including [[reflectivity]], surface quality, [[surface roughness]], or [[Transmittance|transmissivity]], depending on the desired application. These tolerances can range from low, such as found in a normal household-mirror, to extremely high, like those used in lasers or telescopes. Increasing the tolerances allows better and more precise imaging or beam transmission over longer distances. In imaging systems this can help reduce anomalies ([[Artifact (error)|artifacts]]), distortion or blur, but at a much higher cost. Where viewing distances are relatively close or high precision is not a concern, lower tolerances can be used to make effective mirrors at affordable costs.\n\n====Reflectivity====\nThe reflectivity of a mirror is determined by the percentage of reflected light per the total of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be absorbed by the coating, the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often determined by the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of the coating is sufficient to prevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum is harder, less expensive, and more resistant to tarnishing than silver, and will reflect 85 to 90% of the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but experiences a drop in its reflectance between 800 and 900&nbsp;nm. Gold is very soft and easily scratched, costly, yet does not tarnish. Gold is greater than 96% reflective to near and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000&nbsp;nm, but poorly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 600&nbsp;nm (yellow). Silver is expensive, soft, and quickly tarnishes, but has the highest reflectivity in the visual to near-infrared of any metal. Silver can reflect up to 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long as 2000&nbsp;nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350&nbsp;nm. Dielectric mirrors can reflect greater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths, ranging from a bandwidth of only 10&nbsp;nm to as wide as 100&nbsp;nm for [[tunable laser]]s. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them from scratching or tarnishing. Dielectric materials are typically very hard and relatively cheap, however the number of coats needed generally makes it an expensive process. In mirrors with low tolerances, the coating thickness may be reduced to save cost, and simply covered with paint to absorb transmission.<ref name=ReferenceB/>\n\n====Surface quality====\nSurface quality, or surface accuracy, measures the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface shape. Increasing the surface quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and [[Aberration (optics)|aberration]] in images, and helps increase [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]], [[collimation]], and reduce unwanted [[beam divergence|divergence]] in beams. For plane mirrors, this is often described in terms of [[Flatness (manufacturing)|flatness]], while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The surface quality is typically measured with items like [[interferometer]]s or [[optical flat]]s, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (\u03bb). These deviations can be much larger or much smaller than the surface roughness. A normal household-mirror made with [[float glass]] may have flatness tolerances as low as 9\u201314\u03bb per inch (25.4&nbsp;mm), equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 [[nanometer]]s from perfect flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as \u03bb/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12&nbsp;nm) across the entire surface.<ref name=cheng2009/><ref name=ReferenceB/> The surface quality can be affected by factors such as temperature changes, internal stress in the substrate, or even bending effects that occur when combining materials with different coefficients of [[thermal expansion]], similar to a [[bimetallic strip]].<ref name=leon2006/>\n\n====Surface roughness====\n[[Surface roughness]] describes the texture of the surface, often in terms of the depth of the microscopic scratches left by the polishing operations. Surface roughness determines how much of the reflection is specular and how much diffuses, controlling how sharp or blurry the image will be.\n\nFor perfectly specular reflection, the surface roughness must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater than an inch (~25&nbsp;mm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, continental ice-sheets, or desert sand, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few hundred-thousandths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce specular reflection. For wavelengths that are approaching or are even shorter than the [[Atomic radius|diameter of the atoms]], such as [[X-ray]]s, specular reflection can only be produced by surfaces that are at a [[grazing incidence]] from the rays.\n\nSurface roughness is typically measured in [[micron]]s, wavelength, or [[Sandpaper#Grit size table|grit size]], with ~80,000\u2013100,000&nbsp;grit or ~\u00bd\u03bb\u2013\u00bc\u03bb being \"optical quality\".<ref name=duzg2011/><ref name=ReferenceB/><ref name=warn/>\n\n====Transmissivity====\nTransmissivity is determined by the percentage of light transmitted per the incident light. Transmissivity is usually the same from both first and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For transmissive mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, [[beam splitter]]s, or laser [[output coupler]]s, the transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the transmissivity. For the substrate, the material used must also have good transmissivity to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as [[zinc selenide]] or [[synthetic sapphire]] may be used for infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.<ref name=greav1989/>{{rp|p.104\u2013108}}\n\n====Wedge====\nWedge errors are caused by the deviation of the surfaces from perfect parallelism. An [[optical wedge]] is the angle formed between two plane-surfaces (or between the principle planes of curved surfaces) due to manufacturing errors or limitations, causing one edge of the mirror to be slightly thicker than the other. Nearly all mirrors and optics with parallel faces have some slight degree of wedge, which is usually measured in [[second of arc|seconds]] or [[minutes of arc]]. For first-surface mirrors, wedges can introduce alignment deviations in mounting hardware. For second-surface or transmissive mirrors, wedges can have a prismatic effect on the light, deviating its trajectory or, to a very slight degree, its color, causing [[chromatic aberration|chromatic]] and other forms of [[Optical aberration|aberration]]. In some instances, a slight wedge is desirable, such as in certain laser systems where stray reflections from the uncoated surface are better dispersed than reflected back through the medium.<ref name=walk1998/><ref name=klei1989/>\n\n====Surface defects====\nSurface defects are small-scale, discontinuous imperfections in the surface smoothness. Surface defects are larger (in some cases much larger) than the surface roughness, but only affect small, localized portions of the entire surface. These are typically found as scratches, digs, pits (often from bubbles in the glass), sleeks (scratches from prior, larger grit polishing operations that were not fully removed by subsequent polishing grits), edge chips, or blemishes in the coating. These defects are often an unavoidable side-effect of manufacturing limitations, both in cost and machine precision. If kept low enough, in most applications these defects will rarely have any adverse effect, unless the surface is located at an image plane where they will show up directly. For applications that require extremely low scattering of light, extremely high reflectance, or low absorption due to high energy-levels that could destroy the mirror, such as lasers or [[Fabry-Perot interferometer]]s, the surface defects must be kept to a minimum.<ref name=azop2016/>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Jekyll.and.Hyde.Ch10.Drawing2.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''cheval glass'']]\n[[File:mirror.globe.arp.500pix.jpg|thumb|upright|Reflections in a spherical convex mirror.

A classic example of the latter is the [[wikt:cheval glass#English|cheval glass]], which may be tilted.\n\n=== Safety and easier viewing ===\n;Convex mirrors\n:Convex mirrors provide a wider [[field of view]] than flat mirrors,<ref name=king2000/> and are often used on vehicles,<ref name=ushw1979/> especially large trucks, to minimize [[Blind spot (automobile)|blind spots]]. They are sometimes placed at [[road junction]]s, and corners of sites such as [[parking lot]]s to allow people to see around corners to avoid crashing into other vehicles or [[shopping cart]]s. They are also sometimes used as part of security systems, so that a single [[video camera]] can show more than one [[angle]] at a time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Convex mirrors as decoration are used in interior design to provide a predominantly experiential effect.<ref name=charm2016/>\n\n;[[Mouth mirror]]s or \"dental mirrors\"\n:Mouth mirrors or \"dental mirrors\" are used by dentists to allow indirect vision and lighting within the mouth. Their reflective surfaces may be either flat or curved.<ref name=ande2000/> Mouth mirrors are also commonly used by [[mechanic]]s to allow vision in tight spaces and around corners in equipment.\n;[[Rear-view mirror]]s\n:Rear-view mirrors are widely used in and on vehicles (such as automobiles, or bicycles), to allow drivers to see other vehicles coming up behind them.<ref name=kali/>  On rear-view sunglasses, the left end of the left glass and the right end of the right glass work as mirrors.\n\n=== One-way mirrors and windows ===\n{{Main|One-way mirror}}\n;One-way mirrors\n:One-way mirrors  (also called two-way mirrors) work by overwhelming dim transmitted light with bright reflected light.<ref name=twow2012/> A true one-way mirror that actually allows light to be transmitted in one direction only without requiring external energy is not possible as it violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].{{Citation needed|reason=A common sense explanation is not sufficient.

The signal can be used over long distances, possibly up to {{convert|60|km}} on a clear day. This technique was used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and numerous [[military|militaries]] to transmit information between distant outposts.\n\nMirrors can also be used for search to attract the attention of [[search and rescue]] parties. Specialized type of mirrors are available and are often included in military [[survival kit]]s.\n\n=== Technology ===\n\n==== Televisions and projectors ====\n\nMicroscopic mirrors are a core element of many of the largest [[HDTV|high-definition]] televisions and [[video projector]]s. A common technology of this type is [[Texas Instruments]]' [[digital light processing|DLP]]. A DLP chip is a postage stamp-sized microchip whose surface is an array of millions of microscopic mirrors. The picture is created as the individual mirrors move to either reflect light toward the projection surface ([[pixel]] on), or toward a light absorbing surface (pixel off).\n\nOther projection technologies involving mirrors include [[LCoS]]. Like a DLP chip, LCoS is a microchip of similar size, but rather than millions of individual mirrors, there is a single mirror that is actively shielded by a [[liquid crystal]] matrix with up to millions of [[pixels]]. The picture, formed as light, is either reflected toward the projection surface (pixel on), or absorbed by the activated [[LCD]] pixels (pixel off). LCoS-based televisions and projectors often use 3 chips, one for each primary color.\n\nLarge mirrors are used in rear projection televisions. Light (for example from a DLP as mentioned above) is \"folded\" by one or more mirrors so that the television set is compact.\n\n==== Solar power ====\n[[File:Parabolic trough near Harper Lake in California front and back.jpg|thumb|Parabolic troughs near [[Harper Lake]] in [[California]]]]\nMirrors are integral parts of a [[solar power]] plant. The one shown in the adjacent picture uses [[concentrated solar power]] from an array of [[parabolic trough]]s.<ref name=pale2015/>\n\n==== Instruments ====\n{{See also|Mirror support cell}}\n[[File:E-ELT mirror segments under test.jpg|thumb|[[E-ELT]] mirror segments under test]]\n[[Telescope]]s and other precision instruments use ''front silvered'' or [[first surface mirrors]], where the reflecting surface is placed on the front (or first) surface of the glass (this eliminates reflection from glass surface ordinary back mirrors have). Some of them use silver, but most are aluminium, which is more reflective at short wavelengths than silver.\nAll of these coatings are easily damaged and require special handling.\nThey reflect 90% to 95% of the incident light when new.\nThe coatings are typically applied by [[vacuum deposition]].\nA protective overcoat is usually applied before the mirror is removed from the vacuum, because the coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air. ''Front silvered'' mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality. There are optical mirrors such as [[mangin mirror]]s that are ''second surface mirrors'' (reflective coating on the rear surface) as part of their optical designs, usually to correct [[optical aberration]]s.<ref name=boba2014/>\n\n[[File:Super-thin Mirror Under Test at ESO.jpg|thumb|left|Deformable thin-shell mirror. It is 1120 millimetres across but just 2 millimetres thick, making it much thinner than most glass windows.<ref name=eso2013/>]]\n\nThe reflectivity of the mirror coating can be measured using a [[Spectrophotometer|reflectometer]] and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some [[optical]] work to make [[cold mirror]]s and [[hot mirror]]s. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to [[infrared]] light.\n\nA hot mirror is the opposite, the coating preferentially reflects infrared. Mirror surfaces are sometimes given thin film overcoatings both to retard degradation of the surface and to increase their reflectivity in parts of the spectrum where they will be used. For instance, aluminum mirrors are commonly coated with silicon dioxide or magnesium fluoride. The reflectivity as a function of wavelength depends on both the thickness of the coating and on how it is applied.\n\n[[File:Dielectric laser mirror from a dye laser.JPG|thumb|A dielectric coated mirror used in a [[dye laser]]. The mirror is over 99% reflective at 550 [[nanometer]]s, (yellow), but will allow most other colors to pass through.]]\n[[File:Laserr mirror from a dye laser for use with rhodamine.jpg|thumb|A dielectric mirror used in [[tunable laser]]s. With a center wavelength of 600 nm and bandwidth of 100 nm, the coating is totally reflective to the orange construction paper, but only reflects the reddish hues from the blue paper.]]\nFor scientific [[optics|optical]] work, [[dielectric mirror]]s are often used. These are glass (or sometimes other material) substrates on which one or more layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified. The best mirrors of this type can reflect &gt;99.999% of the light (in a narrow range of wavelengths) which is incident on the mirror. Such mirrors are often used in [[laser]]s.\n\nIn astronomy, [[adaptive optics]] is a technique to measure variable image distortions and adapt a [[deformable mirror]] accordingly on a timescale of milliseconds, to compensate for the distortions.\n\nAlthough most mirrors are designed to reflect visible light, surfaces reflecting other forms of electromagnetic radiation are also called \"mirrors\". The mirrors for other ranges of [[electromagnetic waves]] are used in\noptics and [[astronomy]]. Mirrors for radio waves (sometimes known as reflectors) are important elements of [[radio telescope]]s.\n\n==== Face-to-face mirrors ====\nTwo or more mirrors aligned exactly parallel and facing each other can give an infinite regress of reflections, called an [[infinity mirror]] effect. Some devices use this to generate multiple reflections:\n* [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer]]\n* [[Laser]] (which contains an [[optical cavity]])\n* 3D [[Kaleidoscope]] to concentrate light<ref name=more2010/>\n* momentum-enhanced [[solar sail]]<ref name=meyer1987/>\n\n==== Military applications ====\nIt has been said that [[Archimedes]] used a large array of mirrors to burn [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ships during an attack on Syracuse. This has never been proven or disproved. On the TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'', a team from [[MIT]] tried to recreate the famous \"Archimedes Death Ray\". They were unsuccessful at starting a fire on the ship.<ref name=myth2019/> Previous attempts to light the boat on fire using only the bronze mirrors available in Archimedes' time were unsuccessful, and the time taken to ignite the craft would have made its use impractical, resulting in the ''MythBusters'' team deeming the myth \"busted\". It was however found that the mirrors made it very difficult for the passengers of the targeted boat to see, likely helping to cause their defeat, which may have been the origin of the myth. (See [[solar power tower]] for a practical use of this technique.)\n\n==== Seasonal lighting ====\n[[File:Kibble Palace Mirror.JPG|left|thumb|A multi-facet mirror in the [[Kibble Palace]] conservatory, [[Glasgow]], Scotland]]\n\n<!-- If this technique becomes popular, don't let this section grow into a vast list of examples. -->\nDue to its location in a steep-sided valley, the Italian town of [[Viganella]] gets no direct sunlight for seven weeks each winter.

Early examples include the Campbell Center in [[Dallas]], which opened in 1972,<ref name=brown2012/> and the [[John Hancock Tower]] in Boston.\n\nMore recently, two skyscrapers designed by architect [[Rafael Vi\u00f1oly]], the [[Vdara]] in Las Vegas and [[20 Fenchurch Street]] in London, have experienced unusual problems due to their concave curved glass exteriors acting as respectively cylindrical and spherical reflectors for sunlight.  In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflected off the Vdara's south-facing tower could singe swimmers in the hotel pool, as well as melting plastic cups and shopping bags; employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the \"Vdara death ray\",<ref name=vdara2010/> aka the \"[[fryscraper]].\" In 2013, sunlight reflecting off 20 Fenchurch Street melted parts of a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar car]] parked nearby and scorching or igniting the carpet of a nearby barber shop.<ref name=fench2013/>  This building had been nicknamed the \"walkie-talkie\" because its shape was supposedly similar to a certain model of two-way radio; but after its tendency to overheat surrounding objects became known, the nickname changed to the \"walkie-scorchie.\"\n\n=== Fine art ===\n\n==== Paintings ====\n[[File:Titian - Venus with a Mirror - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus with a Mirror]]'']]\nPainters depicting someone gazing into a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This is a kind of abstraction\u2014in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and [[Photography|still photography]] an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself in the mirror, and yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection. In the psychology of perception, this is known as the [[Venus effect]].\n\nThe mirror is the central device in some of the greatest of European paintings:\n* [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re]]''\n* [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus effect|Venus with a Mirror]]''\n* [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''\n* [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[List of Picasso artworks 1931\u20131940|Girl before a Mirror]]'' (1932)\n* [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s ''[[Rokeby Venus]]''\n* [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s ''[[Las Meninas]]'', wherein the viewer is both the watcher (of a self-portrait in progress) and the watched, and the many adaptations of that painting in various media\n* [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]'s ''Venus with a Mirror''\n\nMirrors have been used by artists to create works and hone their craft:\n* [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] discovered linear perspective with the help of the mirror.<ref name=camp2014/>\n* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] called the mirror the \"master of painters\". He recommended, \"When you wish to see whether your whole picture accords with what you have portrayed from nature take a mirror and reflect the actual object in it.

Mostly they were used as an accessory for personal hygiene but also as tokens of courtly love, made from [[Ivory carving|ivory]] in the ivory carving centers in Paris, Cologne and the Southern Netherlands.<ref name=court2018/> They also had their uses in religious contexts as they were integrated in a special form of [[Pilgrim badge|pilgrims badges]] or pewter/lead mirror boxes<ref name=bojm2018/> since the late 14th century. Burgundian ducal inventories show us that the dukes owned a mass of mirrors or objects with mirrors, not only with religious iconography or inscriptions, but combined with reliquaries, religious paintings or other objects that were distinctively used for personal piety.<ref name=sche2013/> Considering mirrors in paintings and book illumination as depicted artifacts and trying to draw conclusions about their functions from their depicted setting, one of these functions is to be an aid in personal prayer to achieve self-knowledge and knowledge of God, in accord with contemporary theological sources. E.g. the famous [[Arnolfini Portrait|Arnolfini]]-Wedding by [[Jan van Eyck]] shows a constellation of objects that can be recognized as one which would allow a praying man to use them for his personal piety: the mirror surrounded by scenes of the Passion to reflect on it and on oneself, a [[rosary]] as a device in this process, the veiled and cushioned bench to use as a [[prie-dieu]], and the abandoned shoes that point in the direction in which the praying man kneeled.<ref name=sche2013/> The metaphorical meaning of depicted mirrors is complex and many-layered, e.g. as an attribute of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], the \u201cspeculum sine macula\u201d, or as attributes of scholarly and theological wisdom and knowledge as they appear in book illuminations of different [[Four Evangelists|evangelists]] and authors of theological treatises. Depicted mirrors \u2013 orientated on the physical properties of a real mirror \u2013 can be seen as metaphors of knowledge and reflection and are thus able to remind the beholder to reflect and get to know himself. The mirror may function simultaneously as a symbol and a device of a moral appeal. That is also the case if it is shown in combination with virtues and vices, a combination which also occurs more frequently in the 15th century: The moralizing layers of mirror metaphors remind the beholder to examine himself thoroughly according to his own virtuous or vicious life. This is all the more true if the mirror is combined with iconography of death. Not only is Death as a corpse or skeleton holding the mirror for the still living personnel of paintings, illuminations and prints, but the skull appears on the convex surfaces of depicted mirrors, showing the painted and real beholder his future face.<ref name=sche2013/>\n\n=== Decoration ===\n[[File:Overmantel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fireplace mantel|Chimneypiece]] and overmantel mirror, c. 1750 V&A Museum no. 738:1 to 3\u20131897]]\n[[File:Demo Day 2016 - Design Center (19).jpg|thumb|Glasses with mirrors \u2013 Prezi HQ]]\n[[File:Dunville's Whisky Pub Mirror 01.jpeg|thumb|A bar mirror bearing the logo of [[Dunville & Co#Dunville's Whisky|Dunville's Whiskey]].]]\nMirrors are frequently used in [[interior decoration]] and as ornaments:\n* Mirrors, typically large and unframed, are frequently used in [[interior decoration]] to create an illusion of space and amplify the apparent size of a room.<ref name=alic2016/> They come also framed in a variety of forms, such as the [[pier glass]] and the overmantel mirror.\n* Mirrors are used also in some schools of [[feng shui]], an ancient [[Culture of China|Chinese]] practice of placement and arrangement of space to achieve harmony with the environment.\n* The softness of old mirrors is sometimes replicated by contemporary artisans for use in [[interior design]].

The text itself utilizes a narrative that mirrors that of its predecessor, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.<ref name=carr1872/>\n* In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s novel, '''''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''''' (1890), a [[portrait]] serves as a magical mirror that reflects the true visage of the perpetually youthful protagonist, as well as the effect on his soul of each sinful act.<ref name=call2009/><ref name=wild2010/>\n* The short story '''''[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]''''' by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] begins with the phrase \"I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction of a mirror and an encyclopedia\" and contains other references to mirrors.\n* ''The Trap'', a short story by [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and Henry S. Whitehead, centers around a mirror. \"It was on a certain Thursday morning in December that the whole thing began with that unaccountable motion I thought I saw in my antique Copenhagen mirror.

The greatest danger to visitors upon entering the plane is the instant creation of a mirror-self with the opposite alignment of the original visitor.\n* ''The Mirror Thief'', a novel by Martin Seay (2016),<ref name=seay2016/> includes a fictional account of industrial espionage surrounding mirror manufacturing in 16th century Venice.\n* ''[[The Reaper's Image]]'', a short story by [[Stephen King]], concerns a rare Elizabethan mirror that displays the Reaper's image when viewed, which symbolises the death of the viewer.\n* Kilgore Trout, a protagonist of [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', believes that mirrors are windows to other universes, and refers to them as \"leaks,\" a recurring motif in the book.\n\n== Mirrors and animals ==\n{{Main|Mirror test}}\n\nOnly a few animal species have been shown to have the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror, most of them [[mammal]]s.

The angle of the incident light (represented by both the light in the mirror and the shadow behind it) matches the exact angle of reflection (the reflected light shining on the table).]]\n\nA '''mirror''' or '''reflector''' is an object such that each narrow beam of [[light]] that incides on its surface bounces (is [[reflection (physics)|reflected]]) in a single direction. This property, called [[specular reflection]], distinguishes a mirror from objects that scatter light in many directions (such as flat-white paint), let it pass through them (such as a [[lens]] or [[prism (optics)|prism]]), or absorb it.\n\nMost mirrors behave as such only for certain ranges of wavelength, direction, and polarization of the incident light; most commonly for [[visible light]], but also for other regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from [[X-rays]] to [[radio wave]]s. A mirror will generally reflect only a fraction of the incident light; even the best mirrors may scatter, absorb, or transmit a small portion of it.  If the mirror's width is only a few times the [[wavelength]] of the light, a significant part of the light will also be [[diffraction|diffracted]] instead.  An object that is a mirror when examined at a small scale (like a [[ball bearing|bearing ball]]) may seem to be scattering light when examined at a larger scale.  \n\nWhen looking at a mirror, one will see a [[mirror image]] or reflected image of objects in the environment, formed by light emitted or scattered by them and reflected by the mirror towards one's eyes.  This effect gives the illusion that those objects are behind the mirror, or (sometimes) [[real image|in front of it]].  A [[plane mirror]] will yield a real-looking undistorted image, while a [[curved mirror]] may distort, magnify, or reduce the image in various ways.\n\nA mirror is commonly used for inspecting oneself, such as during [[personal grooming]]; hence the old-fashioned name '''looking glass'''.<ref name=camboldf/>   This use, which dates from the Prehistory,<ref name=pend2004/> overlaps with uses in [[decoration]] and [[architecture]]. Mirrors are also used to view other items that are not directly visible because of obstructions; examples include [[rear-view mirror]]s in vehicles, [[curved_mirror#Uses_of_convex_mirrors|security mirror]]s in or around buildings, and [[mouth mirror|dentist's mirror]]s.  Mirrors are also used in optical and scientific apparatus such as [[telescope]]s, [[laser]]s, [[camera]]s, [[periscope]]s, and industrial machinery.\n\nThe terms \"mirror\" and \"reflector\" can be used for devices that reflect other types of [[radiation]] according to the same laws.  An '''[[acoustic mirror]]''' reflects sound waves, and may be used for applications such as [[directional microphone]]s, [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies, [[sonar]], and [[sea floor mapping]].<ref name=U1/>  An '''[[atomic mirror]]''' reflects [[matter waves]], and can be used for atomic [[interferometry]] and atomic [[holography]].\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Egypt, New Kingdom, Dynasty 18 - Caryatid Mirror - 1983.196 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif\n| width1 = 152\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = NAMA Femme au miroir.jpg\n| width2 = 210\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' Bronze mirror, [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]], 1540\u20131296 BC, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (USA)<br>'''Right:''' seated woman holding a mirror; [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[lekythos]] by the [[Sabouroff Painter]], c. 470\u2013460 BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] (Greece)\n}}\n[[File:Naples National Archaeological Museum (14842094122).jpg|thumb|[[Roman art|Roman fresco]] of a woman fixing her hair using a mirror, from [[Stabiae]], Italy, 1st century AD]]\n[[File:Histoire de femme Gu Kai Zhi.jpg|thumb|'Adorning Oneself', detail from 'Admonitions of the Instructress to the Palace Ladies', [[Tang dynasty]] copy of an original by [[Chinese painting|Chinese painter]] [[Gu Kaizhi]], c. 344\u2013405 AD]]\n[[File:Lady looking into mirror Belur Halebidu.jpg|thumb|upright|A sculpture of a lady looking into a mirror, from [[Halebidu]], [[India]], 12th century]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe first mirrors used by humans were most likely pools of dark, still water, or water collected in a primitive vessel of some sort. The requirements for making a good mirror are a surface with a very high degree of [[Flatness (mathematics)|flatness]] (preferably but not necessarily with high [[reflectivity]]), and a [[surface roughness]] smaller than the wavelength of the light. \n\nThe earliest manufactured mirrors were pieces of polished stone such as [[obsidian]], a naturally occurring [[volcanic glass]].<ref name=fior2009/> Examples of obsidian mirrors found in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day Turkey) have been dated to around 6000&nbsp;BC.<ref name=enoch/> Mirrors of polished copper were crafted in [[Mesopotamia]] from 4000&nbsp;BC,<ref name=enoch/> and in ancient Egypt from around 3000&nbsp;BC.<ref name=stoc/> Polished stone mirrors from Central and South America date from around 2000&nbsp;BC onwards.<ref name=enoch/> \n\n===Bronze Age to Early Middle Age===\nBy the [[Bronze Age]] most cultures had adopted mirrors made from polished discs of [[bronze]], [[copper]] or other metals.<ref name=fior2009/> In China, [[bronze mirror]]s were manufactured from around 2000&nbsp;BC,<ref name=chvoc/> some of the earliest bronze and copper examples being produced by the [[Qijia culture]]. Mirrors made of other metal mixtures ([[alloy]]s) such as copper and tin [[speculum metal]] may have also been produced in China and India.<ref name=need1974/>  Such metal mirrors remained the norm through to [[Greco-Roman]] Antiquity and throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]].<ref name=brit2009/> Mirrors of speculum metal or any precious metal were hard to produce and were only owned by the wealthy.<ref name=hopk1910/> \n\nCommon metal mirrors tarnished and required frequently needed polishing. Bronze mirrors had low reflectivity and poor [[color rendering]], and stone mirrors were much worse in this regard.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.11}} These defects explain the [[New Testament]] reference in [[1 Corinthians 13]] to seeing \"as in a mirror, darkly.\"\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Socrates]], of \"[[know thyself]]\" fame, urged young people to look at themselves in mirrors so that, if they were beautiful, they would become worthy of their beauty, and if they were ugly, they would know how to hide their disgrace through learning.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.106}}\n\n[[Glass]] began to be used for mirrors in the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]], with the development of [[soda-lime glass]] and [[glass blowing]].<ref name=pulk1999/> The Roman scholar [[Pliny the Elder]] claims that artisans in [[Sidon]] (modern-day [[Lebanon]]) were producing glass mirrors coated with [[lead]] or [[gold leaf]] in the back.  The metal provided good reflectivity, and the glass provided a smooth surface and protected the metal from scrathes and tarnishing.<ref  name=plin0077/><ref name=holl2009/><ref name=ande2008/><ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.12}}<ref name=kels2007/>  However, there is no archeological evidence of glass mirrors before the third century.<ref name=degy/>  \n\nThese early glass mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small circular section from from 10 to 20 [[centimetre|cm]] in diameter.  Their surface was either concave or convex, and imperfections tended to distort the image.  Lead-coated mirrors were very thin to prevent cracking by the heat of the molten metal.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.10}}  Due to their poor quality, high cost, and small size, solid-metal mirrors, primarily of steel, remained in common use until the late nineteenth century.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.13}}\n\nSilver-coated metal mirrors were developed in China as early as 500 CE.  The bare metal was coated with an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], then heated it until the [[mercury]] boiled away.<ref name=rapp2009/>\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\nThe evolution of glass mirrors in the [[Middle Ages]] followed improvements in [[glassmaking]] technology.  Glassmakers in [[France]] made flat glass plates by blowing glass bubbles, spinning them rapidly to flatten them, and cutting rectangles out of them. A better method, developed in [[Germany]] and perfected in [[Veniice]]  by the 16th century, was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it along its length, and unroll it onto a flat hot plate.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.11}}  Venetian glassmakers also adopted [[lead glass]] for mirrors, because of its crystal-clarity and its easier workability.  By the 11th century, glass mirrors were being produced in [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Spain]].<ref name=Ajram/>\n\nDuring the early [[Renaissance]], the technique was developed in [[Europe]] of coating glass mirrors with a [[tin]]-mercury amalgam, producing an [[amorphous]] coating with better [[reflectivity]] than crystalline metals and causing little [[thermal shock]] to the glass.<ref name=bonn2011/>{{rp|p.16}} Thedate and location of the discovery is unknown, but by the 16th century Venice was a center of mirror production using this technique. These Venetian mirrors were up to {{convert|40|in|cm}} square.\n\nGood glass mirrors from this period were still extremely expensive luxuries. For example, in the late seventeenth century, the Countess de Fiesque was reported to have traded an entire wheat farm for a mirror, considering it a bargain.<ref name=hads1993/>  \n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nThe invention of the [[ribbon machine]] in the late [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed modern glass panes to be produced in bulk.<ref name=bonn2011/> The [[Saint-Gobain]] factory, founded by royal initiative in France, was an important manufacturer, and [[Bohemia]]n and German glass, often rather cheaper, was also important.\n\nThe invention of the [[silvering|silvered-glass]] mirror is credited to German chemist [[Justus von Liebig]] in 1835.<ref name=lieb185/> His [[wet deposition]] process involved the deposition of a thin layer of metallic silver onto glass through the chemical reduction of [[silver nitrate]]. This [[silvering]] process was adapted for mass manufacturing and led to the greater availability of affordable mirrors.\n\n===Contemporary technologies===\nCurrently mirrors are often produced by the wet deposition of silver, or sometimes nickel or chromium (the latter used most often in automotive mirrors) via [[electroplating]] directly onto the glass substrate.<ref name=mlink2014/>\n\nGlass mirrors for optical instruments are usually produced by [[vacuum deposition]] methods. These techniques can be traced to observations in the 1920s and 1930s that metal was being ejected from [[electrode]]s in [[gas discharge lamp]]s and condensed on the glass walls forming a mirror-like coating.  The phenomenon, called [[sputtering]], was developed into an industrial metal-coating method with the development of [[semiconductor]] technology in the 1970s. \n\nA similar phenomenon had been observed with [[incandescent light bulbs]]: the metal in the hot filament would slowly [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] and condense on the bulb's walls.  This phenomenon was developed into the method of [[evaporation (deposition)|evaporation coating]] by Pohl and Pringsheim in 1912.   [[John D. Strong]] used evaporation coating to make the first [[aluminum]]-coated telescope mirrors in the 1930s.<ref name=matt2004/> The first [[dielectric mirror]] was created in 1937 by Auwarter using evaporated [[rhodium]].<ref name=ReferenceA/>\n\nThe metal coating of glass mirrors is usually protected from abrasion and corrosion by a layer of paint applied over it.  Mirrors for optical instruments often have the metal layer on the front face, so that the light does not have to cross the glass twice.  In these mirrors, the metal may be protected by a thin transparent coating of anon-metallic ([[dielectric]]) material.  The first metallic mirror to be enhanced with a dielectric coating of [[silicon dioxide]] was created by Hass in 1937. In 1939 at the [[Schott Glass]] company, Walter Geffcken invented the first dielectric mirrors to use multilayer coatings.<ref name=ReferenceA/>\n\n===Burning mirrors===\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] in [[Classical Antiquity]] were familar with the use of mirrors to concentrate light.  [[Parabolic mirror]]s were described and studied by the mathematician [[Diocles (mathematician)|Diocles]] in his work ''On Burning Mirrors''.<ref name=fried2001/> [[Ptolemy]] conducted a number of experiments with curved polished iron mirrors,<ref name=pend2004/>{{rp|p.64}} and discussed plane, convex spherical, and concave spherical mirrors in his ''Optics''.<ref name=mark1996/> \n\nParabolic mirrors were also described by the [[Caliphate]] mathematician [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] in the tenth century.<ref name=rash1990/>  The scholar [[Ibn al-Haytham]] discussed [[Curved mirror|concave and convex mirrors]] in both [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] and [[Spherical geometry|spherical geometries]],<ref name=elli1966/> carried out a number of experiments with mirrors, and solved the problem of finding the point on a convex mirror at which a ray coming from one point is reflected to another point.<ref name=Deek/>\n\n==Types of mirrors==\n[[File:Johann Jacob Kirstein 001.JPG|thumb|left|18th century [[vermeil]] mirror in the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts d\u00e9coratifs, Strasbourg]]]]\n\nMirrors can be classified in many ways; including by shape, support and reflective materials, manufaturing methods, and intended application.\n\n===By shape===\nTypical mirror shapes are [[plane mirror|planar]], [[curved mirror#Convex mirrors|convex]], and [[curved mirror#Concave mirrors|concave]].   \n\nThe surface of curved mirrors is often a part of a [[sphere]], for ease of fabrication.  Mirrors that are meant to precisely concentrate parallel rays of light into a point are usually made in the shape of a [[paraboloid of revolution]] instead; they are used in telescopes (form radio waves to X-rays), in antennas to communicate with [[broadcast satellite]]s, and in [[solar furnace]]s.  A [[segmented mirror]], consisting of multiple flat or curved mirrors, properly placed and oriented, may be used instead.\n\nMirrors that are intended to concentrate sunlight onto a long pipe may be a [[circular cylinder]] or of a [[parabolic cylinder]].{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n===By structural material===\n\n====Back-silvered mirrors====\nThe most common mirrors consist of a plate of transparent glass, with a thin reflective layer on the back (the side opposite to the incident and reflected light) backed by a coating that protects that layer against abrasion, tarnishing, and [[corrosion]].  The glass is usually soda-lime glass, but lead glass may be used for decorative effects, and other transparent materials may be used for specific applications.{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\nA plate of transparent [[plastic]] may be used instead of glass, for lighter weight or impact resistance. Alternatively, a flexible transparent plastic film may be bonded to the front and/or back surface of the mirror, to prevent injuries in case the mirror is broken.  Lettering or decorative designs may be printed on the front face of the glass, or formed on the reflective layer. The front surface may have an [[anti-reflection coating]].{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n====Front-silvered mirrors====\nMirrors which are reflective on the front surface (the same side of the incident and reflected light) may be made of any rigid material.  The supporting  material does not need to be transparent, but telescope mirrors often use glass anyway. Often a protective transparent coating is added on top of the reflecting layer, to protects it against abrasion, tarnishing, and corrosion, or to absorb certain wavelengths.{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n====Flexible mirrors====\nThin flexible plastic mirrors are sometimes used for safety, since they cannot shatter or produce sharp flakes. Their flatness is achieved by stretching them on a rigid frame.  These usually consist of a layer of evaporated aluminum between two thin layers of transparent plastic.{{cn|date=May 2020}}\n\n===By reflective material===\n\nIn common mirrors, the reflective layer is usually some metal like silver, [[nickel]], or [[chromium]], deposited by a wet process; or aluminum, deposited by sputtering or evaporation in vacuum. The reflective layer may also be made of one or more layers of transparent materials with suitable [[indices of refraction]].\n\nThe structural material may be a metal, in which case the reflecting layer may be just the surface of the same. Metal concave dishes are often used to reflect infrared light (such as in [[space heater]]s) or [[microwave]]s (as in satellite TV antennas). Some telescopes, such as the [[Sky Mirror]] and [[liquid metal telescope]]s, also use all-metal mirrors.\n\nMirrors that reflect only part of the light, while transmitting some of the rest, can be made with very thin metal layers or suitable combinations of dielectric layers.  They are typically used as [[beamsplitter]]s. A [[dichroic  mirror]], in particular, has surface that reflects certain wavelengths of light, while letting other wavelenths pass through.  A [[cold mirror]] is a dichroic mirror that efficiently reflets the entire [[visible light spectrum]] while transmitting [[infrared]] wavelengths.  A [[hot mirror]] is the opposite: it reflects infrared light while transmitting visible light.   Dichroic mirrors are often used as filters to remove undesired components of the light in cameras and measuring instruments.\n\nAn [[active mirror]] will produce reflected beams that have more [[power (phusics)|power]] than the incident beams. They are used to make [[disk laser]]s. The amplification is typically over a narrow range of [[wavelength]]s, and requires an external source of power.<ref name=wang2017/>\n\nIn [[X-ray optics|X-ray telescopes]], the [[X-ray]]s incide on a highly precise metal surface at almost grazing angles, and only a small fraction of the rays are reflected.<ref name=pro00/>  In [[flying relativistic mirrors]] conceived for [[X-ray laser]]s, the reflecting surface is a spherical [[shockwave]] (wake wave) created in a in a low-density [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] by a very intense laser-pulse, and moving at an extremely high velocity.<ref name=lewis2008/>\n\nA [[phase-conjugating mirror]] uses [[non-linear optics]] to reverse the phase difference between incident beams.  Such mirrors may be used, for example, for combination and self-guiding of laser beams and correction of atmospheric distortions in imaging systems.<ref name=okul1980/><ref name=okul2014/><ref name=boyd1997/>\n\n[[File:UniversumUNAM27.JPG|thumb|upright|Photographer taking picture of himself in curved mirror at the [[Universum (UNAM)|Universum museum]] in Mexico City]]\n\n==Physical principles==\nWhen a sufficiently narrow beam of light is reflected at a point of a surface, the [[surface normal|surface's normal direction]] <math>\\vec n</math> will be the bisector of the angle formed by the two beams at that point.  That is, the [[direction vector]] <math>\\vec u</math> towards the incident beams's source, the normal vector <math>\\vec n</math>, and direction vector <math>\\vec v</math> of the reflected beam will be [[coplanarity|coplanar]], and the  the angle between <math>\\vec n</math> and <math>\\vec v</math> will be equal to the  [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] between <math>\\vec n</math> and <math>\\vec u</math>, but of opposite sign.<ref name=katz2016/>  \n\nThis property can be explained by the physics of an [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic]] [[plane wave]] that  is incident to a flat surface that is [[electrical conductance|electrically conductive]] or where the [[speed of light]] changes abruptly, as between two materials with different indices of refraction. \n\n* When [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] beams of light are reflected on a plane surface, the reflected rays will be parallel too.  \n\n* If the reflecting surface is concave, the reflected beans will be [[convergence|convergent]], at least to some extent and for some distance from the surface.  \n\n* A convex mirror, on the other hand, will reflect parallel rays towards [[divergence|divergent]] diections.\n\nMore specifically, a concave parabolic mirror (whose surface is a part of a  paraboloid of revolution) will  reflect rays that are parallel to its [[axis (geometry)|axis]] into rays that pass through its [[focus (optics)|focus]].  Conversely, a parabolic concave mirror will reflect any ray that comes from its focus towards a direction parallel to its axis.  If a concave mirror surface is a part of a [[prolate ellipsoid]], it will reflect any ray coming from one focus towards the other focus.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\nA convex parabolic mirror, on the other hand, will reflect rays that are parallel to its axis into rays that seem to emanate from the focus of the surface, behind the mirror.  Conversely, it will reflect incoming rays that converge towars that point into rays parallel that are to the axis.  A convex mirror that is part of a prolate ellipsoid will reflect rays that converge towards one focus into divergent rays that seem to emanate from the other focus.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\nSpherical mirrors do not reflect parallel rays to rays that converge to or diverge from a single point, or vice-versa, due to [[spherical aberration]].   However, a spherical mirror whose diameter is sufficiently small compared to the sphere's radius will behave very similarly to a parabolic mirror whose axis goes through the mirror's center and the center of that sphere; so that spherical mirrors can substitute for parabolic ones in many applications.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\nA similar aberration occurs with parabolic mirrors when the incident rays are parallel among themselves but not parallel to the mirror's axis, or are divergent from a point that is not the focus \u2014 as when trying to form an image of an objet that is near the mirror or spans a wide angle as seen from it.  However, this aberration can be sufficiently small if the object image is sufficiently far from the mirror and spans a sufficiently small angle around its axis.<ref name=katz2016/>\n\n[[File:WW1AcousticMirrorKilnsea(PaulGlazzard)Jan2007.jpg|thumb|{{convert|4.5|m|ft|adj=on}} high acoustic mirror near [[Kilnsea]] Grange, East Yorkshire, UK]]\n[[File:Hot mirror for a camera.jpg|thumb|A hot mirror used in a camera to reduce red eye]]\n\n==Mirror images==\n[[File:Mirror statue - Gy\u0151r, 2015.10.31.JPG|thumb|A large convex mirror. Distortions in the image increase with the viewing distance.]]\n{{Main|Mirror image}}\nObjects viewed in a (plane) mirror will appear laterally inverted (e.g., if one raises one's right hand, the image's left hand will appear to go up in the mirror), but not vertically inverted (in the image a person's head still appears above their body).<ref name=lard1845/> However, a mirror does not usually \"swap\" left and right any more than it swaps top and bottom. A mirror typically reverses the forward/backward axis. To be precise, it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface (the normal). Because left and right are defined relative to front-back and top-bottom, the \"flipping\" of front and back results in the perception of a left-right reversal in the image. (If you stand side-on to a mirror, the mirror really does reverse your left and right, because that's the direction perpendicular to the mirror.)\n\nLooking at an image of oneself with the front-back axis flipped results in the perception of an image with its left-right axis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, your right hand remains directly opposite your real right hand, but it is perceived as the left hand of your image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image is actually front-back reversed, which is an effect similar to the [[hollow-mask illusion]]. Notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object.\n\nFor things that may be considered as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In the same way that text on a piece of paper appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between their legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.\n\n== Manufacturing ==\n[[File:Four mirrors - dielectric aluminum silver and chrome.jpg|thumb|Four different mirrors, showing the difference in reflectivity. Clockwise from upper left: dielectric (80%), aluminum (85%), chrome (25%), and enhanced silver (99.9%). All are first-surface mirrors except the chrome mirror.

Each layer has a different [[refractive index]], allowing each interface to produce a small amount of reflection. When the thickness of the layers is proportional to the chosen wavelength, the multiple reflections [[constructive interference|constructively interfere]]. Stacks may consist of a few to hundreds of individual coats.]]\n\nMirrors are manufactured by applying a [[silvering|reflective coating]] to a suitable [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]].<ref name=lanz2012/> The most common substrate is glass, due to its transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass on one side and the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.\n\nIn classical antiquity, mirrors were made of solid metal (bronze, later silver)<ref name=whit2013/> and were generally too expensive for use by common people, although during the [[Roman Empire]] even maid servants used widespread silver mirrors;<ref name=roma2019/> they were also prone to [[corrosion]]. Due to the low [[reflectivity]] of polished metal, these mirrors also gave a darker image than modern ones, making them unsuitable for indoor use with the artificial lighting of the time ([[candle]]s or [[lantern]]s).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe method of making mirrors out of [[flat glass|plate glass]] was invented by 13th-century Venetian glassmakers on the island of [[Murano]], who covered the back of the glass with an [[amorphous]] coat of [[tin]] using a [[Gilding#Fire-gilding|fire-gilding]] technique, obtaining near-perfect and undistorted reflection. For over one hundred years, Venetian mirrors installed in richly decorated frames served as luxury decorations for palaces throughout Europe, but the secret of the mercury process eventually arrived in London and Paris during the 17th century, due to industrial espionage. French workshops succeeded in large-scale industrialization of the process, eventually making mirrors affordable to the masses, although mercury's [[toxicity]] (a primary ingredient in gilding, which was boiled away forming noxious vapours) remained a problem.<ref name=iriw2018/>\n\nIn modern times, the mirror substrate is shaped, polished and cleaned, and is then coated. Glass mirrors are most often coated with silver<ref name=mlink2014/> or aluminium,<ref name=saun2004/> implemented by a series of coatings:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n# [[Tin(II) chloride]]\n# Silver\n# Chemical [[catalyst|activator]]\n# Copper\n# [[Paint]]\n\nThe [[tin(II) chloride]] is applied because silver will not bond with the glass. The activator causes the tin/silver to harden. Copper is added for long-term durability.<ref name=howm305/> The [[paint]] protects the coating on the back of the mirror from scratches<ref name=wats1986/> and other accidental damage.\n\nIn some applications, generally those that are cost-sensitive or that require great durability, such as for mounting in a prison cell, mirrors may be made from a single, bulk material such as polished metal. However, metals consist of small crystals (grains) separated by grain boundaries. Thus, crystalline metals do not reflect with perfect uniformity.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.2,8}} Other methods like wet-deposition or electroplating produce a non-crystalline coating of [[amorphous metal]] (metallic glass). Lacking any grain boundaries, the amorphous coatings have higher reflectivity than crystalline metals of the same type. Electroplating must be performed by first coating the glass with carbon, to make the surface electrically conductive, thus the adhesion is often not as good as with wet-deposition. Both lack the ability to produce perfectly uniform thicknesses with high precision.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.3,107}} When high precision or reflectivity is not a requirement, the coating may be placed on the back of the mirror so that the light passes through the glass, and the coating is the second surface it encounters. Therefore, these are called second-surface mirrors, which have the added benefit of high durability, because the glass substrate can protect the coating from damage.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.2,107}}\n\nFor technical applications such as [[laser]] mirrors, the reflective coating is typically applied by [[vacuum deposition]]. Vacuum deposition provides an effective means of producing a very uniform coating, and controlling the thickness with high precision.<ref name=ReferenceA/> In applications where great precision and low losses are required, the coated side of the mirror may be the first material encountered by the light, referred to as a first-surface mirror. This eliminates [[refraction]] and double reflections, also called \"ghost reflections\" (a weak reflection from the surface of the glass, and a stronger one from the reflecting metal), and reduces absorption of light by the mirror.<ref name=scha2011/> Technical mirrors may use a silver, aluminium, or gold coating (the latter typically for [[infrared]] mirrors), and achieve reflectivities of 90\u201395% when new. A hard, protective, transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent [[oxidation]] of the reflective layer and scratching of the soft metal.\n\nApplications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability, where wide [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is not essential, use [[dielectric mirror|dielectric coatings]], which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.997% over a limited range of wavelengths. Because they are often chemically stable and do not conduct electricity, dielectric coatings are almost always applied by methods of vacuum deposition, and most commonly by evaporation deposition. Because the coatings are usually transparent, absorption losses are negligible. Unlike with metals, the reflectivity of the individual dielectric-coatings is a function of [[Snell's law]] known as the [[Fresnel equations]], determined by the difference in [[refractive index]] between layers. Therefore, the thickness and index of the coatings can be adjusted to be centered on any wavelength. Vacuum deposition can be achieved in a number of ways, including sputtering, evaporation deposition, arc deposition, reactive-gas deposition, and ion plating, among many others.<ref name=pulk1999/>{{rp|p.103,107}}\n\n=== Tolerances ===\n[[File:Hubble mirror polishing.jpg|thumb|Polishing the primary mirror for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. A deviation in the surface quality of approximately 4\u03bb resulted in poor images initially, which was eventually compensated for using [[Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement|corrective optics]].]]\n[[File:Laser dielectric output coupler centered @ 550nm.png|thumb|A dielectric, laser output-coupler that is 75\u201380% reflective between 500 and 600 nm.

Because the smoke particles [[Diffraction|diffract]] more light than they reflect, the beam appears much brighter when reflecting back toward the observer.]]\n[[File:Mirror distortion and artifacts due to flatness errors.png|thumb|Flatness errors, like rippled dunes across the surface, produced these artifacts, distortion, and low image quality in the [[far field]] reflection of a household mirror.]]\n\nMirrors can be manufactured to a wide range of [[engineering tolerance]]s, including [[reflectivity]], surface quality, [[surface roughness]], or [[Transmittance|transmissivity]], depending on the desired application. These tolerances can range from low, such as found in a normal household-mirror, to extremely high, like those used in lasers or telescopes. Increasing the tolerances allows better and more precise imaging or beam transmission over longer distances. In imaging systems this can help reduce anomalies ([[Artifact (error)|artifacts]]), distortion or blur, but at a much higher cost. Where viewing distances are relatively close or high precision is not a concern, lower tolerances can be used to make effective mirrors at affordable costs.\n\n====Reflectivity====\nThe reflectivity of a mirror is determined by the percentage of reflected light per the total of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be absorbed by the coating, the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often determined by the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of the coating is sufficient to prevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum is harder, less expensive, and more resistant to tarnishing than silver, and will reflect 85 to 90% of the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but experiences a drop in its reflectance between 800 and 900&nbsp;nm. Gold is very soft and easily scratched, costly, yet does not tarnish. Gold is greater than 96% reflective to near and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000&nbsp;nm, but poorly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 600&nbsp;nm (yellow). Silver is expensive, soft, and quickly tarnishes, but has the highest reflectivity in the visual to near-infrared of any metal. Silver can reflect up to 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long as 2000&nbsp;nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350&nbsp;nm. Dielectric mirrors can reflect greater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths, ranging from a bandwidth of only 10&nbsp;nm to as wide as 100&nbsp;nm for [[tunable laser]]s. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them from scratching or tarnishing. Dielectric materials are typically very hard and relatively cheap, however the number of coats needed generally makes it an expensive process. In mirrors with low tolerances, the coating thickness may be reduced to save cost, and simply covered with paint to absorb transmission.<ref name=ReferenceB/>\n\n====Surface quality====\nSurface quality, or surface accuracy, measures the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface shape. Increasing the surface quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and [[Aberration (optics)|aberration]] in images, and helps increase [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]], [[collimation]], and reduce unwanted [[beam divergence|divergence]] in beams. For plane mirrors, this is often described in terms of [[Flatness (manufacturing)|flatness]], while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The surface quality is typically measured with items like [[interferometer]]s or [[optical flat]]s, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (\u03bb). These deviations can be much larger or much smaller than the surface roughness. A normal household-mirror made with [[float glass]] may have flatness tolerances as low as 9\u201314\u03bb per inch (25.4&nbsp;mm), equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 [[nanometer]]s from perfect flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as \u03bb/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12&nbsp;nm) across the entire surface.<ref name=cheng2009/><ref name=ReferenceB/> The surface quality can be affected by factors such as temperature changes, internal stress in the substrate, or even bending effects that occur when combining materials with different coefficients of [[thermal expansion]], similar to a [[bimetallic strip]].<ref name=leon2006/>\n\n====Surface roughness====\n[[Surface roughness]] describes the texture of the surface, often in terms of the depth of the microscopic scratches left by the polishing operations. Surface roughness determines how much of the reflection is specular and how much diffuses, controlling how sharp or blurry the image will be.\n\nFor perfectly specular reflection, the surface roughness must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater than an inch (~25&nbsp;mm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, continental ice-sheets, or desert sand, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few hundred-thousandths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce specular reflection. For wavelengths that are approaching or are even shorter than the [[Atomic radius|diameter of the atoms]], such as [[X-ray]]s, specular reflection can only be produced by surfaces that are at a [[grazing incidence]] from the rays.\n\nSurface roughness is typically measured in [[micron]]s, wavelength, or [[Sandpaper#Grit size table|grit size]], with ~80,000\u2013100,000&nbsp;grit or ~\u00bd\u03bb\u2013\u00bc\u03bb being \"optical quality\".<ref name=duzg2011/><ref name=ReferenceB/><ref name=warn/>\n\n====Transmissivity====\nTransmissivity is determined by the percentage of light transmitted per the incident light. Transmissivity is usually the same from both first and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For transmissive mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, [[beam splitter]]s, or laser [[output coupler]]s, the transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the transmissivity. For the substrate, the material used must also have good transmissivity to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as [[zinc selenide]] or [[synthetic sapphire]] may be used for infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.<ref name=greav1989/>{{rp|p.104\u2013108}}\n\n====Wedge====\nWedge errors are caused by the deviation of the surfaces from perfect parallelism. An [[optical wedge]] is the angle formed between two plane-surfaces (or between the principle planes of curved surfaces) due to manufacturing errors or limitations, causing one edge of the mirror to be slightly thicker than the other. Nearly all mirrors and optics with parallel faces have some slight degree of wedge, which is usually measured in [[second of arc|seconds]] or [[minutes of arc]]. For first-surface mirrors, wedges can introduce alignment deviations in mounting hardware. For second-surface or transmissive mirrors, wedges can have a prismatic effect on the light, deviating its trajectory or, to a very slight degree, its color, causing [[chromatic aberration|chromatic]] and other forms of [[Optical aberration|aberration]]. In some instances, a slight wedge is desirable, such as in certain laser systems where stray reflections from the uncoated surface are better dispersed than reflected back through the medium.<ref name=walk1998/><ref name=klei1989/>\n\n====Surface defects====\nSurface defects are small-scale, discontinuous imperfections in the surface smoothness. Surface defects are larger (in some cases much larger) than the surface roughness, but only affect small, localized portions of the entire surface. These are typically found as scratches, digs, pits (often from bubbles in the glass), sleeks (scratches from prior, larger grit polishing operations that were not fully removed by subsequent polishing grits), edge chips, or blemishes in the coating. These defects are often an unavoidable side-effect of manufacturing limitations, both in cost and machine precision. If kept low enough, in most applications these defects will rarely have any adverse effect, unless the surface is located at an image plane where they will show up directly. For applications that require extremely low scattering of light, extremely high reflectance, or low absorption due to high energy-levels that could destroy the mirror, such as lasers or [[Fabry-Perot interferometer]]s, the surface defects must be kept to a minimum.<ref name=azop2016/>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Jekyll.and.Hyde.Ch10.Drawing2.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''cheval glass'']]\n[[File:mirror.globe.arp.500pix.jpg|thumb|upright|Reflections in a spherical convex mirror.

A classic example of the latter is the [[wikt:cheval glass#English|cheval glass]], which may be tilted.\n\n=== Safety and easier viewing ===\n;Convex mirrors\n:Convex mirrors provide a wider [[field of view]] than flat mirrors,<ref name=king2000/> and are often used on vehicles,<ref name=ushw1979/> especially large trucks, to minimize [[Blind spot (automobile)|blind spots]]. They are sometimes placed at [[road junction]]s, and corners of sites such as [[parking lot]]s to allow people to see around corners to avoid crashing into other vehicles or [[shopping cart]]s. They are also sometimes used as part of security systems, so that a single [[video camera]] can show more than one [[angle]] at a time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Convex mirrors as decoration are used in interior design to provide a predominantly experiential effect.<ref name=charm2016/>\n\n;[[Mouth mirror]]s or \"dental mirrors\"\n:Mouth mirrors or \"dental mirrors\" are used by dentists to allow indirect vision and lighting within the mouth. Their reflective surfaces may be either flat or curved.<ref name=ande2000/> Mouth mirrors are also commonly used by [[mechanic]]s to allow vision in tight spaces and around corners in equipment.\n;[[Rear-view mirror]]s\n:Rear-view mirrors are widely used in and on vehicles (such as automobiles, or bicycles), to allow drivers to see other vehicles coming up behind them.<ref name=kali/>  On rear-view sunglasses, the left end of the left glass and the right end of the right glass work as mirrors.\n\n=== One-way mirrors and windows ===\n{{Main|One-way mirror}}\n;One-way mirrors\n:One-way mirrors  (also called two-way mirrors) work by overwhelming dim transmitted light with bright reflected light.<ref name=twow2012/> A true one-way mirror that actually allows light to be transmitted in one direction only without requiring external energy is not possible as it violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].{{Citation needed|reason=A common sense explanation is not sufficient. A source that discusses this more in depth is needed.|date=November 2015}}:\n;One-way windows\n:One-way windows can be made to work with polarized light in the laboratory without violating the second law. This is an apparent paradox that stumped some great physicists, although it does not allow a practical one-way mirror for use in the real world.<ref name=mung1999/><ref name=rayle1901/> [[Faraday isolator|Optical isolators]] are one-way devices that are commonly used with lasers.\n\n=== Signalling ===\n{{Main|Heliograph}}\nWith the sun as light source, a mirror can be used to signal by variations in the orientation of the mirror. The signal can be used over long distances, possibly up to {{convert|60|km}} on a clear day. This technique was used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and numerous [[military|militaries]] to transmit information between distant outposts.\n\nMirrors can also be used for search to attract the attention of [[search and rescue]] parties. Specialized type of mirrors are available and are often included in military [[survival kit]]s.\n\n=== Technology ===\n\n==== Televisions and projectors ====\n\nMicroscopic mirrors are a core element of many of the largest [[HDTV|high-definition]] televisions and [[video projector]]s. A common technology of this type is [[Texas Instruments]]' [[digital light processing|DLP]]. A DLP chip is a postage stamp-sized microchip whose surface is an array of millions of microscopic mirrors. The picture is created as the individual mirrors move to either reflect light toward the projection surface ([[pixel]] on), or toward a light absorbing surface (pixel off).\n\nOther projection technologies involving mirrors include [[LCoS]]. Like a DLP chip, LCoS is a microchip of similar size, but rather than millions of individual mirrors, there is a single mirror that is actively shielded by a [[liquid crystal]] matrix with up to millions of [[pixels]]. The picture, formed as light, is either reflected toward the projection surface (pixel on), or absorbed by the activated [[LCD]] pixels (pixel off). LCoS-based televisions and projectors often use 3 chips, one for each primary color.\n\nLarge mirrors are used in rear projection televisions. Light (for example from a DLP as mentioned above) is \"folded\" by one or more mirrors so that the television set is compact.\n\n==== Solar power ====\n[[File:Parabolic trough near Harper Lake in California front and back.jpg|thumb|Parabolic troughs near [[Harper Lake]] in [[California]]]]\nMirrors are integral parts of a [[solar power]] plant. The one shown in the adjacent picture uses [[concentrated solar power]] from an array of [[parabolic trough]]s.<ref name=pale2015/>\n\n==== Instruments ====\n{{See also|Mirror support cell}}\n[[File:E-ELT mirror segments under test.jpg|thumb|[[E-ELT]] mirror segments under test]]\n[[Telescope]]s and other precision instruments use ''front silvered'' or [[first surface mirrors]], where the reflecting surface is placed on the front (or first) surface of the glass (this eliminates reflection from glass surface ordinary back mirrors have). Some of them use silver, but most are aluminium, which is more reflective at short wavelengths than silver.\nAll of these coatings are easily damaged and require special handling.\nThey reflect 90% to 95% of the incident light when new.\nThe coatings are typically applied by [[vacuum deposition]].\nA protective overcoat is usually applied before the mirror is removed from the vacuum, because the coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air. ''Front silvered'' mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality. There are optical mirrors such as [[mangin mirror]]s that are ''second surface mirrors'' (reflective coating on the rear surface) as part of their optical designs, usually to correct [[optical aberration]]s.<ref name=boba2014/>\n\n[[File:Super-thin Mirror Under Test at ESO.jpg|thumb|left|Deformable thin-shell mirror. It is 1120 millimetres across but just 2 millimetres thick, making it much thinner than most glass windows.<ref name=eso2013/>]]\n\nThe reflectivity of the mirror coating can be measured using a [[Spectrophotometer|reflectometer]] and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some [[optical]] work to make [[cold mirror]]s and [[hot mirror]]s. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to [[infrared]] light.\n\nA hot mirror is the opposite, the coating preferentially reflects infrared. Mirror surfaces are sometimes given thin film overcoatings both to retard degradation of the surface and to increase their reflectivity in parts of the spectrum where they will be used. For instance, aluminum mirrors are commonly coated with silicon dioxide or magnesium fluoride. The reflectivity as a function of wavelength depends on both the thickness of the coating and on how it is applied.\n\n[[File:Dielectric laser mirror from a dye laser.JPG|thumb|A dielectric coated mirror used in a [[dye laser]]. The mirror is over 99% reflective at 550 [[nanometer]]s, (yellow), but will allow most other colors to pass through.]]\n[[File:Laserr mirror from a dye laser for use with rhodamine.jpg|thumb|A dielectric mirror used in [[tunable laser]]s. With a center wavelength of 600 nm and bandwidth of 100 nm, the coating is totally reflective to the orange construction paper, but only reflects the reddish hues from the blue paper.]]\nFor scientific [[optics|optical]] work, [[dielectric mirror]]s are often used. These are glass (or sometimes other material) substrates on which one or more layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified. The best mirrors of this type can reflect &gt;99.999% of the light (in a narrow range of wavelengths) which is incident on the mirror. Such mirrors are often used in [[laser]]s.\n\nIn astronomy, [[adaptive optics]] is a technique to measure variable image distortions and adapt a [[deformable mirror]] accordingly on a timescale of milliseconds, to compensate for the distortions.\n\nAlthough most mirrors are designed to reflect visible light, surfaces reflecting other forms of electromagnetic radiation are also called \"mirrors\". The mirrors for other ranges of [[electromagnetic waves]] are used in\noptics and [[astronomy]]. Mirrors for radio waves (sometimes known as reflectors) are important elements of [[radio telescope]]s.\n\n==== Face-to-face mirrors ====\nTwo or more mirrors aligned exactly parallel and facing each other can give an infinite regress of reflections, called an [[infinity mirror]] effect. Some devices use this to generate multiple reflections:\n* [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer]]\n* [[Laser]] (which contains an [[optical cavity]])\n* 3D [[Kaleidoscope]] to concentrate light<ref name=more2010/>\n* momentum-enhanced [[solar sail]]<ref name=meyer1987/>\n\n==== Military applications ====\nIt has been said that [[Archimedes]] used a large array of mirrors to burn [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ships during an attack on Syracuse. This has never been proven or disproved. On the TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'', a team from [[MIT]] tried to recreate the famous \"Archimedes Death Ray\". They were unsuccessful at starting a fire on the ship.<ref name=myth2019/> Previous attempts to light the boat on fire using only the bronze mirrors available in Archimedes' time were unsuccessful, and the time taken to ignite the craft would have made its use impractical, resulting in the ''MythBusters'' team deeming the myth \"busted\". It was however found that the mirrors made it very difficult for the passengers of the targeted boat to see, likely helping to cause their defeat, which may have been the origin of the myth. (See [[solar power tower]] for a practical use of this technique.)\n\n==== Seasonal lighting ====\n[[File:Kibble Palace Mirror.JPG|left|thumb|A multi-facet mirror in the [[Kibble Palace]] conservatory, [[Glasgow]], Scotland]]\n\n<!-- If this technique becomes popular, don't let this section grow into a vast list of examples. -->\nDue to its location in a steep-sided valley, the Italian town of [[Viganella]] gets no direct sunlight for seven weeks each winter. In 2006 a \u20ac100,000 computer-controlled mirror, 8\u00d75&nbsp;m, was installed to reflect sunlight into the town's piazza. In early 2007 the similarly situated village of [[Bondo, Switzerland]], was considering applying this solution as well.<ref name=bbcn2007/><ref name=apsw207/> In 2013, mirrors were installed to reflect sunlight into the town square in the Norwegian town of [[Rjukan]].<ref name=bbcn2013/> Mirrors can be used to produce enhanced lighting effects in greenhouses or conservatories.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Mirrored building in Manhattan, 2008.tif|thumb|Mirrored building in Manhattan - 2008]]\n[[File:Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago, Illinois, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-20, DD 05.jpg|thumb|[[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] reflects the skyline along the [[Chicago River]] in downtown Chicago]]\n{{See also|Architectural glass}}\nMirrors are a popular design theme in architecture, particularly with [[Modern architecture|late modern]] and [[Post-modern architecture|post-modernist]] high-rise buildings in major cities. Early examples include the Campbell Center in [[Dallas]], which opened in 1972,<ref name=brown2012/> and the [[John Hancock Tower]] in Boston.\n\nMore recently, two skyscrapers designed by architect [[Rafael Vi\u00f1oly]], the [[Vdara]] in Las Vegas and [[20 Fenchurch Street]] in London, have experienced unusual problems due to their concave curved glass exteriors acting as respectively cylindrical and spherical reflectors for sunlight.  In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflected off the Vdara's south-facing tower could singe swimmers in the hotel pool, as well as melting plastic cups and shopping bags; employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the \"Vdara death ray\",<ref name=vdara2010/> aka the \"[[fryscraper]].\" In 2013, sunlight reflecting off 20 Fenchurch Street melted parts of a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar car]] parked nearby and scorching or igniting the carpet of a nearby barber shop.<ref name=fench2013/>  This building had been nicknamed the \"walkie-talkie\" because its shape was supposedly similar to a certain model of two-way radio; but after its tendency to overheat surrounding objects became known, the nickname changed to the \"walkie-scorchie.\"\n\n=== Fine art ===\n\n==== Paintings ====\n[[File:Titian - Venus with a Mirror - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus with a Mirror]]'']]\nPainters depicting someone gazing into a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This is a kind of abstraction\u2014in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and [[Photography|still photography]] an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself in the mirror, and yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection. In the psychology of perception, this is known as the [[Venus effect]].\n\nThe mirror is the central device in some of the greatest of European paintings:\n* [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re]]''\n* [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus effect|Venus with a Mirror]]''\n* [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''\n* [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[List of Picasso artworks 1931\u20131940|Girl before a Mirror]]'' (1932)\n* [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s ''[[Rokeby Venus]]''\n* [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s ''[[Las Meninas]]'', wherein the viewer is both the watcher (of a self-portrait in progress) and the watched, and the many adaptations of that painting in various media\n* [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]'s ''Venus with a Mirror''\n\nMirrors have been used by artists to create works and hone their craft:\n* [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] discovered linear perspective with the help of the mirror.<ref name=camp2014/>\n* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] called the mirror the \"master of painters\". He recommended, \"When you wish to see whether your whole picture accords with what you have portrayed from nature take a mirror and reflect the actual object in it. Compare what is reflected with your painting and carefully consider whether both likenesses of the subject correspond, particularly in regard to the mirror.\"<ref name=mccur1938/>\n* Many [[self-portraits]] are made possible through the use of mirrors, such as the great self-portraits by [[D\u00fcrer]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Van Gogh]]. [[M. C. Escher]] used special shapes of mirrors in order to achieve a much more complete view of his surroundings than by direct observation in ''[[Hand with Reflecting Sphere]]'' (also known as ''Self-Portrait in Spherical Mirror'').\n\nMirrors are sometimes necessary to fully appreciate art work:\n* [[Istv\u00e1n Orosz]]'s [[anamorphosis|anamorphic]] works are images distorted such that they only become clearly visible when reflected in a suitably shaped and positioned mirror.<ref name=orosz2015/>\n\n==== Sculpture ====\n[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943) Sala d'aspetto per la casa di M.me B.,1939.jpg|thumb|Mirrors in interior design:\n\"Waiting room in the house of M.me B.\", [[Art Deco]] project by Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], Rome, 1939.]]\n* [[Anamorphosis]] projecting sculpture into mirrors\nContemporary anamorphic artist [[Jonty Hurwitz]] uses [[cylindrical]] mirrors to project distorted sculptures.<ref name=hurw2013/>\n* Sculptures comprised entirely or in part of mirrors\n** ''[[:File:Infinity wulsin.jpg|Infinity Also Hurts]]'' is a mirror, glass and [[silicone]] sculpture by artist, [[Seth Wulsin]]\n** ''[[Sky Mirror]]'' is a [[public art|public sculpture]] by artist, [[Anish Kapoor]]\n\n==== Other artistic mediums ====\n[[File:130 - Grove Of Mirrors, Hilary Arnold Baker (4655892606).jpg|thumb|''Grove Of Mirrors'' by [[Hilary Arnold Baker]], [[Romsey]]]]\n\nSome other contemporary artists use mirrors as the [[List of artistic mediums|material of art]]:\n* A [[Chinese magic mirror]] is an art in which the face of the bronze mirror projects the same image that was cast on its back. This is due to minute curvatures on its front.<ref name=unesco-courrier/>\n* [[Specular holography]] uses a large number of curved mirrors embedded in a surface to produce three-dimensional imagery.\n* Paintings on mirror surfaces (such as silkscreen printed glass mirrors)\n* Special mirror installations\n** ''Follow Me'' mirror labyrinth by artist, [[Jeppe Hein]] (see also, Entertainment: Mirror mazes, below)\n** ''Mirror Neon Cube'' by artist, Jeppe Hein\n\n==== Religious Function of the real and depicted mirror ====\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] mirrors existed in various shapes for multiple uses. Mostly they were used as an accessory for personal hygiene but also as tokens of courtly love, made from [[Ivory carving|ivory]] in the ivory carving centers in Paris, Cologne and the Southern Netherlands.<ref name=court2018/> They also had their uses in religious contexts as they were integrated in a special form of [[Pilgrim badge|pilgrims badges]] or pewter/lead mirror boxes<ref name=bojm2018/> since the late 14th century. Burgundian ducal inventories show us that the dukes owned a mass of mirrors or objects with mirrors, not only with religious iconography or inscriptions, but combined with reliquaries, religious paintings or other objects that were distinctively used for personal piety.<ref name=sche2013/> Considering mirrors in paintings and book illumination as depicted artifacts and trying to draw conclusions about their functions from their depicted setting, one of these functions is to be an aid in personal prayer to achieve self-knowledge and knowledge of God, in accord with contemporary theological sources. E.g. the famous [[Arnolfini Portrait|Arnolfini]]-Wedding by [[Jan van Eyck]] shows a constellation of objects that can be recognized as one which would allow a praying man to use them for his personal piety: the mirror surrounded by scenes of the Passion to reflect on it and on oneself, a [[rosary]] as a device in this process, the veiled and cushioned bench to use as a [[prie-dieu]], and the abandoned shoes that point in the direction in which the praying man kneeled.<ref name=sche2013/> The metaphorical meaning of depicted mirrors is complex and many-layered, e.g. as an attribute of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], the \u201cspeculum sine macula\u201d, or as attributes of scholarly and theological wisdom and knowledge as they appear in book illuminations of different [[Four Evangelists|evangelists]] and authors of theological treatises. Depicted mirrors \u2013 orientated on the physical properties of a real mirror \u2013 can be seen as metaphors of knowledge and reflection and are thus able to remind the beholder to reflect and get to know himself. The mirror may function simultaneously as a symbol and a device of a moral appeal. That is also the case if it is shown in combination with virtues and vices, a combination which also occurs more frequently in the 15th century: The moralizing layers of mirror metaphors remind the beholder to examine himself thoroughly according to his own virtuous or vicious life. This is all the more true if the mirror is combined with iconography of death. Not only is Death as a corpse or skeleton holding the mirror for the still living personnel of paintings, illuminations and prints, but the skull appears on the convex surfaces of depicted mirrors, showing the painted and real beholder his future face.<ref name=sche2013/>\n\n=== Decoration ===\n[[File:Overmantel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fireplace mantel|Chimneypiece]] and overmantel mirror, c. 1750 V&A Museum no. 738:1 to 3\u20131897]]\n[[File:Demo Day 2016 - Design Center (19).jpg|thumb|Glasses with mirrors \u2013 Prezi HQ]]\n[[File:Dunville's Whisky Pub Mirror 01.jpeg|thumb|A bar mirror bearing the logo of [[Dunville & Co#Dunville's Whisky|Dunville's Whiskey]].]]\nMirrors are frequently used in [[interior decoration]] and as ornaments:\n* Mirrors, typically large and unframed, are frequently used in [[interior decoration]] to create an illusion of space and amplify the apparent size of a room.<ref name=alic2016/> They come also framed in a variety of forms, such as the [[pier glass]] and the overmantel mirror.\n* Mirrors are used also in some schools of [[feng shui]], an ancient [[Culture of China|Chinese]] practice of placement and arrangement of space to achieve harmony with the environment.\n* The softness of old mirrors is sometimes replicated by contemporary artisans for use in [[interior design]].
