In the latter cases, a transition period is often necessary to decide on the direction taken.\n\nOther types of revolution, created for other typologies, include the [[social revolution]]s; [[proletarian revolution|proletarian]] or [[communist revolution]]s (inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aims to replace [[capitalism]] with [[Communism]]); failed or abortive revolutions (revolutions that fail to secure power after temporary victories or large-scale mobilization); or violent vs. [[nonviolent revolution]]s.\n\nThe term ''revolution'' has also been used to denote great changes outside the political sphere.

Among the leading scholars in that area have been or are [[Crane Brinton]], [[Charles Brockett]], [[Farideh Farhi]], [[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], [[John Mason Hart]], [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ted Roberts Gurr]], [[Fred Halliday]], [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Tim McDaniel]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffery Paige]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Terence Ranger]], [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[James C.

Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.5</ref>\n\nScholars of revolutions, like [[Jack Goldstone]], differentiate four current 'generations' of scholarly research dealing with revolutions.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/> The scholars of the first generation such as [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Charles A. Ellwood]], or [[Pitirim Sorokin]], were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions was usually related to [[social psychology]], such as Le Bon's [[crowd psychology]] theory.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nSecond generation theorists sought to develop detailed theories of why and when revolutions arise, grounded in more complex [[social behavior]] theories. They can be divided into three major approaches: psychological, sociological and political.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nThe works of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], [[Ivo K. Feierbrand]], [[Rosalind L. Feierbrand]], [[James A. Geschwender]], [[David C. Schwartz]], and [[Denton E. Morrison]] fall into the first category. They followed theories of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[frustration-aggression theory]] and saw the cause of revolution in the state of mind of the masses, and while they varied in their approach as to what exactly caused the people to revolt (e.g., modernization, recession, or discrimination), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was the widespread frustration with socio-political situation.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nThe second group, composed of academics such as [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Neil Smelser]], [[Bob Jessop]], [[Mark Hart]], [[Edward A. Tiryakian]], and [[Mark Hagopian]], followed in the footsteps of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the [[structural-functionalist]] theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nFinally, the third group, which included writers such as [[Charles Tilly]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Peter Ammann]], and [[Arthur L. Stinchcombe]] followed the path of [[political sciences]] and looked at [[pluralist theory]] and [[interest group conflict theory]]. Those theories see events as outcomes of a [[power struggle]] between competing [[advocacy group|interest groups]]. In such a model, revolutions happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within a normal [[decision making]] process traditional for a given [[political system]], and simultaneously have enough resources to employ force in pursuing their goals.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nThe second generation theorists saw the development of the revolutions as a two-step process; first, some change results in the present situation being different from the past; second, the new situation creates an opportunity for a revolution to occur. In that situation, an event that in the past would not be sufficient to cause a revolution (e.g., a war, a riot, a bad harvest), now is sufficient; however, if authorities are aware of the danger, they can still prevent a revolution through reform or repression.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\nMany such early studies of revolutions tended to concentrate on four classic cases: famous and uncontroversial examples that fit virtually all definitions of revolutions, such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799), the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Revolution (also known as the Chinese Civil War)]] (1927\u20131949).<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/> In his ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', however, the Harvard historian [[Crane Brinton]] focused on the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution.<ref>Crane Brinton, ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', revised ed. (New York, Vintage Books, 1965). First edition, 1938.</ref>\n\nIn time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolutions (see [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]), and differences in definitions and approaches gave rise to new definitions and explanations. The theories of the second generation have been criticized for their limited geographical scope, difficulty in empirical verification, as well as that while they may explain some particular revolutions, they did not explain why revolutions did not occur in other societies in very similar situations.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\nThe criticism of the second generation led to the rise of a third generation of theories, with writers such as [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffrey Paige]], and others expanding on the old [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class conflict]] approach, turning their attention to rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous elites, and the impact of interstate economic and military competition on domestic political change Particularly Skocpol's ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]'' became one of the most widely recognized works of the third generation; Skocpol defined revolution as \"rapid, basic transformations of society's state and class structures [...] accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below\", attributing revolutions to a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\n[[File:West and East Germans at the Brandenburg Gate in 1989.jpg|thumb|left|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and most of the events of the [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful.]]\nFrom the late 1980s a new body of scholarly work began questioning the dominance of the third generation's theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by new revolutionary events that could not be easily explain by them. The [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian]] and [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]s of 1979, the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] and the 1989 [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe saw multi-class coalitions topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and [[General strike|mass strikes]] in [[nonviolent revolution]]s.\n\nDefining revolutions as mostly European violent state versus people and [[class struggle]]s conflicts was no longer sufficient. The study of revolutions thus evolved in three directions, firstly, some researchers were applying previous or updated [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories of revolutions to events beyond the previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts. Secondly, scholars called for greater attention to conscious [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in the form of ideology and culture in shaping revolutionary mobilization and objectives. Third, analysts of both revolutions and social movements realized that those phenomena have much in common, and a new 'fourth generation' literature on contentious politics has developed that attempts to combine insights from the study of social movements and revolutions in hopes of understanding both phenomena.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\nFurther, social science research on revolution, primarily work in political science, has begun to move beyond individual or comparative case studies towards large-N empirical studies assessing the causes and implications of revolution. Initial studies generally rely on the Polity Project\u2019s data on [[democratization]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = PolityProject|url = http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html|website = www.systemicpeace.org|access-date = 2016-02-17}}</ref> Such analyses, like those by Enterline,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Regime Changes, Neighborhoods, and Interstate Conflict, 1816-1992|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 804\u2013829|volume = 42|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/0022002798042006006|language = en|first = A.

More recently, scholars like Jeff Colgan have argued that Polity, which measures the degree of democratic or autocratic authority in a state's governing institutions based on the openness of executive recruitment, constraints on executive authority, and political competition, is inadequate because it measures democratization, not revolution, and fails to account for regimes which come to power by revolution but fail to change the structure of the state and society sufficiently to yield a notable difference in Polity score.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Revolution|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 444\u2013467|volume = 29|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0738894212449093|language = en|first = Jeff|last = Colgan}}</ref> Instead, Colgan offers a new data set on revolutionary leaders which identifies governments that \"transform the existing social, political, and economic relationships of the state by overthrowing or rejecting the principal existing institutions of society.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Data - Jeff D Colgan|url = https://sites.google.com/site/jeffdcolgan/data|website = sites.google.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}</ref> This most recent data set has been employed to make empirically-based contributions to the literature on revolution by identifying links between revolution and the likelihood of international disputes.\n\nRevolutions have also been approached from anthropological perspectives. Drawing on Victor Turner\u2019s writings on ritual and performance, [[Bjorn Thomassen]] has argued that revolutions can be understood as \"liminal\" moments: modern political revolutions very much resemble rituals and can therefore be studied within a process approach.<ref name=\"Thomassen\" /> This would imply not only a focus on political behavior \"from below\", but also to recognize moments where \"high and low\" are relativized, made irrelevant or subverted, and where the micro and macro levels fuse together in critical conjunctions.\n\nEconomist [[Douglass North]] argued that it is much easier for revolutionaries to alter formal political institutions such as laws and constitutions than to alter informal social conventions. According to North, inconsistencies between rapidly changing formal institutions and slow-changing informal ones can inhibit effective sociopolitical change. Because of this, the long-term effect of revolutionary political restructuring is often more moderate than the ostensible short-term effect.<ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Douglass C|title=Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|date=1992|publisher=ICS Press|location=San Francisco|page=13}}</ref>\n\nWhile revolutions encompass events ranging from [[Revolutions of 1989|the relatively peaceful revolutions that overthrew communist regimes]] to the [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan]], they exclude ''coups d'\u00e9tat'', civil wars, revolts, and rebellions that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority (such as [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 or the [[American Civil War]]), as well as peaceful transitions to [[democracy]] through institutional arrangements such as [[plebiscite]]s and [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]], as in [[Spain]] after the death of [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Social movement|Social Movements]]\n* [[Age of Revolution]]\n* [[Classless society]]\n* [[Passive revolution]]\n* [[Political warfare]]\n* [[Psychological warfare]]\n* [[Rebellion]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary wave]]\n* [[Right of revolution]]\n* [[Subversion]]\n* [[User revolt]] - A phenomenon related to the modern [[Internet]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Lists of revolutions===\n* [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]\n* [[List of fictional revolutions and coups]]\n* [[List of uprisings led by women]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Popovic, Srdja.

Among the leading scholars in that area have been or are [[Crane Brinton]], [[Charles Brockett]], [[Farideh Farhi]], [[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], [[John Mason Hart]], [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ted Roberts Gurr]], [[Fred Halliday]], [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Tim McDaniel]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffery Paige]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Terence Ranger]], [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[James C.

Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.5</ref>\n\nScholars of revolutions, like [[Jack Goldstone]], differentiate four current 'generations' of scholarly research dealing with revolutions.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/> The scholars of the first generation such as [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Charles A. Ellwood]], or [[Pitirim Sorokin]], were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions was usually related to [[social psychology]], such as Le Bon's [[crowd psychology]] theory.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nSecond generation theorists sought to develop detailed theories of why and when revolutions arise, grounded in more complex [[social behavior]] theories. They can be divided into three major approaches: psychological, sociological and political.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nThe works of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], [[Ivo K. Feierbrand]], [[Rosalind L. Feierbrand]], [[James A. Geschwender]], [[David C. Schwartz]], and [[Denton E. Morrison]] fall into the first category. They followed theories of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[frustration-aggression theory]] and saw the cause of revolution in the state of mind of the masses, and while they varied in their approach as to what exactly caused the people to revolt (e.g., modernization, recession, or discrimination), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was the widespread frustration with socio-political situation.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nThe second group, composed of academics such as [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Neil Smelser]], [[Bob Jessop]], [[Mark Hart]], [[Edward A. Tiryakian]], and [[Mark Hagopian]], followed in the footsteps of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the [[structural-functionalist]] theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nFinally, the third group, which included writers such as [[Charles Tilly]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Peter Ammann]], and [[Arthur L. Stinchcombe]] followed the path of [[political sciences]] and looked at [[pluralist theory]] and [[interest group conflict theory]]. Those theories see events as outcomes of a [[power struggle]] between competing [[advocacy group|interest groups]]. In such a model, revolutions happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within a normal [[decision making]] process traditional for a given [[political system]], and simultaneously have enough resources to employ force in pursuing their goals.<ref name=\"Goldstonet3\"/>\n\nThe second generation theorists saw the development of the revolutions as a two-step process; first, some change results in the present situation being different from the past; second, the new situation creates an opportunity for a revolution to occur. In that situation, an event that in the past would not be sufficient to cause a revolution (e.g., a war, a riot, a bad harvest), now is sufficient; however, if authorities are aware of the danger, they can still prevent a revolution through reform or repression.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\nMany such early studies of revolutions tended to concentrate on four classic cases: famous and uncontroversial examples that fit virtually all definitions of revolutions, such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799), the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Revolution (also known as the Chinese Civil War)]] (1927\u20131949).<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/> In his ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', however, the Harvard historian [[Crane Brinton]] focused on the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution.<ref>Crane Brinton, ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', revised ed. (New York, Vintage Books, 1965). First edition, 1938.</ref>\n\nIn time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolutions (see [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]), and differences in definitions and approaches gave rise to new definitions and explanations. The theories of the second generation have been criticized for their limited geographical scope, difficulty in empirical verification, as well as that while they may explain some particular revolutions, they did not explain why revolutions did not occur in other societies in very similar situations.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\nThe criticism of the second generation led to the rise of a third generation of theories, with writers such as [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffrey Paige]], and others expanding on the old [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class conflict]] approach, turning their attention to rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous elites, and the impact of interstate economic and military competition on domestic political change Particularly Skocpol's ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]'' became one of the most widely recognized works of the third generation; Skocpol defined revolution as \"rapid, basic transformations of society's state and class structures [...] accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below\", attributing revolutions to a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\n[[File:West and East Germans at the Brandenburg Gate in 1989.jpg|thumb|left|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and most of the events of the [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful.]]\nFrom the late 1980s a new body of scholarly work began questioning the dominance of the third generation's theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by new revolutionary events that could not be easily explain by them. The [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian]] and [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]s of 1979, the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] and the 1989 [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe saw multi-class coalitions topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and [[General strike|mass strikes]] in [[nonviolent revolution]]s.\n\nDefining revolutions as mostly European violent state versus people and [[class struggle]]s conflicts was no longer sufficient. The study of revolutions thus evolved in three directions, firstly, some researchers were applying previous or updated [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories of revolutions to events beyond the previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts. Secondly, scholars called for greater attention to conscious [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in the form of ideology and culture in shaping revolutionary mobilization and objectives. Third, analysts of both revolutions and social movements realized that those phenomena have much in common, and a new 'fourth generation' literature on contentious politics has developed that attempts to combine insights from the study of social movements and revolutions in hopes of understanding both phenomena.<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\nFurther, social science research on revolution, primarily work in political science, has begun to move beyond individual or comparative case studies towards large-N empirical studies assessing the causes and implications of revolution. Initial studies generally rely on the Polity Project\u2019s data on [[democratization]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = PolityProject|url = http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html|website = www.systemicpeace.org|access-date = 2016-02-17}}</ref> Such analyses, like those by Enterline,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Regime Changes, Neighborhoods, and Interstate Conflict, 1816-1992|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 804\u2013829|volume = 42|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/0022002798042006006|language = en|first = A.

More recently, scholars like Jeff Colgan have argued that Polity, which measures the degree of democratic or autocratic authority in a state's governing institutions based on the openness of executive recruitment, constraints on executive authority, and political competition, is inadequate because it measures democratization, not revolution, and fails to account for regimes which come to power by revolution but fail to change the structure of the state and society sufficiently to yield a notable difference in Polity score.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Revolution|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 444\u2013467|volume = 29|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0738894212449093|language = en|first = Jeff|last = Colgan}}</ref> Instead, Colgan offers a new data set on revolutionary leaders which identifies governments that \"transform the existing social, political, and economic relationships of the state by overthrowing or rejecting the principal existing institutions of society.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Data - Jeff D Colgan|url = https://sites.google.com/site/jeffdcolgan/data|website = sites.google.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}</ref> This most recent data set has been employed to make empirically-based contributions to the literature on revolution by identifying links between revolution and the likelihood of international disputes.\n\nRevolutions have also been approached from anthropological perspectives. Drawing on Victor Turner\u2019s writings on ritual and performance, [[Bjorn Thomassen]] has argued that revolutions can be understood as \"liminal\" moments: modern political revolutions very much resemble rituals and can therefore be studied within a process approach.<ref name=\"Thomassen\" /> This would imply not only a focus on political behavior \"from below\", but also to recognize moments where \"high and low\" are relativized, made irrelevant or subverted, and where the micro and macro levels fuse together in critical conjunctions.\n\nEconomist [[Douglass North]] argued that it is much easier for revolutionaries to alter formal political institutions such as laws and constitutions than to alter informal social conventions. According to North, inconsistencies between rapidly changing formal institutions and slow-changing informal ones can inhibit effective sociopolitical change. Because of this, the long-term effect of revolutionary political restructuring is often more moderate than the ostensible short-term effect.<ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Douglass C|title=Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|date=1992|publisher=ICS Press|location=San Francisco|page=13}}</ref>\n\nWhile revolutions encompass events ranging from [[Revolutions of 1989|the relatively peaceful revolutions that overthrew communist regimes]] to the [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan]], they exclude ''coups d'\u00e9tat'', civil wars, revolts, and rebellions that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority (such as [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 or the [[American Civil War]]), as well as peaceful transitions to [[democracy]] through institutional arrangements such as [[plebiscite]]s and [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]], as in [[Spain]] after the death of [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=\"Goldstonet4\"/>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Social movement|Social Movements]]\n* [[Age of Revolution]]\n* [[Classless society]]\n* [[Passive revolution]]\n* [[Political warfare]]\n* [[Psychological warfare]]\n* [[Rebellion]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary wave]]\n* [[Right of revolution]]\n* [[Subversion]]\n* [[User revolt]] - A phenomenon related to the modern [[Internet]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Lists of revolutions===\n* [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]\n* [[List of fictional revolutions and coups]]\n* [[List of uprisings led by women]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Popovic, Srdja.
