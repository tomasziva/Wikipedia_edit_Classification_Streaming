The legislation governing this is the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]]. The term \"monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] standing stones and burial sites, through [[Roman Empire|Roman]] remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/scheduled-monuments/ | title = Scheduled Monuments | accessdate = 3 November 2015 | publisher = [[Historic England]] }}</ref>\n\nThere are 69 scheduled monuments in South Somerset.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scheduled Monuments|url=https://www.southsomerset.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/conservation/historic-heritage-conservation/scheduled-monuments/|publisher=South Somerset Council|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Archeological Sites|url=https://www.southsomerset.gov.uk/media/15496/a04_1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=South Somerset Council|accessdate=21 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025321/https://www.southsomerset.gov.uk/media/15496/a04_1.pdf|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some of the oldest are [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] or [[Iron Age]] including [[hillfort]]s, such as [[Kenwalch's Castle]] and [[Bowl barrow]]s.

The Low Ham mosaic is unique in Roman Britain in providing a narrative story in five panels: Aeneas sailing to Carthage, Aeneas meeting Dido, the couple out hunting, the couple embrace and Dido left alone after Aeneas' departure. It is the earliest piece of narrative art in the country. It was lifted in 1953 and is now on display in the [[Museum of Somerset]].

The Low Ham mosaic is unique in Roman Britain in providing a narrative story in five panels: Aeneas sailing to Carthage, Aeneas meeting Dido, the couple out hunting, the couple embrace and Dido left alone after Aeneas' departure. It is the earliest piece of narrative art in the country. It was lifted in 1953 and is now on display in the [[Museum of Somerset]].
