For several generations following the cessation of [[penal transportation]], many Australians felt a sense of shame about being descended from convicts, and many did not even attempt to investigate their families' origins for fear of finding convicts in their lineage. In recent decades community attitudes have changed, and many Australians with convict ancestors are now more comfortable investigating and discussing their past, wearing their forebears' status almost as a badge of pride. Colloquially, attempts by non-Australians to negatively connote convict pasts are laughed off by Australians, who are now more inclined to associate criminal forebears as evidence for the possession of more positively perceived Australian attributes such as [[anti-authoritarianism]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2008/2209906.htm The convict stain]  Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

It has been argued that the most common manifestation of this alienation among peoples from post-colonial nations at present is an appetite for all things American, from television and music, to clothing, slang, even names. However, the popularity of American culture across both formerly colonized and colonizer countries possibly negate this argument. Culturally alienated individuals will also exhibit little knowledge or interest in the history of their host society, placing no real value on such matters.<ref name=\"Empire Writes Back\" />\n\nThe issue of cultural alienation has led the Australian sociologists [[Brian Head (sociologist)|Brian Head]] and [[James Walter (sociologist)|James Walter]] to interpret the cultural cringe as the belief that one's own country occupies a \"subordinate cultural place on the periphery\" and that \"intellectual standards are set and innovations occur elsewhere.\"<ref name=\"another_look\" /> As a consequence, a person who holds this belief is inclined to devalue their own country's cultural, academic and artistic life, and to venerate the \"superior\" culture of another (colonising) country.\n\nA more sophisticated approach to the issues raised by the cultural cringe, as felt by artistic practitioners in former colonies around the world, was developed and advanced by the Australian art historian [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] in his essay 'The Provincialism Problem'.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Terry|authorlink=Terry Smith (art historian)|date=September 1974|title=The Provincialism Problem|journal=[[Artforum]]|pages=54\u201359}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Allophilia]]\n* [[Australian culture]]\n* [[Cargo cult]] (incl.

For several generations following the cessation of [[penal transportation]], many Australians felt a sense of shame about being descended from convicts, and many did not even attempt to investigate their families' origins for fear of finding convicts in their lineage. In recent decades community attitudes have changed, and many Australians with convict ancestors are now more comfortable investigating and discussing their past, wearing their forebears' status almost as a badge of pride. Colloquially, attempts by non-Australians to negatively connote convict pasts are laughed off by Australians, who are now more inclined to associate criminal forebears as evidence for the possession of more positively perceived Australian attributes such as [[anti-authoritarianism]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2008/2209906.htm The convict stain]  Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

A person who is culturally alienated places little value on their own or host culture, and instead hungers for that of a&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes imposed&nbsp;\u2013 colonising nation.<ref name=\"Empire Writes Back\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/empirewritesback0000ashc/page/9|title=The Empire Writes Back: Theory & Practice in Post-Colonial Studies|last=Ashcroft|first=Bill|author2=Gareth Griffiths|author3=Helen Tiffin|publisher=Routledge|year=1989|isbn=0-415-01209-0|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/empirewritesback0000ashc/page/9 9\u201310, 61, 104\u20135, 144]}}</ref><ref name=\"Location of Culture\">{{cite book|title=The Location of Culture|last=Bhabha|first=Homi|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0-415-33639-2|location=London}}</ref> The post-colonial theorists Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths and [[Helen Tiffin]] link alienation with a sense of dislocation or displacement some peoples (especially those from immigrant cultures) will feel when they look to a distant nation for their values.<ref name=\"Empire Writes Back\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/ashcroft3f.html|title=Place and displacement|last=Ashcroft|first=Bill|year=1989|work=The Empire Writes Back: Theory and Practice in Post-Colonial Literatures|publisher=[[Routledge]]|accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref> Culturally alienated societies often exhibit a weak sense of cultural self-identity and place little worth on themselves.  It has been argued that the most common manifestation of this alienation among peoples from post-colonial nations at present is an appetite for all things American, from television and music, to clothing, slang, even names. However, the popularity of American culture across both formerly colonized and colonizer countries possibly negate this argument. Culturally alienated individuals will also exhibit little knowledge or interest in the history of their host society, placing no real value on such matters.<ref name=\"Empire Writes Back\" />\n\nThe issue of cultural alienation has led the Australian sociologists [[Brian Head (sociologist)|Brian Head]] and [[James Walter (sociologist)|James Walter]] to interpret the cultural cringe as the belief that one's own country occupies a \"subordinate cultural place on the periphery\" and that \"intellectual standards are set and innovations occur elsewhere.\"<ref name=\"another_look\" /> As a consequence, a person who holds this belief is inclined to devalue their own country's cultural, academic and artistic life, and to venerate the \"superior\" culture of another (colonising) country.\n\nA more sophisticated approach to the issues raised by the cultural cringe, as felt by artistic practitioners in former colonies around the world, was developed and advanced by the Australian art historian [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] in his essay 'The Provincialism Problem'.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Terry|authorlink=Terry Smith (art historian)|date=September 1974|title=The Provincialism Problem|journal=[[Artforum]]|pages=54\u201359}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Allophilia]]\n* [[Australian culture]]\n* [[Cargo cult]] (incl.
