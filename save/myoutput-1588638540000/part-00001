Slash-and-burn leaves only 3% of the carbon from the organic material in the soil.<ref>{{harvnb|Glaser|Lehmann|Zech|2002|pp=note 7 at 225}} \"The published data average at about 3% charcoal formation of the original biomass C.\"</ref>\n\nSlash-and-char can keep up to 50% of the carbon in a highly stable form.<ref>''Biochar Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems \u2013 A Review'', by Johannes Lehmann, John Gaunt, and Marco Rondon.

Using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for [[cellulosic ethanol]] does. Additionally, the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|2007b|pp=note 9 at 143}} \"It can be mixed with manures or fertilizers and included in no-tillage methods, without the need for additional equipment.\"</ref>\n\n=== Water retention ===\n\nBiochar is [[hygroscopic]]. Thus it is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water. This is possible because of its [[porosity|porous structure]] and high [[specific surface area]].<ref>[https://www.agronomy.org/files/students/2010-ricigliano-entry.pdf Terra Pretas: Charcoal Amendments Influence on Relict Soils and Modern Agriculture]</ref> As a result, nutrients such as [[phosphate]], and [[agrochemical]]s are retained for the plants benefit. Plants are therefore healthier, and less [[fertilizer]] leaches into [[Surface water|surface]] or [[groundwater]].\n\n=== Energy production: bio-oil and syngas ===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\nMobile pyrolysis units can be used to lower the costs of transportation of the biomass if the biochar is returned to the soil and the syngas stream is used to power the process.<ref>{{harvnb|Badger|Fransham|2006|pp= 322}}</ref><ref>Michael Jacobson, Cedric Briens and Franco Berruti, \"Lift tube technology for increasing heat transfer in an annular pyrolysis reactor\", CFB\u20199, Hamburg, Germany, 13\u201316 May 2008.</ref> Bio-oil contains organic acids that are corrosive to steel containers, has a high water vapor content that is detrimental to ignition, and, unless carefully cleaned, contains some biochar particles which can block injectors.<ref>Yaman, Serdar, ''pyrolysis of biomass to produce fuels and chemical feedstocks'', 45 Energy Conversion & MGMT 651, 659 (2003).</ref> Currently, it is less suitable for use as a kind of [[biodiesel]] than other sources.\n\nIf biochar is used for the production of energy rather than as a soil amendment, it can be directly substituted for any application that uses coal. Pyrolysis also may be the most cost-effective way of [[electricity generation]] from biomaterial.<ref>Bridgwater, A. V., A.J. Toft, and J.G. Brammer, ''A techno-economic comparison of power production by biomass fast pyrolysis with gasification and combustion'', 6 Renewable & Sustainable Energy Rev. 181, 231 (\"the fast pyrolysis and diesel engine system is clearly the most economic of the novel systems at scales up to 15 MWe\")</ref>\n\n=== Stock fodder ===\nA [[West Australia]]n farmer has explored the use of biochar mixed with [[molasses]] as stock [[fodder]]. He asserts that in [[ruminant]]s, biochar can assist digestion and reduce [[Methane#Ruminants|methane production]]. The farmer also uses [[dung beetle]]s to work the biochar infused dung down into the soil without using machinery. It is proposed that the nitrogen and carbon in the dung are both incorporated into the soil rather than staying on the soil surface, reducing the production of [[Nitrous oxide#Greenhouse effect|nitrous oxide]] and [[Carbon dioxide#In Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]], which are both greenhouse gasses. The nitrogen and carbon then both add to soil fertility.

[[Topsoil]]s from these 'black spots' had a higher organic C concentration [3.6 \u00b1 0.9% organic carbon (OC)] than adjacent soils outside these black spots (2.1 \u00b1 0.2% OC). The soils had been cropped with maize for at least 12 years which provided a continuous input of C with a C isotope signature (\u03b413C) \u221213.1, distinct from the \u03b413C of soil organic carbon (\u221227.4 \u2030) and charcoal (\u221225.7 \u2030) collected in the surrounding area. The isotope signatures in the soil revealed that maize-derived C concentration was significantly higher in charcoal-amended samples ('black spots') than in adjacent unamended ones (0.44% vs. 0.31%; P = 0.02). Topsoils were subsequently collected as a gradient across two 'black spots' along with corresponding adjacent soils outside these black spots and soil respiration, and physical soil fractionation was conducted. Total soil respiration (130 days) was unaffected by charcoal, but the maize-derived C respiration per unit maize-derived OC in soil significantly decreased about half (P < 0.02) with increasing charcoal-derived C in soil. Maize-derived C was proportionally present more in protected soil aggregates in the presence of charcoal. The lower specific mineralization and increased C sequestration of recent C with charcoal are attributed to a combination of physical protection, C saturation of microbial communities and, potentially, slightly higher annual primary production. Overall, this study provides evidence of the capacity of biochar to enhance C sequestration in soils through reduced C turnover on the long term. ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12250/full Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2015]).\n\nBiochar sequesters carbon (C) in soils because of its prolonged residence time, ranging from several years to millennia. In addition, biochar can promote indirect C-sequestration by increasing crop yield while, potentially, reducing C-mineralization. Laboratory studies have evidenced effects of biochar on C-mineralization using 13C isotope signatures. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715312614 (Kerre et al, 2016)]\n\nFluorescence analysis of the dissolved organic matter from soil amended with biochar revealed that biochar application increased a humic-like fluorescent component, likely associated with biochar-carbon in solution. The combined spectroscopy-microscopy approach revealed the accumulation of aromatic-carbon in discrete spots in the solid-phase of microaggregates and its co-localization with clay minerals for soil amended with raw residue or biochar. The co-localization of aromatic-C:polysaccharides-C was consistently reduced upon biochar application. These finding suggested that reduced C metabolism is an important mechanism for C stabilization in biochar-amended soils [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25127 (Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2016)]\n\nStudents at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in New Jersey are developing [[supercapacitor]]s that use electrodes made of biochar.<ref name=Supercapacitors>{{cite web\n  |title=A Cheaper, Greener Material for Supercapacitors\n  |url=http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2859:a-cheaper-greener-material-for-supercapacitors&catid=52:applications-tech-research&Itemid=247\n  |publisher=[[Stevens Institute of Technology]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=25 May 2011\n}}</ref> A process developed by [[University of Florida]] researchers that removes [[phosphate]] from water, also yields [[methane gas]] usable as fuel and phosphate-laden carbon suitable for enriching soil.<ref name=\"Removing Phosphate from Water\">{{cite web\n  |title=Biochar\" More Effective, Cheaper at Removing Phosphate from Water\n  |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2011/05/18/biochar-more-effective-cheaper-at-removing-phosphate-from-water.aspx\n  |publisher=[[University of Florida]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=18 May 2011\n}}</ref> \nResearchers at the University of Auckland are also working on utilizing biochar in concrete applications to reduce carbon emissions during concrete production and to improve the strength considerably.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akhtar | first1 = A. | last2 = Sarmah | first2 = A.

An alternative is to use small amounts of biochar in lower cost biochar-fertilizer complexes.<ref>Joseph, S., Graber, E.R., Chia, C., Munroe, P., Donne, S., Thomas, T., Nielsen, S., Marjo, C., Rutlidge, H., Pan, GX., Li, L., Taylor, P., Rawal, A., Hook, J.

Slash-and-burn leaves only 3% of the carbon from the organic material in the soil.<ref>{{harvnb|Glaser|Lehmann|Zech|2002|pp=note 7 at 225}} \"The published data average at about 3% charcoal formation of the original biomass C.\"</ref>\n\nSlash-and-char can keep up to 50% of the carbon in a highly stable form.<ref>''Biochar Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems \u2013 A Review'', by Johannes Lehmann, John Gaunt, and Marco Rondon.

Using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for [[cellulosic ethanol]] does. Additionally, the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|2007b|pp=note 9 at 143}} \"It can be mixed with manures or fertilizers and included in no-tillage methods, without the need for additional equipment.\"</ref>\n\n=== Water retention ===\n\nBiochar is [[hygroscopic]]. Thus it is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water. This is possible because of its [[porosity|porous structure]] and high [[specific surface area]].<ref>[https://www.agronomy.org/files/students/2010-ricigliano-entry.pdf Terra Pretas: Charcoal Amendments Influence on Relict Soils and Modern Agriculture]</ref> As a result, nutrients such as [[phosphate]], and [[agrochemical]]s are retained for the plants benefit. Plants are therefore healthier, and less [[fertilizer]] leaches into [[Surface water|surface]] or [[groundwater]].\n\n=== Energy production: bio-oil and syngas ===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\nMobile pyrolysis units can be used to lower the costs of transportation of the biomass if the biochar is returned to the soil and the syngas stream is used to power the process.<ref>{{harvnb|Badger|Fransham|2006|pp= 322}}</ref><ref>Michael Jacobson, Cedric Briens and Franco Berruti, \"Lift tube technology for increasing heat transfer in an annular pyrolysis reactor\", CFB\u20199, Hamburg, Germany, 13\u201316 May 2008.</ref> Bio-oil contains organic acids that are corrosive to steel containers, has a high water vapor content that is detrimental to ignition, and, unless carefully cleaned, contains some biochar particles which can block injectors.<ref>Yaman, Serdar, ''pyrolysis of biomass to produce fuels and chemical feedstocks'', 45 Energy Conversion & MGMT 651, 659 (2003).</ref> Currently, it is less suitable for use as a kind of [[biodiesel]] than other sources.\n\nIf biochar is used for the production of energy rather than as a soil amendment, it can be directly substituted for any application that uses coal. Pyrolysis also may be the most cost-effective way of [[electricity generation]] from biomaterial.<ref>Bridgwater, A. V., A.J. Toft, and J.G. Brammer, ''A techno-economic comparison of power production by biomass fast pyrolysis with gasification and combustion'', 6 Renewable & Sustainable Energy Rev. 181, 231 (\"the fast pyrolysis and diesel engine system is clearly the most economic of the novel systems at scales up to 15 MWe\")</ref>\n\n=== Stock fodder ===\nA [[West Australia]]n farmer has explored the use of biochar mixed with [[molasses]] as stock [[fodder]]. He asserts that in [[ruminant]]s, biochar can assist digestion and reduce [[Methane#Ruminants|methane production]]. The farmer also uses [[dung beetle]]s to work the biochar infused dung down into the soil without using machinery. It is proposed that the nitrogen and carbon in the dung are both incorporated into the soil rather than staying on the soil surface, reducing the production of [[Nitrous oxide#Greenhouse effect|nitrous oxide]] and [[Carbon dioxide#In Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]], which are both greenhouse gasses. The nitrogen and carbon then both add to soil fertility. There is also on-farm evidence that the fodder has led to improvements of liveweight gain in [[Angus cattle|Angus-cross cattle]].<ref name=\"abc.net.au-2019-10-18-beetles-charcoal\">{{cite web\n | url =https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2019-10-18/wa-farmer-uses-beetles-and-charcoal-to-combat-climate-change/11613846\n | title =Poo-eating beetles and charcoal used by WA farmer to combat climate change\n | last =Daly\n | first =Jon\n | date =18 October 2019\n | website =ABC.net.au\n | publisher =Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n | access-date =18 October 2019\n | quote =Mr Pow said his innovative farming system could help livestock producers become more profitable while helping to address the impact of climate change. }}</ref>\n\nDoug Pow won the Australian Government Innovation in Agriculture Land Management Award at the 2019 Western Australian [[Landcare in Australia|Landcare]] Awards for this innovation.<ref name=\"landcareawards2019\">{{cite web\n | url =https://landcareaustralia.org.au/landcareawards2019\n | title =2019 State & Territory Landcare Awards Celebrate Outstanding Landcare Champions\n | date =2019\n | website =Landcare Australia\n | publisher =Landcare Australia\n | access-date =18 October 2019\n }}</ref><ref name=\"abc.net.au-2019-10-18-beetles-charcoal\" /> Mr Pow's work led to two further trials on dairy cattle, with the results of odour reduction and increased milk production.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://landcareaustralia.org.au/news/manjimup-farmer-employing-dung-beetle-to-tackle-climate-change-set-to-represent-wa-on-national-stage/\n | title =Manjimup farmer employing dung beetle to tackle climate-change set to represent WA on national stage\n | date =October 2019\n | website =Landcare Australia\n | publisher =Landcare Australia\n | access-date =18 October 2019\n }}</ref>\n\n== Direct and indirect benefits ==\n<!--This section should be merged into above sections:-->\n* The pyrolysis of forest- or agriculture-derived biomass residue generates a biofuel without competition with crop production.\n* Biochar is a pyrolysis byproduct that may be ploughed into soils in crop fields to enhance their fertility and stability, and for medium- to long-term carbon sequestration in these soils.

[[Topsoil]]s from these 'black spots' had a higher organic C concentration [3.6 \u00b1 0.9% organic carbon (OC)] than adjacent soils outside these black spots (2.1 \u00b1 0.2% OC). The soils had been cropped with maize for at least 12 years which provided a continuous input of C with a C isotope signature (\u03b413C) \u221213.1, distinct from the \u03b413C of soil organic carbon (\u221227.4 \u2030) and charcoal (\u221225.7 \u2030) collected in the surrounding area. The isotope signatures in the soil revealed that maize-derived C concentration was significantly higher in charcoal-amended samples ('black spots') than in adjacent unamended ones (0.44% vs. 0.31%; P = 0.02). Topsoils were subsequently collected as a gradient across two 'black spots' along with corresponding adjacent soils outside these black spots and soil respiration, and physical soil fractionation was conducted. Total soil respiration (130 days) was unaffected by charcoal, but the maize-derived C respiration per unit maize-derived OC in soil significantly decreased about half (P < 0.02) with increasing charcoal-derived C in soil. Maize-derived C was proportionally present more in protected soil aggregates in the presence of charcoal. The lower specific mineralization and increased C sequestration of recent C with charcoal are attributed to a combination of physical protection, C saturation of microbial communities and, potentially, slightly higher annual primary production. Overall, this study provides evidence of the capacity of biochar to enhance C sequestration in soils through reduced C turnover on the long term. ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12250/full Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2015]).\n\nBiochar sequesters carbon (C) in soils because of its prolonged residence time, ranging from several years to millennia. In addition, biochar can promote indirect C-sequestration by increasing crop yield while, potentially, reducing C-mineralization. Laboratory studies have evidenced effects of biochar on C-mineralization using 13C isotope signatures. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715312614 (Kerre et al, 2016)]\n\nFluorescence analysis of the dissolved organic matter from soil amended with biochar revealed that biochar application increased a humic-like fluorescent component, likely associated with biochar-carbon in solution. The combined spectroscopy-microscopy approach revealed the accumulation of aromatic-carbon in discrete spots in the solid-phase of microaggregates and its co-localization with clay minerals for soil amended with raw residue or biochar. The co-localization of aromatic-C:polysaccharides-C was consistently reduced upon biochar application. These finding suggested that reduced C metabolism is an important mechanism for C stabilization in biochar-amended soils [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25127 (Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2016)]\n\nStudents at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in New Jersey are developing [[supercapacitor]]s that use electrodes made of biochar.<ref name=Supercapacitors>{{cite web\n  |title=A Cheaper, Greener Material for Supercapacitors\n  |url=http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2859:a-cheaper-greener-material-for-supercapacitors&catid=52:applications-tech-research&Itemid=247\n  |publisher=[[Stevens Institute of Technology]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=25 May 2011\n}}</ref> A process developed by [[University of Florida]] researchers that removes [[phosphate]] from water, also yields [[methane gas]] usable as fuel and phosphate-laden carbon suitable for enriching soil.<ref name=\"Removing Phosphate from Water\">{{cite web\n  |title=Biochar\" More Effective, Cheaper at Removing Phosphate from Water\n  |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2011/05/18/biochar-more-effective-cheaper-at-removing-phosphate-from-water.aspx\n  |publisher=[[University of Florida]]\n  |year=2011\n  |accessdate=18 May 2011\n}}</ref> \nResearchers at the University of Auckland are also working on utilizing biochar in concrete applications to reduce carbon emissions during concrete production and to improve the strength considerably.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akhtar | first1 = A. | last2 = Sarmah | first2 = A.
