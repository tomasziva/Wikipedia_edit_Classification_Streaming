She counted Judd and [[Joseph Cornell]] among her friends and supporters. However, she did not profit financially from her work.

The room, which measures {{convert|13|sqft|m2}} and was filled with over 60 pumpkin sculptures, was one of the museum's most popular attractions ever. Allison Peck, a spokeswoman for the Hirshhorn, said in an interview that the museum \"has never had a show with that kind of visitor demand\", with the room averaging over 8,000 visitors between its opening and the date of its temporary closing. While there were conflicting media reports about the cost of the damaged sculpture and how exactly it was broken, Allison Peck stated that \"there is no intrinsic value to the individual piece. It is a manufactured component to a larger piece.\" The exhibit was reconfigured to make up for the missing sculpture, and a new one was to be produced for the exhibit by Kusama.<ref name=\"Hauser\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/arts/design/hirshhorn-museum-sculpture-damaged.html|title=Kusama Infinity Room Reopens at Hirshhorn Exhibition After Sculpture Damage|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=28 February 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=11 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The Infinity Mirrors exhibit became a sensation among art critics as well as on social media.

The kimono suggested traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, was made to look inauthentic, as it was actually a black umbrella, painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walked down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turned and cried without reason, and eventually walked away and vanished from view.\n\nThis performance, through the association of the kimono, involved the stereotypes that Asian-American women continued to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation altered the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama was able to highlight the stereotype in which her white American audience categorized her, by showing the absurdity of culturally categorizing people in the world's largest melting pot.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Stacy E.|title=Asian American Women Artists: Performative Strategies Redefined|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|year=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=105\u201327|doi=10.1353/jaas.2012.0000}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1968, the film ''Kusama's Self-Obliteration'' which Kusama produced and starred in won a prize at the Fourth International Experimental Film Competition in [[Belgium]] and the Second [[Maryland Film Festival]] and the second prize at the [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]].

She counted Judd and [[Joseph Cornell]] among her friends and supporters. However, she did not profit financially from her work. Around this time, Kusama was hospitalized regularly from overwork, and O'Keeffe convinced her own dealer Edith Herbert to purchase several works to help Kusama stave off financial hardship.<ref name=\"QAG\">[http://interactive.qag.qld.gov.au/looknowseeforever/timeline/ Yayoi Kusama Timeline] Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane.</ref> Many men artists copied her creativity, which made the men famous, but not Kusama.

The kimono suggested traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, was made to look inauthentic, as it was actually a black umbrella, painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walked down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turned and cried without reason, and eventually walked away and vanished from view.\n\nThis performance, through the association of the kimono, involved the stereotypes that Asian-American women continued to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation altered the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama was able to highlight the stereotype in which her white American audience categorized her, by showing the absurdity of culturally categorizing people in the world's largest melting pot.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Stacy E.|title=Asian American Women Artists: Performative Strategies Redefined|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|year=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=105\u201327|doi=10.1353/jaas.2012.0000}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1968, the film ''Kusama's Self-Obliteration'' which Kusama produced and starred in won a prize at the Fourth International Experimental Film Competition in [[Belgium]] and the Second [[Maryland Film Festival]] and the second prize at the [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]].
