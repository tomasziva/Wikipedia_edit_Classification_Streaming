Lee was leader of Headquarters Platoon, Troop A, 117th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized, at Montrevel, France, on September 2, 1944, when the Germans mounted a strong counterattack, isolating the town and engaging its outnumbered defenders in a pitched battle. After the fight had raged for hours and our forces had withstood heavy shelling and armor-supported infantry attacks, 2d Lt. Lee organized a patrol to knock out mortars which were inflicting heavy casualties on the beleaguered reconnaissance troops. He led the small group to the edge of the town, sweeping enemy riflemen out of position on a ridge from which he observed 7 Germans manning 2 large mortars near an armored [[half-track]] about 100 yards down the reverse slope. Armed with a rifle and grenades, he left his men on the high ground and crawled to within 30 yards of the mortars, where the enemy discovered him and unleashed [[machine-pistol]] fire which shattered his right thigh. Scorning retreat, bleeding and suffering intense pain, he dragged himself relentlessly forward. He killed 5 of the enemy with rifle fire and the others fled before he reached their position. Fired on by an [[Armored car (military)|armored car]], he took cover behind the German half-track and there found a [[panzerfaust]] with which to neutralize this threat. Despite his wounds, he inched his way toward the car through withering machinegun fire, maneuvering into range, and blasted the vehicle with a round from the rocket launcher, forcing it to withdraw. Having cleared the slope of hostile troops, he struggle back to his men, where he collapsed from pain and loss of blood. 2d Lt. Lee's outstanding gallantry, willing risk of life, and extreme tenacity of purpose in coming to grips with the enemy, although suffering from grievous wounds, set an example of bravery and devotion to duty in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|World War II}}\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients]]\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II#L|List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II]]\n\n==References==\n:{{ACMH}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Find a Grave|7745802|work=Claim to Fame: Medal of Honor recipients|accessdate=2008-01-12}}\n*{{cite web\n  |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n  |title = Medal of Honor recipients - World War II (G\u2013L)\n  |work = Medal of Honor citations\n  |date = June 8, 2009\n  |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-g-l.html\n  |accessdate = 2008-01-12}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lee, Daniel W.}}\n[[Category:1919 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:American army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients]]\n[[Category:United States Army officers]]\n[[Category:People from Bacon County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|name=Daniel W.
