The boats have been in service since 1990 and are all named after [[sea mammal]]s.\n\n==History==\nIn 1974, the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] announced, through the defensenote 1974, that it wanted to replace the aging [[Dolfijn-class submarine]]s.<ref name=\"defensienota1974\">H. Vredeling, C.L.J. van Lent, A. Stemerdink, pp. 61.</ref> Since the 1960s the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] had been conducting studies and research into what kind of submarines they wanted to build to replace the older \u2018\u2019Dolfijn\u2019\u2019.<ref name=\"GlobalSecurity\">{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/walrus.htm|title=Walrus|work=www.globalsecurity.org |date= | accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref> This research initiative concluded that the [[Netherlands]] should build conventional diesel-electric submarines, as nuclear submarines were costly and could only be constructed, crewed, and maintained by countries with major navies such as the [[United States]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Nonetheless, even with the diesel-electric submarine the Dutch government also wanted to look if they could try to work together with international allies for the construction because else it would lead to more costs.<ref name=\"defensienota1974\" />\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978 the design of the Walrus-class was for the most part completed, and included many improvements which would result in the new submarines being state of the art and a significant improvement over previous submarines in use by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.navyinside.nl/frontpage/onderzeeboten_walrusklasse|title=Onderzeeboten \"Walrusklasse\"|work=www.navyinside.nl|date=|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328041240/http://www.navyinside.nl/frontpage/onderzeeboten_walrusklasse|archive-date=2018-03-28|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> For example, a special kind of French-produced steel was used to construct the hull of the Walrus-class submarines; this steel proved to be more elastic, allowing the submarines of the class to dive deeper than previous submarines. Furthermore, there was a focus put on automation that was aimed at decreasing the manpower needed to operate the submarine while at the same time making them more effective against threats.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://marineschepen.nl/schepen/walrus.html|title=Walrusklasse onderzeeboten |work=www.marineschepen.nl |date=10 November 2016 | accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\nOn 19 June 1979 the Dutch [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Minister of Defense]], [[Willem Scholten]], signed a contract worth 425 million [[Dutch guilder|guilders]] with the [[Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij]] (RDM) to build 2 submarines to replace the [[Dolfijn-class submarine]]s, with the construction of the second boat to be started in the following year.<ref name=\"rdmarchiefwalrus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rdm-archief.nl/RDM-NB/RDM-348.html|title=Bouwnummer RDM-348, Hr.

To make sure the construction of the submarines was continued RDM was re-established as an independent company. Furthermore, the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] ordered an additional 2 submarines of the Walrus-class earlier than planned to help RDM financially.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> However, at this time the ''Walrus''-class submarines were still plagued with many problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1984-11-21/edition/0/page/5|title=Kamer stemt in met 'zuivering': Reorganisatie van marinetop|language=dutch|work=www.leiden.courant.nu |date=21 November 1984 | accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNew problems arose on 14 August 1986, when the command center of the [[HNLMS Walrus (1985)|HNLMS ''Walrus'']] caught fire, while it was still on a scaffold in the yard.<ref name=\"auto3\">de Bles, Boven and Homburg, pp. 104</ref> The fire lasted about five hours and resulted in immense damage to the submarine, the command center was completely burned out, including all the recently installed equipment.<ref name=\"RDMarchiefbruinvis\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rdm-archief.nl/RDM-NB/RDM-353.html|title=Bouwnummer RDM-353, Hr.

The costs of the resulting damage was 225 million [[Dutch guilder|guilders]], however, the damage was fully covered by insurance.<ref name=\"RDMarchiefbruinvis\" /> The exact location, origin and cause of the fire was never found out. Presumably, the fire was caused in the vicinity of the corporals and men washroom by a defect in the electrical work lighting. The damaged submarine was repaired and in 1987 it was reported that these repairs had been completed.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Due to the fire, the construction of the Walrus was so delayed that the second submarine, with construction number 349, was put into service as the first submarine of the ''Walrus''-class with the name [[HNLMS Zeeleeuw (1987)|HNLMS ''Zeeleeuw'']]. The [[HNLMS Walrus (1985)|HNLMS ''Walrus'']] was put into service two years later. The two other boats were put into service as [[HNLMS Dolfijn (1990)|HNLMS ''Dolfijn'']] and [[HNLMS Bruinvis (1992)|HNLMS ''Bruinvis'']]. The delays also meant that the [[HNLMS Dolfijn (S808)|HNLMS ''Dolfijn'']], the [[HNLMS Potvis (S804)|HNLMS ''Potvis'']] and the [[HNLMS Tonijn (S805)|HNLMS ''Tonijn'']] of the [[Dolfijn-class submarine|''Dolfijn''-class]] had to remain in service longer than planned.<ref name=\"RDMarchiefbruinvis\" /> All the problems, delays and rising costs were eventually dubbed by the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Dutch national parliament]] as the ''Walrus-affair''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Nonetheless, at the time of their commissioning, the ''Walrus''-class submarines were considered to be one of the most modern and advanced conventional submarines that were operational at the time.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Walrus''-class submarines are unusual in that instead of a cross-shaped assembly of [[stern]] [[diving plane]]s and [[rudder]]s, they mount four combined rudders and diving planes in an \"X\" configuration.<ref name=\"walrusnavaltechnology\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/walrus-class-submarines/|title=Walrus-Class Submarines|website=www.naval-technology.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This tail configuration was first tested in 1960 on the [[United States Navy]]'s {{USS|Albacore|AGSS-569|6}}, and has since been used by the ''Walrus'' class, all [[Swedish Navy]] submarines since the {{sclass-|Sj\u00f6ormen|submarine|4}}, the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|4}}, the [[German Navy|German]] [[Type 212 submarine|Type&nbsp;212A]] and the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]'s {{sclass-|S\u014dry\u016b|submarine|4}}.The X configuration is a complex system and therefore not in use by a lot of navies around the world.<ref name=\"GlobalSecurity\"/>\n\nThe submarines of the ''Walrus''-class are invisible when submerged, silent and therefore difficult to detect by ships, planes and other submarines once they go into hiding.<ref name=\"defensieonderzeeboten\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.defensie.nl/onderwerpen/materieel/schepen/onderzeeboten|title=Onderzeeboten|website=www.defensie.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-06-22|date=2015-11-30}}</ref> This makes the boats very suitable for the combatting surface vessels and submarines, the protection of own units, information gathering, and early warning, and supporting of special operations.

By 2017, there is still no political agreement on the amount of new submarines to be ordered; nor the type and tasks it should be able to perform. However, it seems certain that they will be replaced, since the alleged Russian threat was regarded an incentive to invest in a new class. The Minister of Defence, however, delayed the replacement by two years until 2027. Roughly, there are two groups in the Dutch parliament \u2013 one in favor of replacing the Walrus-class by an equally capable class of large, expeditionary, diesel-electric sub, and the other in favor of choosing a cheaper solution of smaller diesel-electrics, similar to Swedish and German submarines. It is unknown where the new boats will most likely be built; since the Dutch RDM yard (the only Dutch yard capable of building subs) that constructed the Walrus-class is no longer in operation.

The boats have been in service since 1990 and are all named after [[sea mammal]]s.\n\n==History==\nIn 1974, the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] announced, through the defensenote 1974, that it wanted to replace the aging [[Dolfijn-class submarine]]s.<ref name=\"defensienota1974\">H. Vredeling, C.L.J. van Lent, A. Stemerdink, pp. 61.</ref> Since the 1960s the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] had been conducting studies and research into what kind of submarines they wanted to build to replace the older \u2018\u2019Dolfijn\u2019\u2019.<ref name=\"GlobalSecurity\">{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/walrus.htm|title=Walrus|work=www.globalsecurity.org |date= | accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref> This research initiative concluded that the [[Netherlands]] should build conventional diesel-electric submarines, as nuclear submarines were costly and could only be constructed, crewed, and maintained by countries with major navies such as the [[United States]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Nonetheless, even with the diesel-electric submarine the Dutch government also wanted to look if they could try to work together with international allies for the construction because else it would lead to more costs.<ref name=\"defensienota1974\" />\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978 the design of the Walrus-class was for the most part completed, and included many improvements which would result in the new submarines being state of the art and a significant improvement over previous submarines in use by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.navyinside.nl/frontpage/onderzeeboten_walrusklasse|title=Onderzeeboten \"Walrusklasse\"|work=www.navyinside.nl|date=|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328041240/http://www.navyinside.nl/frontpage/onderzeeboten_walrusklasse|archive-date=2018-03-28|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> For example, a special kind of French-produced steel was used to construct the hull of the Walrus-class submarines; this steel proved to be more elastic, allowing the submarines of the class to dive deeper than previous submarines. Furthermore, there was a focus put on automation that was aimed at decreasing the manpower needed to operate the submarine while at the same time making them more effective against threats.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://marineschepen.nl/schepen/walrus.html|title=Walrusklasse onderzeeboten |work=www.marineschepen.nl |date=10 November 2016 | accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\nOn 19 June 1979 the Dutch [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Minister of Defense]], [[Willem Scholten]], signed a contract worth 425 million [[Dutch guilder|guilders]] with the [[Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij]] (RDM) to build 2 submarines to replace the [[Dolfijn-class submarine]]s, with the construction of the second boat to be started in the following year.<ref name=\"rdmarchiefwalrus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rdm-archief.nl/RDM-NB/RDM-348.html|title=Bouwnummer RDM-348, Hr.

To make sure the construction of the submarines was continued RDM was re-established as an independent company. Furthermore, the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] ordered an additional 2 submarines of the Walrus-class earlier than planned to help RDM financially.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> However, at this time the ''Walrus''-class submarines were still plagued with many problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1984-11-21/edition/0/page/5|title=Kamer stemt in met 'zuivering': Reorganisatie van marinetop|language=dutch|work=www.leiden.courant.nu |date=21 November 1984 | accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNew problems arose on 14 August 1986, when the command center of the [[HNLMS Walrus (1985)|HNLMS ''Walrus'']] caught fire, while it was still on a scaffold in the yard.<ref name=\"auto3\">de Bles, Boven and Homburg, pp. 104</ref> The fire lasted about five hours and resulted in immense damage to the submarine, the command center was completely burned out, including all the recently installed equipment.<ref name=\"RDMarchiefbruinvis\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rdm-archief.nl/RDM-NB/RDM-353.html|title=Bouwnummer RDM-353, Hr.

Presumably, the fire was caused in the vicinity of the corporals and men washroom by a defect in the electrical work lighting. The damaged submarine was repaired and in 1987 it was reported that these repairs had been completed.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Due to the fire, the construction of the Walrus was so delayed that the second submarine, with construction number 349, was put into service as the first submarine of the ''Walrus''-class with the name [[HNLMS Zeeleeuw (1987)|HNLMS ''Zeeleeuw'']]. The [[HNLMS Walrus (1985)|HNLMS ''Walrus'']] was put into service two years later. The two other boats were put into service as [[HNLMS Dolfijn (1990)|HNLMS ''Dolfijn'']] and [[HNLMS Bruinvis (1992)|HNLMS ''Bruinvis'']]. The delays also meant that the [[HNLMS Dolfijn (S808)|HNLMS ''Dolfijn'']], the [[HNLMS Potvis (S804)|HNLMS ''Potvis'']] and the [[HNLMS Tonijn (S805)|HNLMS ''Tonijn'']] of the [[Dolfijn-class submarine|''Dolfijn''-class]] had to remain in service longer than planned.<ref name=\"RDMarchiefbruinvis\" /> All the problems, delays and rising costs were eventually dubbed by the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Dutch national parliament]] as the ''Walrus-affair''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Nonetheless, at the time of their commissioning, the ''Walrus''-class submarines were considered to be one of the most modern and advanced conventional submarines that were operational at the time.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Walrus''-class submarines are unusual in that instead of a cross-shaped assembly of [[stern]] [[diving plane]]s and [[rudder]]s, they mount four combined rudders and diving planes in an \"X\" configuration.<ref name=\"walrusnavaltechnology\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/walrus-class-submarines/|title=Walrus-Class Submarines|website=www.naval-technology.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This tail configuration was first tested in 1960 on the [[United States Navy]]'s {{USS|Albacore|AGSS-569|6}}, and has since been used by the ''Walrus'' class, all [[Swedish Navy]] submarines since the {{sclass-|Sj\u00f6ormen|submarine|4}}, the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|4}}, the [[German Navy|German]] [[Type 212 submarine|Type&nbsp;212A]] and the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]'s {{sclass-|S\u014dry\u016b|submarine|4}}.The X configuration is a complex system and therefore not in use by a lot of navies around the world.<ref name=\"GlobalSecurity\"/>\n\nThe submarines of the ''Walrus''-class are invisible when submerged, silent and therefore difficult to detect by ships, planes and other submarines once they go into hiding.<ref name=\"defensieonderzeeboten\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.defensie.nl/onderwerpen/materieel/schepen/onderzeeboten|title=Onderzeeboten|website=www.defensie.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-06-22|date=2015-11-30}}</ref> This makes the boats very suitable for the combatting surface vessels and submarines, the protection of own units, information gathering, and early warning, and supporting of special operations.

Roughly, there are two groups in the Dutch parliament \u2013 one in favor of replacing the Walrus-class by an equally capable class of large, expeditionary, diesel-electric sub, and the other in favor of choosing a cheaper solution of smaller diesel-electrics, similar to Swedish and German submarines. It is unknown where the new boats will most likely be built; since the Dutch RDM yard (the only Dutch yard capable of building subs) that constructed the Walrus-class is no longer in operation. The Defensenote (Defense policy for the coming years) of March 2018 revealed that the Dutch government is still planning to replace the ''Walrus-class'' submarines in the future.<ref name=\"defensienota2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.defensie.nl/downloads/beleidsnota-s/2018/03/26/defensienota-2018 |title=Defensienota 2018|language=Dutch |publisher=Dutch Ministry of Defense |date=26 March 2018 |last= |first= |accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> The budget allocated at this time for the new submarines is more than 2.5&nbsp;billion euros. Additional information on how to proceed with the replacement will come at the end of 2018, when the Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld, will send a so-called B-letter to the Dutch parliament.<ref name=\"defensienota2018\" /> Minister Bijleveld also underlined in an interview that the new submarines should have the same niche capabilities as the current ''walrus-class'' submarines. This means that they have to be able to operate, and gather intelligence, in both shallow water close to the coast and in deep water in the ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bndestem.nl/politiek/we-gaan-niet-oplappen-we-gaan-vernieuwen~a2327cae/|title=We gaan niet oplappen, we gaan vernieuwen|language=Dutch |publisher=BNDeStem |date=27 March 2018 |last1=Keultjes |first1=Hanneke |last2=Boere |first2=Raymond |accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Contenders ===\nThe Ministry of Defence has shortlisted three bidders:<ref>{{cite web | url = https://navaltoday.com/2019/12/16/the-netherlands-3-bidders-shortlisted-for-submarine-replacement-program/ | date = 2019-12-16 | title = \nThe Netherlands: 3 bidders shortlisted for submarine replacement program | work = Naval Today }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2019/12/17/dutch-walrus-submarine-program-shuffles-forward-but-not-by-much/ | date = 2019-12-17 | title = One bidder out, three remain in Dutch race to replace Walrus subs | first =  Sebastian | last = Sprenger | work = Defense News | publisher = Sightline Media Group }}</ref>\n* [[Damen Group]] and [[Saab Group]] announced that they have teamed up from 2015 to jointly develop, offer and build next-generation submarines that are able to replace the current ''Walrus''-class submarines of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damen.com/en/news/2015/01/saab_and_damen_team_for_walrus_future_submarine_replacement_programme |title=Saab and Damen Team for Walrus Future Submarine Replacement Programme |work=www.damen.com |date=20 January 2015 | accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref> It was unveiled on 1 June 2018 that the design will be derived from the [[A26 submarine]].<ref name=\"DetailsJune2018DamenSaab\">{{cite web|url=https://marineschepen.nl/nieuws/Details-voorstel-Saab-Damen-nieuwe-Nederlandse-onderzeeboot-010618.html|title=Meer details voorstel nieuwe Nederlandse onderzeeboot van Saab en Damen|work=www.marineschepen.nl |date=5 June 2018 | accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"NIDVJune2018DamenSaab11-12\">Stichting Nederlandse Industrie voor Defensie en Veiligheid magazine editie 2-2018 (June 2018), accessed 12 June 2018, page 11-12.</ref> The proposed submarine is currently around 73 meter long and has a diameter of 8 meter.
