He studied between 1855 and 1858 at the Prague Academy of Arts with [[Eduard von Engerth]]. His studies included [[parapsychology]] ([[somnambulism]], [[hypnotism]], [[spiritism]]), [[Darwinism]], Asiatic philosophy, the ideas of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and various mystical traditions. The spiritual-mystical movement was emphasized by the writings of [[Carl du Prel]], and the [[Munich]] painter [[Albert Keller]] was also an influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iment.com/maida/family/mother/vicars/gabrielmax.htm|title=Period archives biography|publisher=www.iment.com|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis first large canvas was painted in 1858 while he was a student at the Prague Academy. He continued his studies at the Viennese Academy of Art with [[Karl von Blaas]], {{ill|Karl Mayer (painter)|de|Karl Mayer (Maler, 1810)}}, [[Christian Ruben]] and [[Carl Wurzinger]]. From 1863 to 1867 he studied at the Munich Academy with [[Karl Theodor von Piloty]], and also [[Hans Makart]] and [[Franz Defregger]]. His first critical success was in 1867 with the painting \"Martyr at the Cross\": that painting transformed the \"Ungl\u00fccksmalerei\" (dark palette) of Piloty into a religious-mystical symbolism using a psychological rendering of its subject.\n[[Image:GMax StillLifeGirlAtSpinet.jpg|thumb| ''Still Life (Girl at a [[Spinet]])'' (1871)]] \nHe continued to use the dark palette of the [[Karl Theodor von Piloty|Piloty]] school well into the 1870s, later moving toward a more muted palette, using fewer,clearer colors. From 1869, Gabriel von Max had his studio in Munich; in the summer, he was in the Ammerland at Starnberger Lake. From 1879-1883, Gabriel Max was a professor of Historical Painting at the Munich Academy; he also became a Fellow of [[The Theosophical Society]]. In 1900 he was ennobled and became a [[Ritter]]. He died in Munich in 1915.\n\nHis interest in anthropological studies also showed in his work. He owned a large scientific collection of prehistoric ethnological and anthropological finds: the collection and his correspondence now reside in the [[Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen]] in [[Mannheim]]. At his residence in Starnberger Lake, Gabriel Max surrounded himself with a family of monkeys, which he painted often, sometimes portraying them as human. Max, along with his colleagues, often used photographs to guide painting. The great number of monkey photographs in his archive testify to their use as direct translation into his paintings. In 1908, his painting \"The Lion's Bride\" became celebrated, and was depicted in motion pictures as an ''hommage'' in the [[Gloria Swanson]] film, [[Male and Female]], (1919), directed by [[Cecil B. de Mille]].\n\nGabriel von Max was a significant artist to emerge from the Piloty School, because he abandoned the themes of the Grunderzeitliche (genre and history), in order to develop an allegorical-mystical pictorial language, which became typical of [[Secession (art) | Secessionist Art]]. Characteristic of the ethereal style of Gabriel Max is \"The Last Token\" (in the [[Metropolitan Museum]]), and \"Light\" (in the [[Odessa Museum of Western and Eastern Art]], [[Ukraine]]).\n\nThe largest collection of the work of Gabriel von Max in the United States is held by the [[James (Jack) Daulton|Jack Daulton]] Collection in Los Altos Hills, California.\n<gallery widths=\"169px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Gabriel von Max \u00c4ffchen mit Zitrone.jpg|Gabriel von Max: ''\u00c4ffchen mit Zitrone; Sauere Erfahrungen'' (Bitter Experiences), The [[James (Jack) Daulton|Jack Daulton]] Collection, Los Altos Hills, California \nFile:Max Tannh\u00e4user.jpg|''Tannh\u00e4user'' (c. 1878), [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]\nImage:GM-00-Lite.jpg|''Light'' \nFile:Gabriel Max 1866 St Julia img02.jpg|''[[Crucifixion in the arts| Martyress]]''\nFile:Gabriel von Max - Lady Macbeth, 1885.jpg|''[[Lady Macbeth]]''\n \nFile:Gabriel von Max Blonde Frau mit Seidenschleier.jpg|''Blonde Frau mit Seidenschleier - Blonde young girl wiyth a veil.\nFile:Gabriel von Max M\u00e4dchen mit blumengeschm\u00fccktem Haar.jpg|''Young woman with flowers in her hair\nFile:Gabriel von Max - Lesender Affe.jpg|''The reading ape\n \n </gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n \n== Sources ==\n* [[Agathon Klemt]]: ''Gabriel Max und seine Werke'', Gesellschaft f\u00fcr moderne Kunst, Wien 1886\n* [[Nicolaus Mann]]: ''Gabriel Max, eine kulturhistorische Skizze'', Weber, Leipzig 1890\n* [[Franz H.
