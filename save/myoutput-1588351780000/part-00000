With her flamboyant delivery and idiosyncratic banjo-playing, Barry became well known in the pubs and clubs of Irish London, where she was frequently accompanied by the fiddler [[Michael Gorman (musician)|Michael Gorman]]. Barry's singing and banjo playing became a major influence on the younger generation of ballad singers in Ireland and the UK, including [[Luke Kelly]].\n\nOne song for which Barry is particularly noted is \"[[She Moved Through the Fair]]\".
