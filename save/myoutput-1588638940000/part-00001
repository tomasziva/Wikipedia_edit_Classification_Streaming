The recorded history of [[Ohio]] began in the late 17th century when [[French people|French]] explorers from [[Canada]] reached the [[Ohio River]], from which the \"[[Ohio Country]]\" took its name, a river the [[Iroquois]] called ''O-y-o'', \"great river\". Before that, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] speaking [[Algonquin language]]s had inhabited Ohio and the central [[midwestern United States]] for hundreds of years until displaced by the Iroquois in the latter part of the 17th century. Other cultures not generally identified as \"[[Native American peoples|Indians]]\", including the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] \"mound builders\", preceded them. Human history in Ohio began a few millennia after formation of the [[Bering land bridge]] about 14,500BCE - see [[Prehistory of Ohio]].\n\nBy the mid-18th century, a few American and French fur traders engaged historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes in present-day Ohio in the [[fur trade]]. The Native Americans had their own extensive trading networks across the continent before the Europeans arrived. American settlement in the [[Ohio Country]] came after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the formation of the United States, with its takeover of former British territory. Congress prohibited [[slavery]] in the [[Northwest Territory]] which presaged Ohio and the five states of the Territory entering the Union as ''free'' states. Ohio's population increased rapidly after United States victory in the [[Northwest Indian Wars]] brought peace to the Ohio frontier.  In 1803, Ohio was admitted to the union as the 17th state. Settlement was chiefly by migrants from [[New England]], New York and Pennsylvania. Southerners settled along the southern part of the territory, arriving by travel along the Ohio River from the Upper South. Yankees, especially in the \"[[Western reserve]]\" (near Cleveland), supported modernization, [[public education]], and anti-slavery policies. The state supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]], although antiwar [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] sentiment was strong in southern settlements.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Ohio developed as a major industrial state. Ships traveled the [[Great Lakes]] to deliver iron ore and other products from western areas. This was also a route for exports, as were the railroads. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the fast-growing industries created jobs that employed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe. In World War I Europe was closed off to passenger traffic. A new wave of migrants came from the South, with rural whites from Appalachia, and African Americans in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the Deep South, to escape [[Jim Crow]] and violence.\n\nThe cultures of Ohio's major cities became much more diverse with the traditions, cultures, foods, and music of the new arrivals. Ohio's industries were integral to American industrial power in the 20th century. In the later 20th century, economic restructuring in [[steel]], railroads, and other heavy manufacturing cost the state many jobs as [[heavy industry]] declined. The economy in the 21st century has gradually shifted to depend on service industries such as medicine and education.\n\n==Prehistoric period==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Serpent mound 8438.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Serpent Mound]] earthwork in [[Adams County, Ohio|Adams County]]]]\n[[File:Sunwatch Aerial illustration HRoe 2018 400px.jpg|thumb|Artists conception of the [[Fort Ancient]] period [[SunWatch Indian Village]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]]]\n\n{{main|Prehistory of Ohio}}\nA fossil which dated between 11,727 and 11,424 B.C. indicated that Paleo-Indians hunted large animals, including [[Jefferson's ground sloth]], using stone tools.<ref name=cmnh>{{cite web|publisher=[[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]]|url=http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|date=February 2012|access-date=April 12, 2012|title=Research reveals first evidence of hunting by prehistoric Ohioans|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202224/http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|archivedate=May 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Later ancestors of Native Americans were known as the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic peoples]]. Sophisticated successive cultures such as the [[Adena culture|Adena]], [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Fort Ancient]], built monumental [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] such as massive monuments, some of which have survived to the present.\n\nThe Late Archaic period featured the development of focal subsistence economies and regionalization of cultures. Regional cultures in Ohio include the [[Maple Creek Culture]] of southwestern Ohio, the [[Glacial Kame Culture]] of western Ohio (especially northwestern Ohio), and the Red Ochre and Old Copper cultures across much of northern Ohio. Flint Ridge, located in present-day [[Licking County, Ohio|Licking County]], provided [[flint]], an extremely important raw material and trade good. Objects made from Flint Ridge flint have been found as far east as the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, as far west as [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]], and as far south as [[Louisiana]], demonstrating the wide network of prehistoric trading cultures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAbout 800 BC, Late Archaic cultures were supplanted by the [[Adena culture]]. The Adenas were [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]]s. Many of their thousands of mounds in Ohio have survived. Following the Adena culture was the [[Hopewell culture]] (c. 100 to c. 400 C.E.), which also built sophisticated mounds and earthworks, some of which survive at Hopewell and Newark Earthworks. They used their constructions as [[astronomical]] observatories and places of ritual celebration. The [[Fort Ancient culture]] also built mounds, including some [[effigy mounds]]. Researchers first considered the [[Serpent Mound]] in [[Adams County, Ohio]] to be an Adena mound. It is the largest [[effigy mound]] in the United States and one of Ohio's best-known landmarks. Scholars believe it may have been a more recent work of Fort Ancient people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In Southern Ohio alone, archaeologists have pinpointed 10000 mounds used as burial sites and have excavated another 1000 earth-walled enclosures, including one enormous fortification with a circumference of about 3.5 miles, enclosing about 100 acres. We now know from a great variety of items found in the mound tombs - large ceremonial blades chipped from obsidian rock formations in Yellowstone National Park; embossed breast-plates, ornaments and weapons fashioned from copper nuggets from the Great Lakes region; decorative objects cut from sheets of mica from the southern Appalachians; conch shells from the Atlantic seaboard; and ornaments made from shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf of Mexico - that the Mound Builders participated in a vast trading network that linked together hundreds of Native Americans across the continent.<ref>Nash, Gary B.

When the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy depleted the beaver and other game in its territory in the New York region, they launched a war known as the [[Beaver Wars]], destroying or scattering the contemporary inhabitants of the [[Tennessee]] region. During the Beaver Wars in the 1650s, the Iroquois nearly destroyed the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]] along the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. Thereafter, the Iroquois claimed Ohio and West Virginia lands as hunting grounds. For several decades, the land was nearly uninhabited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Beaver Wars===\n{{Main|Beaver Wars}}\nThe land east of the [[Mississippi River]] and south of the [[Great Lakes]] had been fought over for centuries before the [[United States]] government was formed.\n\nIn 1608, [[France|French]] explorer and founder of [[Quebec City]] [[Samuel Champlain]] sided with the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] and their allies the ''[[Wyandot people|Huron]]'' people living along the [[St. Lawrence River]] against the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] (\"Five Nations\") living in what is now upper and western [[New York (state)|New York]] state. The result was a lasting enmity by the Iroquois Confederacy towards the French, which caused them to side with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[fur trader]]s coming up the [[Hudson River]] in about 1626. The Dutch offered better prices than the French and traded [[firearm]]s, [[hatchet]]s and [[knives]] to the Iroquois in exchange for furs.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Josephy |editor-first=Alvin M. |title=The American Heritage Book of Indians |url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage00bran |url-access=registration |publisher=American Heritage Publishing, Co., Inc. |year=1961 |lccn=61-14871}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DefeatOfIroquoisByChamplain.jpeg|thumb|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage, depicting a battle between [[Iroquois]] and [[Algonquian people|Algonquian]] tribes near Lake Champlain]]\n\nWith these more sophisticated weapons, the Five Nations nearly exterminated {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and all of the other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] living immediately to their west in the [[Ohio country]] during the [[Beaver Wars]], beginning in the 1640s. The Native American tribes were competing for hunting grounds for the fur trade. The western tribes had also been weakened by [[epidemics]] of European [[infectious diseases]], against which they had no acquired [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. The Five Nations's use of modern weapons caused the wars to become deadlier. Historians consider the Beaver Wars to have been one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of North America.\n\nAbout 1664, the Five Nations became trading partners with the [[Kingdom of England|British]], who conquered the [[New Netherland]]s (renamed [[New York (state)|New York]]) from the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]].\n\nThe Five Nations enlarged their territory by [[right of conquest]]. The number of tribes paying tribute to them realigned the tribal map of eastern North America. Several large [[Confederation|confederacies]] were destroyed or relocated, including the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]] and [[Shawnee]]. The Five Nations pushed several other eastern tribes to and even across the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Ohio country]] was virtually emptied, as the defeated tribes fled west to escape the Five Nations warriors. After the Five Nations' warriors were defeated, they left much of the [[Northwest territory]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]] almost unpopulated and with abandoned villages. They had claimed the entire Ohio Valley as their own country.\n\nAfter about 1700, some remnants of the Native American tribes began returning to the Northwest Territory. They were often [[conglomerations]] of several tribes who paid tribute to the Five Nations (see also [[Mingo]]).<ref>[http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_44.html ''The Jesuit Relations... 1610-1791''], Creighton University, accessed January 20, 2009</ref>\n\n==European colonization==\n{{Main|Ohio Country}}\n\n===New France===\n[[File:Wpdms ohio country.png|thumb|left|A map of the original [[Ohio Country]].]]\nIn the 17th century, the French were the first modern Europeans to explore what became known as [[Ohio Country]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_YbBqcACm48C&dq The Ohio Country], p. 1.</ref> In 1663, it became part of [[New France]], a royal province of [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], and northeastern Ohio was further explored by [[Robert La Salle]] in 1669.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-uLUVJtHKkC&dq|title=Encyclopedia of the French & Indian War in North America, 1754\u20131763|first=Donald I.|last=Stoetzel|date=August 17, 2017|publisher=Heritage Books|page=371|access-date=August 17, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the [[fur trade]] in the region, linked to their settlements in present-day [[Canada]] and what they called the [[Illinois Country]] along the [[Mississippi River]].

From the east, the [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Shawnee]] arrived, and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] from the north. The [[Miami tribe|Miami]] lived in what is now western Ohio. The [[Mingo]] formed out of Iroquois who migrated west into the Ohio lands, as well as some refugee remnants of other tribes.\n\n[[Christopher Gist]] was one of the first English-speaking explorers to travel through and write about the Ohio Country in 1749. When British traders such as [[George Croghan]] started to do business in the Ohio Country, the French and their northern Indian allies drove them out. In 1752 the French raided the [[Miami]] Indian town of ''Pickawillany'' (modern [[Piqua, Ohio]]). The French began military occupation of the Ohio Valley in 1753.\n\n====French and Indian War====\nBy the mid-18th century, British traders were rivaling French traders in the area.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mum6vMM5YwC&dq The great frontier war: Britain, France, and the imperial struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755], p. 177</ref> They had occupied a trading post called [[Fort Loramie|Loramie's Fort]], which the French attacked from Canada in 1752, renaming it for a Frenchman named Loramie and establishing a trading post there. In the early 1750s [[George Washington]] was sent to the Ohio Country by the [[Ohio Company]] to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark the [[French and Indian War]]. It was in the Ohio Country where George Washington lost the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]] to [[Louis Coulon de Villiers]] in 1754, and the subsequent [[Battle of the Monongahela]] to Charles Michel de Langlade and Jean-Daniel Dumas to retake the country 1755.\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the country to [[First British Empire|Great Britain]] in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring among the tribes.\n\n===British Empire===\nPrior to the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts.<ref>The last French Fort in Ohio Country, Fort Sandusky, was destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion.</ref> Just beyond Ohio Country was the great [[Miami Tribe|Miami]] capital of [[Kekionga]] which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future [[Northwest Territory]]. By the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], British lands west of [[Appalachia]] were forbidden to settlement by colonists.  The [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Indian lands. British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763. Ohio Indians participated in that war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought [[Lord Dunmore's War]] to a conclusion. Lord Dunmore constructed [[Fort Gower]] on the [[Hocking River]] in 1774.<ref name=OH />\n\n===American Revolution===\nAs a result of the exploits of George Rogers Clark in 1778, Ohio Country (including the territory of the future state of Ohio) as well as eastern Illinois Country, became Illinois County, Virginia by claim of conquest under the Virginia Colony charter.

For example, the Shawnee leader [[Blue Jacket]] and the Delaware leader ''[[Buckongahelas]]'' sided with the British. [[Cornstalk]] (Shawnee) and [[White Eyes]] (Delaware) sought to remain friendly with the rebellious colonists. There was major fighting in 1782.<ref>Milo Milton Quaife, \"The Ohio Campaigns of 1782.\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1931): 515\u2013529. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1916389 in JSTOR]</ref> American colonial frontiersmen often did not differentiate between friendly and hostile Indians, however. Cornstalk was killed by American militiamen, and White Eyes may have been. One of the most tragic incidents of the war \u2014 the killing of 96 Christian Delaware by U.S. militiamen from Pennsylvania on March 8, 1782 at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, known as the [[Gnadenhutten massacre]] \u2014 took place in Ohio.<ref>Rob Harper, \"Looking the other way: the Gnadenhutten massacre and the contextual interpretation of violence.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2007): 621\u2013644.

Though Crawford was not at Gnadenhutten, in revenge, he was tortured for hours then burned at the stake.\n\nWith the American victory in the Revolutionary War, the British ceded claims to Ohio and its territory in the West as far as the [[Mississippi River]] to the new nation. Between 1784 and 1789, the states of Virginia, [[Massachusetts]] and Connecticut ceded their earlier land claims in Ohio Country to Congress, but Virginia and Connecticut maintained reserves.<ref>Kip Sperry, ''Genealogical Research in Ohio'', Genealogical Publishing, 2003, p.2</ref> These areas were known as the [[Virginia Military District]] and [[Connecticut Western Reserve]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard Peacefull|title=A Geography of Ohio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gefpsoo1nRIC&pg=PA89|year=1996|publisher=Kent State University Press|page=89}}</ref><ref>Harlan Hatcher, ''The Western Reserve: The Story of New Connecticut in Ohio'' (1949)</ref>\n\n==Territory and statehood==\n===Northwest Territory===\nStarting even before the war, and accelerating with the establishment of Fort Henry across the Ohio River in West Virginia, numerous settlers encroached on Indian lands west of the Ohio River in a broad arc from west of Fort Henry as far upriver as where Fort Steuben (today Steubenville) was later established. That there was continuous occupation of such lands is certain, though the location and continuity of any particular settlement, at least a few of which were referred to loosely as \"towns\" is very much in doubt. Most prominent among these were a series of squatters settlements with various names circa 1774 to 1795 in the area of what is today Martin's Ferry, directly across river from Fort Henry.

The [[Connecticut Land Company]] administered settlement in the Connecticut [[Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Northeast Ohio]]. A heavy flood of migrants came from New York and especially New England, where there had been a growing hunger for land as population increased before the Revolutionary War. Most traveled to Ohio by [[wagon]] and [[stagecoach]], following former Indian paths such as the [[Northern Trace]]. Many also traveled part of the way by barges on the [[Mohawk River]] across New York state. Farmers who settled in western New York after the war sometimes moved on to one or more locations in Ohio in their lifetimes, as new lands kept opening to the west.\n\nAmerican settlement of the [[Northwest Territory]] was resisted by Native Americans in the [[Northwest Indian War]]. The natives were eventually conquered by General [[Anthony Wayne]] at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. They ceded much of present-day Ohio to the United States by the [[Treaty of Greenville]], concluded in 1795.\n\nFurthermore, in regards to the [[Leni Lenape]] Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the [[Muskingum River]] in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the [[Moravian Brethren]] ... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774\u201389|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=April 11, 2012}}{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] prohibited [[slavery]] in the territory.  (Once the population grew and the territory achieved statehood, the citizens could have legalized slavery, but chose not to do so.)  The states of the Midwest would be known as Free States, in contrast to those states south of the Ohio River. Migrants to the latter came chiefly from [[Virginia]] and other slave-holding states, and brought their culture and slaves with them.\n\nAs Northeastern states abolished [[slavery]] in the coming two generations, the free states would be known as Northern States. The [[Northwest Territory]] originally included areas previously called [[Ohio Country]] and [[Illinois Country]]. As Ohio prepared for statehood, [[Indiana Territory]] was carved out, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of [[Michigan]]'s lower peninsula and a sliver of land in southeastern Indiana along Ohio's western border called \"The Gore\".\n\n===Statehood===\n[[File:Land patent-ohio-logan-co-1834-henry-hanford.gif|thumb|300px|Land patent.

The assumption was the territory would have in excess of the required 60,000 residents by the time it became a state. Congress passed the [[Enabling Act of 1802]] that outlined the process for Ohio to seek statehood. The residents convened a constitutional convention. They used numerous provisions from other states and rejected slavery.\n\nOn February 19, 1803, [[Thomas Jefferson|President Jefferson]] signed the act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. Congress did not pass a specific resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress' declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, when [[Louisiana]] was admitted as the 18th state.\n\n===War of 1812===\n{{see also|Ohio in the War of 1812}}\n\nOhio played a key role in the [[War of 1812]], as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in [[Lake Erie]].

Seeing the need to replace steel-rimmed carriage tires with rubber, [[Harvey Firestone]] started [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]] and began selling to [[Henry Ford]]. The Ohio Automobile Company eventually became known as [[Packard]], while [[Benjamin Goodrich]] entered the rubber industry in 1870 in Akron, founding Goodrich, Tew & Company, better known as the [[Goodrich Corporation]] in the present era.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Ohio had become a global industrial center.<ref name=OTH>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tC9d4JVvefIC&dq Ohio: the history of a people], p. 180</ref> Natural resources contributed to the industrial growth, including salt, iron ore, timber, limestone, coal, and natural gas, and the discovery of oil in northwestern Ohio led to the growth of the port of Toledo.<ref name=OTH /> By 1908, the state had 9,581 miles of railroad linking coal mines, oil fields, and industries with the world.<ref name=OTH /> Commercial enterprise began to prosper around towns with banks.<ref name=OTH />\n\n===Innovation===\n[[William Procter (candlemaker)|William Procter]] and [[James Gamble (industrialist)|James Gamble]] started a company which produced a high quality, inexpensive soap called [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory]], which is still the best known product today of [[Procter and Gamble]].

By the late 1810s, the [[National Road]] crossed the [[Appalachian Mountains]], connecting Ohio with the east coast. The [[Ohio River]] aided the agricultural economy by allowing farmers to move their goods by water to the southern states and the port of [[New Orleans]]. The construction of the [[Erie Canal]] in the 1820s allowed Ohio businesses to ship their goods through [[Lake Erie]] and to the east coast, which was followed by the completion of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and the connection of Lake Erie with the Ohio River. This gave the state complete water access to the world within the borders of the [[United States]]. Other canals included [[Miami and Erie Canal]].<ref name=EI>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1562|title=Early Industrialization \u2013 Ohio History Central|author=|date=|website=www.OhioHistoryCentral.org|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> The [[Welland Canal]] would eventually give the state alternative global routes through Canada.\n\nThe first railroad in Ohio was a 33-mile line completed in 1836 called the [[Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad]], connecting Toledo with [[Adrian, Michigan]]. The [[Ohio Loan Law of 1837]] allowed the state to loan one-third of construction costs to businesses, passed initially to aid the construction of canals, but instead used heavily for the construction of railroads. The [[Little Miami Railroad]] was granted a state charter in 1836 and was completed in 1848, connecting Cincinnati with [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]]. Construction of a commuter rail began in 1851 called the [[Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (1846\u20131917)|Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad]]. This allowed the affluent of Cincinnati to move to newly developed communities outside the city along the rail. The [[Ohio and Mississippi Railroad]] was given financial support from the city of Cincinnati and eventually connected them with [[St. Louis]], while the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] crossed the Appalachians in the mid-1850s and connected the state with the east coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=794|title=Railroads \u2013 Ohio History Central|author=|date=|website=OhioHistoryCentral.org|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe investment in infrastructure complemented Ohio's central location and put it at the heart of the nation's transportation system traveling north and south and east and west, and also gave the state a headstart during the national industrialization process which occurred between 1870 and 1920.<ref name=\"OW\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtzg_mri498C&dq|title=Ohio and the World, 1753\u20132053: Essays Toward a New History of Ohio|first1=Geoffrey|last1=Parker|first2=Richard|last2=Sisson|first3=William Russell|last3=Coil|date=August 17, 2017|publisher=Ohio State University Press|pages=98\u201399|accessdate=August 17, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nWater ports sprang up along [[Lake Erie]], including the [[Ashtabula, Ohio|Port of Ashtabula]], [[Port of Cleveland]], [[Conneaut, Ohio|Port of Conneaut]], [[Fairport Harbor]], [[Huron, Ohio|Port of Huron]], [[Lorain, Ohio|Port of Lorain]], [[Marblehead, Ohio|Port of Marblehead]], [[Sandusky, Ohio|Port of Sandusky]], and [[Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority|Port of Toledo]]. The Port of Cincinnati was built on the [[Ohio River]].\n\nFollowing the commercialization of air travel, Ohio became a key route for east to west transportation. The [[Columbus, ohio#Aviation|first commercial cargo flight]] occurred between Dayton and Columbus in 1910. [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] was built in 1925 and became home to the first air traffic control tower, ground to air radio control, airfield lighting system, and commuter rail link.\n\nThe [[Interstate Highway System]] brought new travel routes to the state in the mid-20th century, further making Ohio a transportation hub.\n\n===Urbanization and commercialization===\nWith the rapid increase of industrialization in the country in the late 19th century, Ohio's population swelled from 2.3 million in 1860 to 4.2 million by 1900. By 1920, nine Ohio cities had populations of 50,000 or more.<ref name=OW />\n\nThe rapid urbanization brought about a growth of commercial industries in the state, including many financial and insurance institutions. The [[National City Corporation]] was founded in 1845, today part of [[PNC Financial Services]]. Cleveland's Society for Savings was founded in 1849, eventually becoming part of [[KeyBank]]. The Bank of the Ohio Valley opened in 1858, becoming known as [[Fifth Third Bank]] today. City National Bank and Trust Company was founded in 1866 in Columbus, eventually becoming [[Bank One]]. The [[American Financial Group]] was founded in 1872 and the [[Western & Southern Financial Group]] in 1888 in Cincinnati. The Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company was founded in Columbus in 1925, today known as the [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]].\n\nMajor retail operations emerged in the state, including [[Kroger]] in 1883 in Cincinnati, today second only to [[Walmart]]. [[Federated Department Stores]] was founded in Columbus in 1929, known today as Macy's.

With so many active denominations, no one dominated and, increasingly, tolerance became the norm. Germans from Pennsylvania and from Germany brought Lutheran and Reformed churches and numerous smaller sects such as the Amish. Yankees brought Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Revivals during the [[Second Great Awakening]] spurred the growth of Methodist, Baptist and Christian (Church of Christ) churches. The building of many denominational liberal arts colleges was a distinctive feature of the 19th century. By the 1840s German and Irish Catholics were moving into the cities, and after the 1880s Catholics from eastern and southern Europe arrived in the larger cities, mining camps, and small industrial centers. Jews and Eastern Orthodox settlements added to the pluralism, as did the building of black Baptists and Methodist churches in the cities.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3169028 Timothy L.

Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular location \u2013 or \"market-minded agrarianism\" \u2013 and worked hard to provide for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.<ref>Ginette Aley, \"A Republic of Farm People: Women, Families, and Market-Minded Agrarianism in Ohio, 1820s\u20131830s,\" ''Ohio History,'' (2007) 114#1 pp 28\u201345, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ohh/summary/v114/114.aley.html online]</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of [[German Americans]] arrived from Pennsylvania, augmented by new immigrants from Germany. They all clung to their German language and Protestant religions, as well as their specialized tastes in food and beer. Brewing was a main feature of the German culture. Their villages from this period included the [[German Village]] in Columbus. They also founded the villages of [[Gnadenhutten, Ohio|Gnadenhutten]] in the late 18th century; [[Bergholz, Ohio|Bergholz]], [[New Bremen, Ohio|New Bremen]], [[North Canton, Ohio|New Berlin]], [[Dresden, Ohio|Dresden]], and other villages and towns.

Starting this invention in their bike shop in what is now Dayton's west side, the Wright's brought flight to the world in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. \nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[14] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.

Due to its central location and burgeoning population, Ohio was both politically and logistically important to the war effort. Despite the state's boasting a number of very powerful [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians, it was divided politically.  Portions of Southern Ohio followed the [[Peace Democrats]] under [[Clement Vallandigham]] and openly opposed President Lincoln's policies. Ohio played an important part in the [[Underground Railroad]] prior to the war, and remained a haven for escaped and runaway slaves during the war years.<ref>Robert S.

Several reasons came together. Ohio was a microcosm of the United States, balanced closely between the parties, and at the crossroads of America: between the South, the Northeast, and the developing West, and influenced by each. Its ethnic, religious, and cultural elements were a microcosm of the North. Its cutthroat politics trained candidates in how to win. A leading Ohio politician was \"Available\"\u2014that is, well-suited and electable. Thus, in most presidential years, the governor of Ohio was deemed more available than the governor of the larger states of New York or Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Sinclair|1965|pp=28\u201330}}\n\nThis legend built on itself as the state sent seven men to the White House and four more became vice president. Many others won major patronage plums. Between 1868 and 1924, not only did Ohio supply the most presidents, it supplied the most Cabinet members, and the most federal officeholders. Ohio-born [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] (1876), [[James A. Garfield]] (1880) and [[Benjamin Harrison]] (1888) were each nominated from a convention that had deadlocked, and where the delegates chose to turn to a candidate who could carry Ohio. In each case they did, and won the presidency. According to historian Andrew Sinclair, \"the potency of the Ohio myth gave its [[favorite son]]s a huge advantage in a deadlocked convention\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Sinclair|title=The Available Man: The Life behind the Masks of Warren Gamaliel Harding|url=https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc |url-access=registration |year=1965|pages=[https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc/page/28 28\u201330]|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Progressive era===\n[[File:Fairbanks 4408868314 de2f1cd85b o.jpg|thumb|left|175px|U.S. Second Lady [[Cornelia Cole Fairbanks]] was a powerful progressive operative around the start of the 20th century who helped pave the way for the modern American female politician.]]\nThe [[Progressive Era]] brought about change in the state, although the state had been at the forefront of the movement decades before.

The result reflected the concerns of the [[Progressive Era]]. The constitution introduced the [[initiative]] and the [[referendum]], and provided for the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear every 20 years on Ohio's general election ballots. The question asks whether a new constitutional convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, the people have not found the need for a convention. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition and the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.\n\n===Ku Klux Klan===\nIn the early 1920s the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted thousands of Protestant men into membership, warning of the need to purify America, especially against the influence of Catholics, bootleggers, and corrupt politicians.

The recorded history of [[Ohio]] began in the late 17th century when [[French people|French]] explorers from [[Canada]] reached the [[Ohio River]], from which the \"[[Ohio Country]]\" took its name, a river the [[Iroquois]] called ''O-y-o'', \"great river\". Before that, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] speaking [[Algonquin language]]s had inhabited Ohio and the central [[midwestern United States]] for hundreds of years until displaced by the Iroquois in the latter part of the 17th century. Other cultures not generally identified as \"[[Native American peoples|Indians]]\", including the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] \"mound builders\", preceded them. Human history in Ohio began a few millennia after formation of the [[Bering land bridge]] about 14,500BCE - see [[Prehistory of Ohio]].\n\nBy the mid-18th century, a few American and French fur traders engaged historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes in present-day Ohio in the [[fur trade]]. The Native Americans had their own extensive trading networks across the continent before the Europeans arrived. American settlement in the [[Ohio Country]] came after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the formation of the United States, with its takeover of former British territory. Congress prohibited [[slavery]] in the [[Northwest Territory]] which presaged Ohio and the five states of the Territory entering the Union as ''free'' states. Ohio's population increased rapidly after United States victory in the [[Northwest Indian Wars]] brought peace to the Ohio frontier.  In 1803, Ohio was admitted to the union as the 17th state. Settlement was chiefly by migrants from [[New England]], New York and Pennsylvania. Southerners settled along the southern part of the territory, arriving by travel along the Ohio River from the Upper South. Yankees, especially in the \"[[Western reserve]]\" (near Cleveland), supported modernization, [[public education]], and anti-slavery policies. The state supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]], although antiwar [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] sentiment was strong in southern settlements.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Ohio developed as a major industrial state. Ships traveled the [[Great Lakes]] to deliver iron ore and other products from western areas. This was also a route for exports, as were the railroads. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the fast-growing industries created jobs that employed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe. In World War I Europe was closed off to passenger traffic. A new wave of migrants came from the South, with rural whites from Appalachia, and African Americans in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the Deep South, to escape [[Jim Crow]] and violence.\n\nThe cultures of Ohio's major cities became much more diverse with the traditions, cultures, foods, and music of the new arrivals. Ohio's industries were integral to American industrial power in the 20th century. In the later 20th century, economic restructuring in [[steel]], railroads, and other heavy manufacturing cost the state many jobs as [[heavy industry]] declined. The economy in the 21st century has gradually shifted to depend on service industries such as medicine and education.\n\n==Prehistoric period==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Serpent mound 8438.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Serpent Mound]] earthwork in [[Adams County, Ohio|Adams County]]]]\n[[File:Sunwatch Aerial illustration HRoe 2018 400px.jpg|thumb|Artists conception of the [[Fort Ancient]] period [[SunWatch Indian Village]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]]]\n\n{{main|Prehistory of Ohio}}\nA fossil which dated between 11,727 and 11,424 B.C. indicated that Paleo-Indians hunted large animals, including [[Jefferson's ground sloth]], using stone tools.<ref name=cmnh>{{cite web|publisher=[[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]]|url=http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|date=February 2012|access-date=April 12, 2012|title=Research reveals first evidence of hunting by prehistoric Ohioans|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202224/http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|archivedate=May 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Later ancestors of Native Americans were known as the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic peoples]]. Sophisticated successive cultures such as the [[Adena culture|Adena]], [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Fort Ancient]], built monumental [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] such as massive monuments, some of which have survived to the present.\n\nThe Late Archaic period featured the development of focal subsistence economies and regionalization of cultures. Regional cultures in Ohio include the [[Maple Creek Culture]] of southwestern Ohio, the [[Glacial Kame Culture]] of western Ohio (especially northwestern Ohio), and the Red Ochre and Old Copper cultures across much of northern Ohio. Flint Ridge, located in present-day [[Licking County, Ohio|Licking County]], provided [[flint]], an extremely important raw material and trade good. Objects made from Flint Ridge flint have been found as far east as the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, as far west as [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]], and as far south as [[Louisiana]], demonstrating the wide network of prehistoric trading cultures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAbout 800 BC, Late Archaic cultures were supplanted by the [[Adena culture]]. The Adenas were [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]]s. Many of their thousands of mounds in Ohio have survived. Following the Adena culture was the [[Hopewell culture]] (c. 100 to c. 400 C.E.), which also built sophisticated mounds and earthworks, some of which survive at Hopewell and Newark Earthworks. They used their constructions as [[astronomical]] observatories and places of ritual celebration. The [[Fort Ancient culture]] also built mounds, including some [[effigy mounds]]. Researchers first considered the [[Serpent Mound]] in [[Adams County, Ohio]] to be an Adena mound. It is the largest [[effigy mound]] in the United States and one of Ohio's best-known landmarks. Scholars believe it may have been a more recent work of Fort Ancient people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In Southern Ohio alone, archaeologists have pinpointed 10000 mounds used as burial sites and have excavated another 1000 earth-walled enclosures, including one enormous fortification with a circumference of about 3.5 miles, enclosing about 100 acres. We now know from a great variety of items found in the mound tombs - large ceremonial blades chipped from obsidian rock formations in Yellowstone National Park; embossed breast-plates, ornaments and weapons fashioned from copper nuggets from the Great Lakes region; decorative objects cut from sheets of mica from the southern Appalachians; conch shells from the Atlantic seaboard; and ornaments made from shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf of Mexico - that the Mound Builders participated in a vast trading network that linked together hundreds of Native Americans across the continent.<ref>Nash, Gary B.

When the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy depleted the beaver and other game in its territory in the New York region, they launched a war known as the [[Beaver Wars]], destroying or scattering the contemporary inhabitants of the [[Tennessee]] region. During the Beaver Wars in the 1650s, the Iroquois nearly destroyed the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]] along the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. Thereafter, the Iroquois claimed Ohio and West Virginia lands as hunting grounds. For several decades, the land was nearly uninhabited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Beaver Wars===\n{{Main|Beaver Wars}}\nThe land east of the [[Mississippi River]] and south of the [[Great Lakes]] had been fought over for centuries before the [[United States]] government was formed.\n\nIn 1608, [[France|French]] explorer and founder of [[Quebec City]] [[Samuel Champlain]] sided with the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] and their allies the ''[[Wyandot people|Huron]]'' people living along the [[St. Lawrence River]] against the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] (\"Five Nations\") living in what is now upper and western [[New York (state)|New York]] state. The result was a lasting enmity by the Iroquois Confederacy towards the French, which caused them to side with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[fur trader]]s coming up the [[Hudson River]] in about 1626. The Dutch offered better prices than the French and traded [[firearm]]s, [[hatchet]]s and [[knives]] to the Iroquois in exchange for furs.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Josephy |editor-first=Alvin M. |title=The American Heritage Book of Indians |url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage00bran |url-access=registration |publisher=American Heritage Publishing, Co., Inc. |year=1961 |lccn=61-14871}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DefeatOfIroquoisByChamplain.jpeg|thumb|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage, depicting a battle between [[Iroquois]] and [[Algonquian people|Algonquian]] tribes near Lake Champlain]]\n\nWith these more sophisticated weapons, the Five Nations nearly exterminated {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and all of the other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] living immediately to their west in the [[Ohio country]] during the [[Beaver Wars]], beginning in the 1640s. The Native American tribes were competing for hunting grounds for the fur trade. The western tribes had also been weakened by [[epidemics]] of European [[infectious diseases]], against which they had no acquired [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. The Five Nations's use of modern weapons caused the wars to become deadlier. Historians consider the Beaver Wars to have been one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of North America.\n\nAbout 1664, the Five Nations became trading partners with the [[Kingdom of England|British]], who conquered the [[New Netherland]]s (renamed [[New York (state)|New York]]) from the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]].\n\nThe Five Nations enlarged their territory by [[right of conquest]]. The number of tribes paying tribute to them realigned the tribal map of eastern North America. Several large [[Confederation|confederacies]] were destroyed or relocated, including the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]] and [[Shawnee]]. The Five Nations pushed several other eastern tribes to and even across the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Ohio country]] was virtually emptied, as the defeated tribes fled west to escape the Five Nations warriors. After the Five Nations' warriors were defeated, they left much of the [[Northwest territory]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]] almost unpopulated and with abandoned villages. They had claimed the entire Ohio Valley as their own country.\n\nAfter about 1700, some remnants of the Native American tribes began returning to the Northwest Territory. They were often [[conglomerations]] of several tribes who paid tribute to the Five Nations (see also [[Mingo]]).<ref>[http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_44.html ''The Jesuit Relations... 1610-1791''], Creighton University, accessed January 20, 2009</ref>\n\n==European colonization==\n{{Main|Ohio Country}}\n\n===New France===\n[[File:Wpdms ohio country.png|thumb|left|A map of the original [[Ohio Country]].]]\nIn the 17th century, the French were the first modern Europeans to explore what became known as [[Ohio Country]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_YbBqcACm48C&dq The Ohio Country], p. 1.</ref> In 1663, it became part of [[New France]], a royal province of [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], and northeastern Ohio was further explored by [[Robert La Salle]] in 1669.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-uLUVJtHKkC&dq|title=Encyclopedia of the French & Indian War in North America, 1754\u20131763|first=Donald I.|last=Stoetzel|date=August 17, 2017|publisher=Heritage Books|page=371|access-date=August 17, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the [[fur trade]] in the region, linked to their settlements in present-day [[Canada]] and what they called the [[Illinois Country]] along the [[Mississippi River]].

From the east, the [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Shawnee]] arrived, and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] from the north. The [[Miami tribe|Miami]] lived in what is now western Ohio. The [[Mingo]] formed out of Iroquois who migrated west into the Ohio lands, as well as some refugee remnants of other tribes.\n\n[[Christopher Gist]] was one of the first English-speaking explorers to travel through and write about the Ohio Country in 1749. When British traders such as [[George Croghan]] started to do business in the Ohio Country, the French and their northern Indian allies drove them out. In 1752 the French raided the [[Miami]] Indian town of ''Pickawillany'' (modern [[Piqua, Ohio]]). The French began military occupation of the Ohio Valley in 1753.\n\n====French and Indian War====\nBy the mid-18th century, British traders were rivaling French traders in the area.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mum6vMM5YwC&dq The great frontier war: Britain, France, and the imperial struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755], p. 177</ref> They had occupied a trading post called [[Fort Loramie|Loramie's Fort]], which the French attacked from Canada in 1752, renaming it for a Frenchman named Loramie and establishing a trading post there. In the early 1750s [[George Washington]] was sent to the Ohio Country by the [[Ohio Company]] to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark the [[French and Indian War]]. It was in the Ohio Country where George Washington lost the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]] to [[Louis Coulon de Villiers]] in 1754, and the subsequent [[Battle of the Monongahela]] to Charles Michel de Langlade and Jean-Daniel Dumas to retake the country 1755.\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the country to [[First British Empire|Great Britain]] in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring among the tribes.\n\n===British Empire===\nPrior to the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts.<ref>The last French Fort in Ohio Country, Fort Sandusky, was destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion.</ref> Just beyond Ohio Country was the great [[Miami Tribe|Miami]] capital of [[Kekionga]] which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future [[Northwest Territory]]. By the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], British lands west of [[Appalachia]] were forbidden to settlement by colonists.  The [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Indian lands. British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763. Ohio Indians participated in that war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought [[Lord Dunmore's War]] to a conclusion. Lord Dunmore constructed [[Fort Gower]] on the [[Hocking River]] in 1774.<ref name=OH />\n\n===American Revolution===\nAs a result of the exploits of George Rogers Clark in 1778, Ohio Country (including the territory of the future state of Ohio) as well as eastern Illinois Country, became Illinois County, Virginia by claim of conquest under the Virginia Colony charter. The county was dissolved in 1782 and ceded to the United States.\n\n[[File:Gnadenhutten monument.JPG|thumb|right|Monument commemorating the [[Moravian Massacre]] in 1782 near the [[German American]] settlement of [[Gnadenhutten, Ohio|Gnadenhutten]].]]\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], Native Americans in the Ohio Country were divided over which side to support. For example, the Shawnee leader [[Blue Jacket]] and the Delaware leader ''[[Buckongahelas]]'' sided with the British. [[Cornstalk]] (Shawnee) and [[White Eyes]] (Delaware) sought to remain friendly with the rebellious colonists. There was major fighting in 1782.<ref>Milo Milton Quaife, \"The Ohio Campaigns of 1782.\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1931): 515\u2013529.

Cornstalk was killed by American militiamen, and White Eyes may have been. One of the most tragic incidents of the war \u2014 the killing of 96 Christian Delaware by U.S. militiamen from Pennsylvania on March 8, 1782 at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, known as the [[Gnadenhutten massacre]] \u2014 took place in Ohio.<ref>Rob Harper, \"Looking the other way: the Gnadenhutten massacre and the contextual interpretation of violence.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2007): 621\u2013644.

Though Crawford was not at Gnadenhutten, in revenge, he was tortured for hours then burned at the stake.\n\nWith the American victory in the Revolutionary War, the British ceded claims to Ohio and its territory in the West as far as the [[Mississippi River]] to the new nation. Between 1784 and 1789, the states of Virginia, [[Massachusetts]] and Connecticut ceded their earlier land claims in Ohio Country to Congress, but Virginia and Connecticut maintained reserves.<ref>Kip Sperry, ''Genealogical Research in Ohio'', Genealogical Publishing, 2003, p.2</ref> These areas were known as the [[Virginia Military District]] and [[Connecticut Western Reserve]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard Peacefull|title=A Geography of Ohio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gefpsoo1nRIC&pg=PA89|year=1996|publisher=Kent State University Press|page=89}}</ref><ref>Harlan Hatcher, ''The Western Reserve: The Story of New Connecticut in Ohio'' (1949)</ref>\n\n==Territory and statehood==\n===Northwest Territory===\nStarting even before the war, and accelerating with the establishment of Fort Henry across the Ohio River in West Virginia, numerous settlers encroached on Indian lands west of the Ohio River in a broad arc from west of Fort Henry as far upriver as where Fort Steuben (today Steubenville) was later established. That there was continuous occupation of such lands is certain, though the location and continuity of any particular settlement, at least a few of which were referred to loosely as \"towns\" is very much in doubt. Most prominent among these were a series of squatters settlements with various names circa 1774 to 1795 in the area of what is today Martin's Ferry, directly across river from Fort Henry.

The [[Connecticut Land Company]] administered settlement in the Connecticut [[Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Northeast Ohio]]. A heavy flood of migrants came from New York and especially New England, where there had been a growing hunger for land as population increased before the Revolutionary War. Most traveled to Ohio by [[wagon]] and [[stagecoach]], following former Indian paths such as the [[Northern Trace]]. Many also traveled part of the way by barges on the [[Mohawk River]] across New York state. Farmers who settled in western New York after the war sometimes moved on to one or more locations in Ohio in their lifetimes, as new lands kept opening to the west.\n\nAmerican settlement of the [[Northwest Territory]] was resisted by Native Americans in the [[Northwest Indian War]]. The natives were eventually conquered by General [[Anthony Wayne]] at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. They ceded much of present-day Ohio to the United States by the [[Treaty of Greenville]], concluded in 1795.\n\nFurthermore, in regards to the [[Leni Lenape]] Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the [[Muskingum River]] in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the [[Moravian Brethren]] ... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774\u201389|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=April 11, 2012}}{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] prohibited [[slavery]] in the territory.  (Once the population grew and the territory achieved statehood, the citizens could have legalized slavery, but chose not to do so.)  The states of the Midwest would be known as Free States, in contrast to those states south of the Ohio River. Migrants to the latter came chiefly from [[Virginia]] and other slave-holding states, and brought their culture and slaves with them.\n\nAs Northeastern states abolished [[slavery]] in the coming two generations, the free states would be known as Northern States. The [[Northwest Territory]] originally included areas previously called [[Ohio Country]] and [[Illinois Country]]. As Ohio prepared for statehood, [[Indiana Territory]] was carved out, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of [[Michigan]]'s lower peninsula and a sliver of land in southeastern Indiana along Ohio's western border called \"The Gore\".\n\n===Statehood===\n[[File:Land patent-ohio-logan-co-1834-henry-hanford.gif|thumb|300px|Land patent.

The assumption was the territory would have in excess of the required 60,000 residents by the time it became a state. Congress passed the [[Enabling Act of 1802]] that outlined the process for Ohio to seek statehood. The residents convened a constitutional convention. They used numerous provisions from other states and rejected slavery.\n\nOn February 19, 1803, [[Thomas Jefferson|President Jefferson]] signed the act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. Congress did not pass a specific resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress' declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, when [[Louisiana]] was admitted as the 18th state.\n\n===War of 1812===\n{{see also|Ohio in the War of 1812}}\n\nOhio played a key role in the [[War of 1812]], as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in [[Lake Erie]]. On September 10, 1813, the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], one of the major battles, took place in Lake Erie near [[Put-in-Bay, Ohio]].

With so many active denominations, no one dominated and, increasingly, tolerance became the norm. Germans from Pennsylvania and from Germany brought Lutheran and Reformed churches and numerous smaller sects such as the Amish. Yankees brought Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Revivals during the [[Second Great Awakening]] spurred the growth of Methodist, Baptist and Christian (Church of Christ) churches. The building of many denominational liberal arts colleges was a distinctive feature of the 19th century. By the 1840s German and Irish Catholics were moving into the cities, and after the 1880s Catholics from eastern and southern Europe arrived in the larger cities, mining camps, and small industrial centers. Jews and Eastern Orthodox settlements added to the pluralism, as did the building of black Baptists and Methodist churches in the cities.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3169028 Timothy L.

He was the editor of the influential national magazine the ''Independent'' after 1871, and as pastor of the First Congregational Church of Columbus, Ohio from 1882 to his death in 1918.

Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular location \u2013 or \"market-minded agrarianism\" \u2013 and worked hard to provide for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.<ref>Ginette Aley, \"A Republic of Farm People: Women, Families, and Market-Minded Agrarianism in Ohio, 1820s\u20131830s,\" ''Ohio History,'' (2007) 114#1 pp 28\u201345, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ohh/summary/v114/114.aley.html online]</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of [[German Americans]] arrived from Pennsylvania, augmented by new immigrants from Germany. They all clung to their German language and Protestant religions, as well as their specialized tastes in food and beer. Brewing was a main feature of the German culture. Their villages from this period included the [[German Village]] in Columbus. They also founded the villages of [[Gnadenhutten, Ohio|Gnadenhutten]] in the late 18th century; [[Bergholz, Ohio|Bergholz]], [[New Bremen, Ohio|New Bremen]], [[North Canton, Ohio|New Berlin]], [[Dresden, Ohio|Dresden]], and other villages and towns. The German Americans immigrating from the Mid-Atlantic states, especially eastern Pennsylvania, brought with them the [[Philadelphia dialect|Midland dialect]], which is still found throughout much of Ohio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evolpub.com/Americandialects/PennaDialMap.html|title=Linguistic Geography of Pennsylvania|author=|date=|website=www.Evolpub.com|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/dialectsofenglish.html|title=Dialects of English|first=C.

The [[Forty-Eighters]] from Central Europe settled the [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood in Cincinnati, while the Irish immigrants settled throughout the state, including [[Flytown]] in Columbus. Other immigrants from [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Poland]], and other places came in the latter years.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3Xn7jMx1RYC ''The American Midwest: an interpretive encyclopedia''], p. 228\u2013231</ref> Around the start of the 20th century, rural southern [[European Americans]] and [[African Americans]] came north in search of better economic opportunity, infusing [[Hillbilly]] culture into the state. Newer ethnic villages emerged, including the [[Slavic Village]] in Cleveland and the [[Italian Village, Columbus, Ohio|Italian Village]] and [[Hungarian Village]] in Columbus. [[Howard Chandler Christy]], born in [[Morgan County, Ohio|Morgan County]], became a leading American artist during this century, as well as composer [[Dan Emmett]], founder of the [[Blackface]] tradition.\nOhio's mines factories and cities attracted Europeans.

Athletics became increasingly popular as the first professional baseball team, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], started playing at that level in 1869, and football leagues emerged. Bathhouses and rollercoasters became a popular past time with the opening of [[Cedar Point]] in 1870.

However these organizations steadily lost influence after 1925.\n\nPerhaps the biggest invention in Ohio and the US was the invention of flight by Dayton's [[Orville and Wilbur Wright]]. Starting this invention in their bike shop in what is now Dayton's west side, the Wright's brought flight to the world in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. \nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[14] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers. The very first airplane passenger was the Wright's own mechanic, [[Charles Furnas]] of [[West Milton, Ohio]].\n\n===Depression years===\nDuring the 1930s, the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] struck the state hard. American Jews watched the rise of the [[Third Reich]] with apprehension.

[[Alan Freed]], who emerged from the swing dance culture in Cleveland, hosted the first live rock 'n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952.

Due to its central location and burgeoning population, Ohio was both politically and logistically important to the war effort. Despite the state's boasting a number of very powerful [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians, it was divided politically.  Portions of Southern Ohio followed the [[Peace Democrats]] under [[Clement Vallandigham]] and openly opposed President Lincoln's policies. Ohio played an important part in the [[Underground Railroad]] prior to the war, and remained a haven for escaped and runaway slaves during the war years.<ref>Robert S.

Ohio resident [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] wrote the famous book ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was largely influential in shaping the opinion of the north against slavery.\n\n===Ohio in national politics===\nAs a closely contested state, Ohio was the top choice of Republicans, and often also as Democrats, for place on the national ticket as candidate for president or vice president.\n\nBetween [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]], every Republican president who did not gain the office by the death of his predecessor was born in Ohio; Ulysses Grant, although born in Ohio, was legally a residence of Illinois when he was elected.<ref name = \"prez birthplaces\">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentsusa.net/birth.html|title=U.S. Presidents Birth and Death Information|access-date=May 30, 2015|publisher=CB Presidential Research Service}}</ref>\n\nBy electing so many of her sons to the presidency, Ohio gained a role in politics disproportionate to its size. Several reasons came together. Ohio was a microcosm of the United States, balanced closely between the parties, and at the crossroads of America: between the South, the Northeast, and the developing West, and influenced by each. Its ethnic, religious, and cultural elements were a microcosm of the North. Its cutthroat politics trained candidates in how to win. A leading Ohio politician was \"Available\"\u2014that is, well-suited and electable. Thus, in most presidential years, the governor of Ohio was deemed more available than the governor of the larger states of New York or Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Sinclair|1965|pp=28\u201330}}\n\nThis legend built on itself as the state sent seven men to the White House and four more became vice president. Many others won major patronage plums. Between 1868 and 1924, not only did Ohio supply the most presidents, it supplied the most Cabinet members, and the most federal officeholders. Ohio-born [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] (1876), [[James A. Garfield]] (1880) and [[Benjamin Harrison]] (1888) were each nominated from a convention that had deadlocked, and where the delegates chose to turn to a candidate who could carry Ohio. In each case they did, and won the presidency. According to historian Andrew Sinclair, \"the potency of the Ohio myth gave its [[favorite son]]s a huge advantage in a deadlocked convention\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Sinclair|title=The Available Man: The Life behind the Masks of Warren Gamaliel Harding|url=https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc |url-access=registration |year=1965|pages=[https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc/page/28 28\u201330]|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Progressive era===\n[[File:Fairbanks 4408868314 de2f1cd85b o.jpg|thumb|left|175px|U.S. Second Lady [[Cornelia Cole Fairbanks]] was a powerful progressive operative around the start of the 20th century who helped pave the way for the modern American female politician.]]\nThe [[Progressive Era]] brought about change in the state, although the state had been at the forefront of the movement decades before. In 1852, Ohio passed its first child labor laws, and in 1885 adopted prosecution powers for violations.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KjMhAQAAIAAJ Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 25], p. 472</ref> In 1886, the [[American Federation of Labor]] was formed in Columbus, culminating in the passage of workers' compensation laws by the early 20th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SbKevgHjDsAC The Ohio State Constitution: a reference guide], p. 152</ref>\n\n====Women's rights====\n[[Victoria Woodhull]], the first female candidate for U.S. president in 1872, and U.S. Second Lady [[Cornelia Cole Fairbanks]], credited with paving the way for the modern American female politician, were leaders in the women's suffrage movement.  Ohio was the second state to hold a women's rights convention, the [[Ohio Women's Convention at Salem in 1850]].<ref>Wellman, Judith (2008).

National Park Service, Women's Rights National Historical Park. Wellman is identified as the author of this document here [https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/research.htm]. The first two women's rights conventions were the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] and the [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Convention]], both held in 1848 in western New York.\n</ref> The public voted on women's suffrage in 1912, which failed, but the state ultimately adopted the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment]] in 1920. Ohio-native and U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]] signed the [[White-Slave Traffic Act]] in 1910, which sought to end human trafficking and the sex slave trade.\n\nThe [[Anti-Saloon League]] was founded in 1893 in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], which saw political success with the passage of the [[Volstead Act]] in 1918.\n\n===Constitutional Convention of 1912===\nIn 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with [[Charles Burleigh Galbreath]] as Secretary. The result reflected the concerns of the [[Progressive Era]]. The constitution introduced the [[initiative]] and the [[referendum]], and provided for the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear every 20 years on Ohio's general election ballots. The question asks whether a new constitutional convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, the people have not found the need for a convention. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition and the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.\n\n===Ku Klux Klan===\nIn the early 1920s the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted thousands of Protestant men into membership, warning of the need to purify America, especially against the influence of Catholics, bootleggers, and corrupt politicians.
