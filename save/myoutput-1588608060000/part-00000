He was primarily the Archbishop of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and was second in command only to the [[Patriarch]], [[Shimun XXI Eshai]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shamizdin Flowers.jpg|250px|left|thumb| [[Crown imperial (flower)|Crown Imperial]] - native flower of Hakkari]]\n{{main|Nochiya Tribal Region|List of Nochiyaye settlements}}\n\nThe Nochiya Tribes territory is unique in that it goes through three different countries: [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and [[Iraq]]. The reason for this is because the Nochiya Tribes presence in the region predates these international borders, and because they were not consulted or considered when these international borders were drawn through their lands, similar to how the United States often drew state borders through Native American tribal territory. The Turkey-Iran border was created in 1515 after the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] split the [[Targawar]], [[Bagzadeh]] and [[Margawar]] Clans away from the central [[\u015eemdinli]] district in Turkey, with the Nochiyaye lands within the [[Zagros mountain]] range in the eastern part of their territory becoming part of Iran literally overnight. The Turkey-Iraq border was created in 1926, with the signing of the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], and cut away the Bradost, Rawanduz, and Sherwan Clans from the Shamizdin district in Turkey. However, at this point, no Nochiyaye even live within the heart of their territory in Shamizdin anymore.\n\n===Districts===\nThe [[Nochiya Region]] is an area which consists of [[province]]s, [[district]]s and [[sub-district]]s. The Nochiya Region lies in three different countries: western Iran, northeastern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, with Its ''de jure'' capital based in Mar Ishu,(modern day [[Karakilise, \u015eemdinli]]) as that is where its Metropolitan bishop resided and his cathedral was located historically. The districts that make up parts of the Nochiya Region are [[\u015eemdinli]] in Turkey, [[Soran District]] in Iraq, and the [[Silvaneh District]] in Iran.\n\nRustaqa was the central sub-district of the [[Nochiya Region]]. To the north of [[Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde, Hakkari|Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde]], in the district of [[\u015eemdinli]], [[Turkey]], were the clan-districts of [[Khumara]] and Dairaneh; to the east, in the district of [[Urmia]], [[Persia]], were the sub-districts of [[Bagzadeh]], [[Margawar]] and [[Targawar]]. To the south, in what is now [[Arbil Governorate|Arbil]], [[Iraq]], were the sub-districts of Gargan, Bradost, Sherwan and [[Rawandiz]].\n\nTo this day, the Nochiyayeh people still speak, read, and write Leshana Ateeka (Aramaic). Although Nochiyayeh have lost their land in Semdinli, they remain in the [[Margawar]] subdistrict of Iran in the same villages as before, such as [[Mavana]], and in new villages established in [[Arbil Province]] of Iraqi Kurdistan like [[Shaqlawa]] and are still a very important group within the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Eastern-Assyrian Rite]] church community.\n\n==Religion==\nThere were at least six monasteries and more than 40 churches within the [[Nochiya Region]]. The [[Nochiyaye]] were best known for their adherence to the Nestorian faith; because of this, religious customs such as Lent and prayer were strictly observed. The Mar Ishu Monastery in the village of [[Mar Ishu]] was a theological school for priests and was run by the Metropolitans of [[Shamizdin]], who would not tolerate any changes to the church's canon laws.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n[[File:Mar Yosip Khnanisho.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] at his home in [[Baghdad]], Iraq]]\n\nAn Englishman visiting the [[Nochiya Region]] in the late 19th century noted that \"there is perhaps no Assyrian district where simple piety and loyal devotion to the church of their fathers is more beautifully seen than [[Nochiya Region|Nochiya]]\". Nochiyaye were and are still today most famous for their Nestorian faith and for being the guardians of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]'s canon laws, which they have faithfully preserved.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThere were other important religious figures in the tribe, including two bishops, four archdeacons, twelve priests, and a large number of deacons distributed among the clans. To this day, the majority of the priests and deacons within the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]] belong to the Nochiya tribe, including the Patriarch [[Mar Dinkha IV]].<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\n===Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho XI===\nMar Iskhaq Khnanisho was the spiritual leader of the [[Nochiyaye|Shamizdin Assyrians]] and Metropolitan of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Previously, he was styled as the Metropolitan of [[Rustaqa]]. His diocese in 1914 grew to include [[Shamizdin]], [[Targawar]], and [[Margawar]]. In his diocese were the bishops Mar Dinkha in the village of Tis, an ancestor of the present patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Mar Dinkha IV]]; bishop Mar Youkhana of the village of Tulaki in [[Targawar]], and after 1914, his own nephew, [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]], who was ordained a bishop on the eve of [[World War I]] in [[Qochanis]] by Patriarch [[Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX]].\n\n===Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho XII===\n{{Main|Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X}}\n\nThe 12th and the last of the metropolitans the [[Matran family]] donated to the church was [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]], who died on July 3, 1977 in Baghdad, Iraq. At an early age, he was aware for the sublime position he was dedicated, thus he had learned by heart the complete Eucharistic rites, performed in the church by a deacon or priest. He was tutored adequately by a learned scholar, Rev. Rehana, his father's uncle, who was well versed in the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages and an authority in Eastern theology. Rev. Rehana was the head of the Seminary in Mar Ishu Monastery and he taught classes to a number of students studying for the priesthood. From this seminary many graduated to become bishops and priests in various dioceses and parishes.\n\n[[Image:Ms2080.jpg|left|225px|thumb|New Testament Bible in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]]]\n\nAt age twelve, [[Mar Yosip]] was ordained a deacon. By 1912 [[Mar Yosip]] had already acquired a thorough knowledge of theology therefore he was found to be well suited to be ordained a priest. In the year 1914, at the beginning of World War I, he was sent as a delegate, representing the Metropolitan Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho, to participate in a most important meeting called by [[Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX]], the Catholicos Patriarch at the patriarchal cell in [[Qudchanis]], Turkey, to discuss the effects of the World War on the Church and the nation and prepare for the changes that were expected to take place. While there he was consecrated a bishop on August 10, 1914, by the patriarch and was appointed as assistant to the patriarch.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Cite web |url=http://www.betnahrain.net/Biographies/yosipe.htm |title=Mar Yosip |access-date=2006-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210127/http://www.betnahrain.net/Biographies/yosipe.htm |archive-date=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHe remained in [[Qudchanis]] until 1916 when the Assyrians had to leave their homeland and possessions in consequence of the Great War. After the treacherous assassination of the Patriarch [[Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX]] in 1918, Mar Yosip assumed to a great extent, the leadership of the nation, until the Assyrians arrived in the refugee camps, set up by the [[Red Cross]] and [[League of Nations]], at [[Baqubah]], Iraq in 1918. In December 1918 he was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan in Baghdad by Patriarch Mar Paulos Shimon XX.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nWhen [[Shimun XXI Eshai]], the Catholicos Patriarch, was exiled in 1933 by the monarchial regime of Iraq, [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] was entrusted with the church administration in Iraq and the [[Middle East]].\n\nIn 1973, when [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] resigned his position as the Catholicos Patriarch, [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] was vested with responsibilities of administering the Church of the East throughout the world. At the same time, the Iraqi government issued a Republican decree appointing Mar Yosip Khnanisho as the supreme head of all the Assyrians in Iraq.\n\nOn July 3, 1977, at 1:10 PM [[Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]] died in Baghdad, Iraq. His death coincides with the feast celebrated every year in memory of Mar Tooma Shlikha ([[Saint Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas the Apostle]]).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War I]] the [[Assyrian Genocide]] took place within the [[Ottoman Empire]], which decimated the Nochiyaye, along with all the other [[Assyrian Tribes]] of the [[Hakkari]] mountains. In 1915 The Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains, under the rule of Patriarch [[Shimun XIX Benyamin]], joined the Allied side of the war due to being promised independence and aid by the [[United Kingdom|British]], because the Turks were at the time massacring other ethnic Assyrians(particularly Chaldean and Syriac Catholics) in [[Bitlis]] and [[Diyarbakir]], and because the Turks executed his brother who was studying in [[Istanbul]] in April of that year. Therefore, The Patriarch declared war against the Ottoman Empire and rallied his people alongside the British, [[Russian Empire|Russians]], and [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenians]], in what was known as the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. The Assyrians of the Hakkari Mountains fought hard against the Turks for three years, but were eventually forced to flee the region, as their allies abandoned them, with the Russians leaving due to the [[Russian Revolution]], and the Armenians being too overwhelmed to give aid, while The British ''decided'' not to give them any aid, and in doing so betrayed them. Therefore, The Assyrians had to leave because they were surrounded by hostile Muslim [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] and had no means to continuously fight against them as they were too severely outmanned and outgunned without Allied support. So in 1918, all the Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains fled to Iran to catch British train lines which would take them to Iraq, and they never returned again.\n\n===Urmia, Iran (1915\u20131918)===\nMost [[Nochiyaye]] had already fled Turkey during 1915 into the [[Urmia]] region of [[Iran]], but in 1918 the [[Persian Campaign|Turks invaded Persia]] and the Urmia region was raided, so they fled along with other Assyrians who fled the Hakkari mountains in that same year due to the collapse of Allied support. Led by the metropolitan Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho IX, the tribe left Iran in 1918 on a long journey west into Iran to catch British trains that would take them to [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]].\n\n===Baqubah (1918\u20131920)===\nIn a matter of just a few years, the population of the Nochiya Tribe was drastically reduced from around 12,000 to 4,000. In [[Baqubah]], the 4,000 [[Nochiya Assyrians]] fresh off the trains stayed in the camps for two years under the care of the British Army. As the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] were segregated into large tents according to tribe, the Nochiya Assyrians had a separate dwelling area.\n\n===Sumail (1920\u20131928)===\nIn 1920, they relocated again- this time to [[Sumail]] and the villages around it (such as Graipan) for a period of eight years until 1928, before they eventually settled in the Arbil province, whereupon they were distributed amongst various villages. After the [[Simele Massacre]], the majority of the [[Targawar]] and [[Margawar]] [[Nochiya Assyrians]] headed for [[Habbaniyah]], while some others sought refuge in [[Baghdad]] and [[Kirkuk]]. Some other tribal members fled to [[Syria]], where they established the village of [[Tell Fuweidat Jazira]].\n\n===Arbil Province (1928\u20131963)===\nMost Nochiya fled to other regions of Iraq, but the [[Matran family]] and other tribal members settled in twelve villages in the [[Arbil]] province named [[Harir]], Batas, Qalatdeh, Hinareh, [[Darbandokeh]], Almandana, Qoba, Alaneh, Sarishmeh, Hawdiyan, [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], and [[Bidial]]. Graipan and Hazarjut were two villages in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] that were also partly inhabited by Nochiyaye.\n\nThere were three main reasons why they chose the governorate of Arbil. Firstly, it was geographically closer to the original [[Nochiya Region]] than other areas like [[Duhok, Iraq|Dohuk]]. Secondly, there was some friction with other tribes, namely the Lower Tyari tribe, which chose the Dohuk province since it too was closer to their former Turkish district. Thirdly, it was at the suggestion of Ishmael Beg of [[Rawandiz]] and Said Taha of Nehri, who, by then, had been appointed governor of the [[Rawandiz District]]. They had settled in Batas and invited [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] to be their new neighbor again since they shared clan territories pre-1915. A fourth reason may have been because there were also other, more friendly Assyrian tribes in the region such as the Rawandiz, Bradost and Sherwan.\n\nThe Nochiyaye stayed in these villages for 35 years until July 1963, when they were defeated while fighting alongside the Kurds in the [[First Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War]] for an independent [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]]. After this upheaval, the Nochiyaye left their villages and fled to major cities such as Arbil, Kirkuk and Baghdad. The residents of Hawdiyan and Bidial, however, were not uprooted by the war; they remained in their respective villages.\n\n===Modern Nochiyaye (1963 - present)===\nDuring the early 1960s, many [[Nochiya Assyrians]] resided in the city of [[Baghdad]] in the Assyrian suburb of [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]]. A few hundred Nochiyaye still live in Iran in [[Silvaneh District]] as well. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of the Nochiyaye immigrated to [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australia]] (Particularly [[Sydney]]). Some 3,500 Nochiyaye remain in [[Iraq]], with approximately half of them living in Baghdad and the other half in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]], primarily Arbil Governorate in [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], [[Darbandokeh]], Hawdiyan, [[Harir]], [[Bidial]] and [[Shaqlawa]]. However, after the fall of Iraq in 2003 and the chaos which ensued, many Nochiyaye living in Baghdad have moved to the villages in Arbil Governorate. Therefore, Renewed efforts were made to re-establish some of those villages which over time were abandoned, and now villages like Harir, Cairu, and Zariwan have been repopulated. Unlike other Assyrian villages in Iraq, Nochiyaye live in close proximity with Kurds, and in many cases live in the same villages.\n\n==Notable Nochiyaye==\n'''Nochiyaye''' ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Syriac]]: <big><big>\u0722\u0718\u073f\u071f\u071d\u073c\u071d\u0710</big></big> ''Nochiyaye''), also known as '''Nochiya Assyrians''', is the term given to the [[Assyrian people]] of the Nochiya Tribe.\n\n===Religious Figures===\n*Assyrian Church of the East:\n**[[Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]] - [[Mar Ishu]], NOCHIYA - Last Metropolitan of Shamizdin, d.1977, Baghdad\n**[[Mar Dinkha IV]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Patriarch\n**[[Mar Emmanuel Yosip]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Bishop, Diocese of Canada\n\n===Political Activists===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Previous Secretary General, Assyrian Universal Alliance, Chicago\n*Kurdistan Democratic Party:\n**[[Fawzi Hariri]] - [[Harir]], Iraq - \u2018Iraqi Minister for Industry' & 'Elected INC Member'\n**[[Sargis Aghajan]] - [[Diyana]], Iraq\n\n===Others===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Professor at [[Western Michigan University]]\n*[http://www.geniro.net Geniro] - Tees, - Darbandokeh, Pop Singer, Canada brother of Ninos Dikho\n\n==See also==\n* [[Assyrian people]]\n* [[Assyrian Tribes]]\n* [[List of Assyrians]]\n* [[List of Assyrian settlements]]\n* [[Jilu]], a tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Tyari]], another tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Y\u00fcksekova|Gawar]], an Assyrian tribe in Hakkari\n* [[Anda\u00e7, Uludere|Halmon]], an Assyrian tribe in [[Sirnak province]], bordering Hakkari\n* [[\u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca|Ashita]], an Assyrian tribe in Tyari\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Nochiya Tribe| ]]\n\n[[es:Nochiya]]\n[[ku:N\u00eaw\u00e7iya]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses2|Nochiya}}\n{{more sources|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Group of Targawar Assyrian Warriors.jpg|300px|thumb|A group of [[Mavana|Mawana]] <big>(\u072b\u0735\u0726\u0732\u071b\u0722\u0735\u071d\u0739\u0710</big>) Nochiyaye men belonging to the [[Targawar]] sub-district, [[Iran]].

He was primarily the Archbishop of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and was second in command only to the [[Patriarch]], [[Shimun XXI Eshai]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shamizdin Flowers.jpg|250px|left|thumb| [[Crown imperial (flower)|Crown Imperial]] - native flower of Hakkari]]\n{{main|Nochiya Tribal Region|List of Nochiyaye settlements}}\n\nThe Nochiya Tribes territory is unique in that it goes through three different countries: [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and [[Iraq]]. The reason for this is because the Nochiya Tribes presence in the region predates these international borders, and because they were not consulted or considered when these international borders were drawn through their lands, similar to how the United States often drew state borders through Native American tribal territory. The Turkey-Iran border was created in 1515 after the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] split the [[Targawar]], [[Bagzadeh]] and [[Margawar]] Clans away from the central [[\u015eemdinli]] district in Turkey, with the Nochiyaye lands within the [[Zagros mountain]] range in the eastern part of their territory becoming part of Iran literally overnight. The Turkey-Iraq border was created in 1926, with the signing of the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], and cut away the Bradost, Rawanduz, and Sherwan Clans from the Shamizdin district in Turkey. However, at this point, no Nochiyaye even live within the heart of their territory in Shamizdin anymore.\n\n===Districts===\nThe [[Nochiya Region]] is an area which consists of [[province]]s, [[district]]s and [[sub-district]]s. The Nochiya Region lies in three different countries: western Iran, northeastern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, with Its ''de jure'' capital based in Mar Ishu,(modern day [[Karakilise, \u015eemdinli]]) as that is where its Metropolitan bishop resided and his cathedral was located historically. The districts that make up parts of the Nochiya Region are [[\u015eemdinli]] in Turkey, [[Soran District]] in Iraq, and the [[Silvaneh District]] in Iran.\n\nRustaqa was the central sub-district of the [[Nochiya Region]]. To the north of [[Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde, Hakkari|Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde]], in the district of [[\u015eemdinli]], [[Turkey]], were the clan-districts of [[Khumara]] and Dairaneh; to the east, in the district of [[Urmia]], [[Persia]], were the sub-districts of [[Bagzadeh]], [[Margawar]] and [[Targawar]]. To the south, in what is now [[Arbil Governorate|Arbil]], [[Iraq]], were the sub-districts of Gargan, Bradost, Sherwan and [[Rawandiz]].\n\nTo this day, the Nochiyayeh people still speak, read, and write Leshana Ateeka (Aramaic). Although Nochiyayeh have lost their land in Semdinli, they remain in the [[Margawar]] subdistrict of Iran in the same villages as before, such as [[Mavana]], and in new villages established in [[Arbil Province]] of Iraqi Kurdistan like [[Shaqlawa]] and are still a very important group within the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Eastern-Assyrian Rite]] church community.\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Christianity in Nochiya}}\nThere were at least six monasteries and more than 40 churches within the [[Nochiya Region]]. The [[Nochiyaye]] were best known for their adherence to the Nestorian faith; because of this, religious customs such as Lent and prayer were strictly observed. The Mar Ishu Monastery in the village of [[Mar Ishu]] was a theological school for priests and was run by the Metropolitans of [[Shamizdin]], who would not tolerate any changes to the church's canon laws.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n[[File:Mar Yosip Khnanisho.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] at his home in [[Baghdad]], Iraq]]\n\nAn Englishman visiting the [[Nochiya Region]] in the late 19th century noted that \"there is perhaps no Assyrian district where simple piety and loyal devotion to the church of their fathers is more beautifully seen than [[Nochiya Region|Nochiya]]\". Nochiyaye were and are still today most famous for their Nestorian faith and for being the guardians of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]'s canon laws, which they have faithfully preserved.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThere were other important religious figures in the tribe, including two bishops, four archdeacons, twelve priests, and a large number of deacons distributed among the clans. To this day, the majority of the priests and deacons within the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]] belong to the Nochiya tribe, including the Patriarch [[Mar Dinkha IV]].<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\n===Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho XI===\nMar Iskhaq Khnanisho was the spiritual leader of the [[Nochiyaye|Shamizdin Assyrians]] and Metropolitan of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Previously, he was styled as the Metropolitan of [[Rustaqa]]. His diocese in 1914 grew to include [[Shamizdin]], [[Targawar]], and [[Margawar]]. In his diocese were the bishops Mar Dinkha in the village of Tis, an ancestor of the present patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Mar Dinkha IV]]; bishop Mar Youkhana of the village of Tulaki in [[Targawar]], and after 1914, his own nephew, [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]], who was ordained a bishop on the eve of [[World War I]] in [[Qochanis]] by Patriarch [[Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX]].\n\n===Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho XII===\n{{Main|Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X}}\n\nThe 12th and the last of the metropolitans the [[Matran family]] donated to the church was [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]], who died on July 3, 1977 in Baghdad, Iraq. At an early age, he was aware for the sublime position he was dedicated, thus he had learned by heart the complete Eucharistic rites, performed in the church by a deacon or priest. He was tutored adequately by a learned scholar, Rev. Rehana, his father's uncle, who was well versed in the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages and an authority in Eastern theology. Rev. Rehana was the head of the Seminary in Mar Ishu Monastery and he taught classes to a number of students studying for the priesthood. From this seminary many graduated to become bishops and priests in various dioceses and parishes.\n\n[[Image:Ms2080.jpg|left|225px|thumb|New Testament Bible in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]]]\n\nAt age twelve, [[Mar Yosip]] was ordained a deacon. By 1912 [[Mar Yosip]] had already acquired a thorough knowledge of theology therefore he was found to be well suited to be ordained a priest. In the year 1914, at the beginning of World War I, he was sent as a delegate, representing the Metropolitan Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho, to participate in a most important meeting called by [[Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX]], the Catholicos Patriarch at the patriarchal cell in [[Qudchanis]], Turkey, to discuss the effects of the World War on the Church and the nation and prepare for the changes that were expected to take place. While there he was consecrated a bishop on August 10, 1914, by the patriarch and was appointed as assistant to the patriarch.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Cite web |url=http://www.betnahrain.net/Biographies/yosipe.htm |title=Mar Yosip |access-date=2006-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210127/http://www.betnahrain.net/Biographies/yosipe.htm |archive-date=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHe remained in [[Qudchanis]] until 1916 when the Assyrians had to leave their homeland and possessions in consequence of the Great War. After the treacherous assassination of the Patriarch [[Mar Benyamin Shimon XIX]] in 1918, Mar Yosip assumed to a great extent, the leadership of the nation, until the Assyrians arrived in the refugee camps, set up by the [[Red Cross]] and [[League of Nations]], at [[Baqubah]], Iraq in 1918. In December 1918 he was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan in Baghdad by Patriarch Mar Paulos Shimon XX.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nWhen [[Shimun XXI Eshai]], the Catholicos Patriarch, was exiled in 1933 by the monarchial regime of Iraq, [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] was entrusted with the church administration in Iraq and the [[Middle East]].\n\nIn 1973, when [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] resigned his position as the Catholicos Patriarch, [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] was vested with responsibilities of administering the Church of the East throughout the world. At the same time, the Iraqi government issued a Republican decree appointing Mar Yosip Khnanisho as the supreme head of all the Assyrians in Iraq.\n\nOn July 3, 1977, at 1:10 PM [[Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]] died in Baghdad, Iraq. His death coincides with the feast celebrated every year in memory of Mar Tooma Shlikha ([[Saint Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas the Apostle]]).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War I]] the [[Assyrian Genocide]] took place within the [[Ottoman Empire]], which decimated the Nochiyaye, along with all the other [[Assyrian Tribes]] of the [[Hakkari]] mountains. In 1915 The Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains, under the rule of Patriarch [[Shimun XIX Benyamin]], joined the Allied side of the war due to being promised independence and aid by the [[United Kingdom|British]], because the Turks were at the time massacring other ethnic Assyrians(particularly Chaldean and Syriac Catholics) in [[Bitlis]] and [[Diyarbakir]], and because the Turks executed his brother who was studying in [[Istanbul]] in April of that year. Therefore, The Patriarch declared war against the Ottoman Empire and rallied his people alongside the British, [[Russian Empire|Russians]], and [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenians]], in what was known as the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. The Assyrians of the Hakkari Mountains fought hard against the Turks for three years, but were eventually forced to flee the region, as their allies abandoned them, with the Russians leaving due to the [[Russian Revolution]], and the Armenians being too overwhelmed to give aid, while The British ''decided'' not to give them any aid, and in doing so betrayed them. Therefore, The Assyrians had to leave because they were surrounded by hostile Muslim [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] and had no means to continuously fight against them as they were too severely outmanned and outgunned without Allied support. So in 1918, all the Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains fled to Iran to catch British train lines which would take them to Iraq, and they never returned again.\n\n===Urmia, Iran (1915\u20131918)===\nMost [[Nochiyaye]] had already fled Turkey during 1915 into the [[Urmia]] region of [[Iran]], but in 1918 the [[Persian Campaign|Turks invaded Persia]] and the Urmia region was raided, so they fled along with other Assyrians who fled the Hakkari mountains in that same year due to the collapse of Allied support. Led by the metropolitan Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho IX, the tribe left Iran in 1918 on a long journey west into Iran to catch British trains that would take them to [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]].\n\n===Baqubah (1918\u20131920)===\nIn a matter of just a few years, the population of the Nochiya Tribe was drastically reduced from around 12,000 to 4,000. In [[Baqubah]], the 4,000 [[Nochiya Assyrians]] fresh off the trains stayed in the camps for two years under the care of the British Army. As the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] were segregated into large tents according to tribe, the Nochiya Assyrians had a separate dwelling area.\n\n===Sumail (1920\u20131928)===\nIn 1920, they relocated again- this time to [[Sumail]] and the villages around it (such as Graipan) for a period of eight years until 1928, before they eventually settled in the Arbil province, whereupon they were distributed amongst various villages. After the [[Simele Massacre]], the majority of the [[Targawar]] and [[Margawar]] [[Nochiya Assyrians]] headed for [[Habbaniyah]], while some others sought refuge in [[Baghdad]] and [[Kirkuk]]. Some other tribal members fled to [[Syria]], where they established the village of [[Tell Fuweidat Jazira]].\n\n===Arbil Province (1928\u20131963)===\nMost Nochiya fled to other regions of Iraq, but the [[Matran family]] and other tribal members settled in twelve villages in the [[Arbil]] province named [[Harir]], Batas, Qalatdeh, Hinareh, [[Darbandokeh]], Almandana, Qoba, Alaneh, Sarishmeh, Hawdiyan, [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], and [[Bidial]]. Graipan and Hazarjut were two villages in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] that were also partly inhabited by Nochiyaye.\n\nThere were three main reasons why they chose the governorate of Arbil. Firstly, it was geographically closer to the original [[Nochiya Region]] than other areas like [[Duhok, Iraq|Dohuk]]. Secondly, there was some friction with other tribes, namely the Lower Tyari tribe, which chose the Dohuk province since it too was closer to their former Turkish district. Thirdly, it was at the suggestion of Ishmael Beg of [[Rawandiz]] and Said Taha of Nehri, who, by then, had been appointed governor of the [[Rawandiz District]]. They had settled in Batas and invited [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] to be their new neighbor again since they shared clan territories pre-1915. A fourth reason may have been because there were also other, more friendly Assyrian tribes in the region such as the Rawandiz, Bradost and Sherwan.\n\nThe Nochiyaye stayed in these villages for 35 years until July 1963, when they were defeated while fighting alongside the Kurds in the [[First Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War]] for an independent [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]]. After this upheaval, the Nochiyaye left their villages and fled to major cities such as Arbil, Kirkuk and Baghdad. The residents of Hawdiyan and Bidial, however, were not uprooted by the war; they remained in their respective villages.\n\n===Modern Nochiyaye (1963 - present)===\nDuring the early 1960s, many [[Nochiya Assyrians]] resided in the city of [[Baghdad]] in the Assyrian suburb of [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]]. A few hundred Nochiyaye still live in Iran in [[Silvaneh District]] as well. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of the Nochiyaye immigrated to [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australia]] (Particularly [[Sydney]]). Some 3,500 Nochiyaye remain in [[Iraq]], with approximately half of them living in Baghdad and the other half in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]], primarily Arbil Governorate in [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], [[Darbandokeh]], Hawdiyan, [[Harir]], [[Bidial]] and [[Shaqlawa]]. However, after the fall of Iraq in 2003 and the chaos which ensued, many Nochiyaye living in Baghdad have moved to the villages in Arbil Governorate. Therefore, Renewed efforts were made to re-establish some of those villages which over time were abandoned, and now villages like Harir, Cairu, and Zariwan have been repopulated. Unlike other Assyrian villages in Iraq, Nochiyaye live in close proximity with Kurds, and in many cases live in the same villages.\n\n==Notable Nochiyaye==\n'''Nochiyaye''' ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Syriac]]: <big><big>\u0722\u0718\u073f\u071f\u071d\u073c\u071d\u0710</big></big> ''Nochiyaye''), also known as '''Nochiya Assyrians''', is the term given to the [[Assyrian people]] of the Nochiya Tribe.\n\n===Religious Figures===\n*Assyrian Church of the East:\n**[[Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]] - [[Mar Ishu]], NOCHIYA - Last Metropolitan of Shamizdin, d.1977, Baghdad\n**[[Mar Dinkha IV]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Patriarch\n**[[Mar Emmanuel Yosip]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Bishop, Diocese of Canada\n\n===Political Activists===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Previous Secretary General, Assyrian Universal Alliance, Chicago\n*Kurdistan Democratic Party:\n**[[Fawzi Hariri]] - [[Harir]], Iraq - \u2018Iraqi Minister for Industry' & 'Elected INC Member'\n**[[Sargis Aghajan]] - [[Diyana]], Iraq\n\n===Others===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Professor at [[Western Michigan University]]\n*[http://www.geniro.net Geniro] - Tees, - Darbandokeh, Pop Singer, Canada brother of Ninos Dikho\n\n==See also==\n* [[Assyrian people]]\n* [[Assyrian Tribes]]\n* [[List of Assyrians]]\n* [[List of Assyrian settlements]]\n* [[Jilu]], a tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Tyari]], another tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Y\u00fcksekova|Gawar]], an Assyrian tribe in Hakkari\n* [[Anda\u00e7, Uludere|Halmon]], an Assyrian tribe in [[Sirnak province]], bordering Hakkari\n* [[\u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca|Ashita]], an Assyrian tribe in Tyari\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Nochiya Tribe| ]]\n\n[[es:Nochiya]]\n[[ku:N\u00eaw\u00e7iya]]\n", "name_user": "Sems\u00fbr\u00ee", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReligion:redirects to this page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nochiya_tribe"}
