Its central character is the streetwise magician [[John Constantine]], who was created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Stephen R. Bissette]], and first appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title. ''Hellblazer'' had been published continuously since January [[1988 in comics|1988]], and was Vertigo's longest running title, the only remaining publication from the imprint's launch.<ref name=\"vert-ency\">{{Cite book | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

Well known for its political and [[social commentary]], the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.\n\nThe series was the longest-running and one of the most successful titles of DC's Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone for many British writers.

Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"vert-ency\"/>\n\nConstantine made appearances in other comic book titles, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', ''[[Green Arrow]]'', ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'', and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]''. He was a recurring supporting character in both ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' throughout their numerous incarnations. Some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family-friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate, such as \"Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin\" in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Captain Atom]]'' (who refers to Constantine as \"an impertinent bumbler in England\"). Grant Morrison created \"Willoughby Kipling\" for ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' after being refused Constantine by DC, changing his appearance to that of [[Richard E. Grant]] in ''[[Withnail and I]]'', following which [[Phil Foglio]] was forced to create \"Ambroise Bierce\" in ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]'', having been refused both Constantine ''and'' Willoughby Kipling.<ref name=legends />\n\nJohn Constantine was reintroduced into the DC Universe in 2011, initially in the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' [[crossover event]] title ''Search for the Swamp Thing'', and in the ongoing [[The New 52]] title ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.<ref name=JLD>{{cite news|title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html|work=Newsarama|date=9 June 2011|author=Vaneta Rogers|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921114112/http://www.newsarama.com/7775-milligan-dcnu-justice-league-spin-off-emotionally-dark.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Jamie Delano (#1\u201324, #28\u201340, #84, #250)===\n[[File:Hellblazercover.jpg|thumb|left|Jamie Delano would often put his own political views in the comic.

Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with [[Freemasons]] from the [[Houses of Parliament]]. He also had [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] issues crop up, especially in \"The Fear Machine\" (issues #15\u201322), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor [[Karen Berger]] noted on Delano's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that [[Margaret Thatcher]] was forced out of office.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|page=38|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nThere were five main storylines in the run. The first, collected as \"Original Sins\",<ref>{{cite book|title=Original Sins|publisher=Vertigo|date=October 1998|ISBN=1-56389-052-6}}</ref> deals with John travelling to America to exorcise a demon, [[Mnemoth]], and investigate a strange cult known as Damnation's Army, crossing paths with a demon called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Nergal|Nergal]] (from whom he gains demon blood), and having to be responsible for killing an old friend, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Gary Lester]], and betraying another friend, called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Mary 'Zed' Martin|Zed]], in the process. The following four issues, \"The Devil You Know\"<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\">{{cite book|title=Rare Cuts|publisher=Vertigo|date=May 2007|ISBN= 1-4012-1269-7}}</ref> finally explain John's failure to save a young girl, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Astra]], from a demon in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], an event that left him near insane and incarcerated in an asylum known as Ravenscar, and still haunted him to the comic's end. He eventually discovers that the demon responsible for this was Nergal, and uses a technological scheme to trap him, and lead him back to hell. It also contains a crossover with ''Swamp Thing'', where Constantine loses his body while the Swamp Thing uses it to procreate.\n\nThis was followed by a lengthy nine-issue story arc, \"The Fear Machine\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fear Machine|publisher=Vertigo|date=June 2008|ISBN=1-4012-1810-5}}</ref> revolving around a masonic plot to collect people's fears, in order to raise a dormant god known as Juntakillokian, and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists, including [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Mercury]], a young psychic girl, and [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Marj]], her mother, with whom he becomes romantically involved. The penultimate major run of Delano's tenure was \"[[List of characters in Hellblazer#The Family Man|The Family Man]]\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Family Man|publisher=Titan Books|date=November 2008|ISBN= 1-84576-978-3}}</ref> which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine's nemesis is not supernatural (beyond an opening [[metafiction]]al encounter with a fictional [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]), but a former policeman turned serial killer. John's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable, and his coping with the murder of his father, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Thomas]], frames this story. During this run on the title, [[Grant Morrison]] (issues #25 & 26) and [[Neil Gaiman]] (issue #27) both filled in during a three-month break, Grant Morrison's story dealing with nuclear fear, and Neil Gaiman's being a simple romantic ghost story.\n\nDelano's run ended with \"[[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Golden Child|The Golden Child]]\", where John is reunited with Marj and Mercury, who help him discover that he murdered his more perfect twin in the womb, culminating in an extended story, in which we are shown what would have occurred had the other twin survived in his place.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> During his run, there was also a stand-alone issue, ''Hellblazer Annual'' #1, exploring Constantine's ancestry, and featuring the video to John's punk band, Mucous Membrane's song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV6Sl_u1s3M \"Venus of the Hardsell\"].\n\nJamie Delano returned to the title on several occasions. Between the Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins runs on ''Hellblazer'', he finally told the story of why John's best friend Chas 'owes' him (issue #84), and he returned again for one of the five Christmas stories in issue #250. He also wrote the miniseries ''[[The Horrorist (comics)|The Horrorist]]'' in 1995, and ''[[Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood|Bad Blood]]'' in 2000, both featuring John Constantine. A more substantial return was made in 2010 for a hardcover graphic novel ''[[Hellblazer: Pandemonium]]'' with artist [[Jock (artist)|Jock]] to commemorate the 25th anniversary of John Constantine's first appearance in ''Swamp Thing''.<ref name=cbr10971>{{cite web |first=Emmett |last=Furey |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10971 |title=Back into Hell: Jamie Delano returns to John Constantine's world |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508045734/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10971 |archivedate=May 8, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===1991\u20131999===\n====Garth Ennis (#41\u201383, #129\u2013133)====\n[[File:FirstoftheFallen.jpg|thumb|right|The First of the Fallen, a principal antagonist in Garth Ennis' run on ''Hellblazer'', as drawn by William Simpson]]\n\nIrish writer [[Garth Ennis]] then took over the title in [[1991 in comics|1991]], again from ''2000 AD'', where he had been working on ''[[Judge Dredd]]''. He proceeded to write the second-longest run for any writer on the title.<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> His take on the title was more personal than Jamie Delano's, with John's relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the [[First of the Fallen]], and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a [[succubus]] demon, [[Chantinelle|Ellie]], would go on to be used again as a major plot device in ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'', one of his most popular works. He also references the music of [[The Pogues]] and the poetry of [[Brendan Behan]], both of these being relevant to Ennis' Irish heritage.\n\nHis run started with \"[[Dangerous Habits]]\" (41\u201346),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dangerous Habits|publisher=Vertigo|author=Garth Ennis|isbn=1-56389-150-6}}</ref> which was the basis for the 2005 film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', and dealt with John Constantine contracting [[lung cancer]], and the desperate deal he makes with the First of the Fallen, and various other lords of Hell, to save himself. In the course of trying to save himself, he visits Ireland, and later becomes reacquainted with [[Heartland (comics)|Kit Ryan]], an old friend of Irish origin. The following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with Kit, a plot to install a demon on the British throne in the plotline \"Royal Blood\", and in the extended issue #50, his first meeting with the [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The King of the Vampires|King of the Vampires]]. One minor story in this arc (issue #51) was written by guest writer [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]].<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Bloodlines|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=Vertigo|ISBN=1-40121-514-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/johnconstantineh0000enni_s5x4}}</ref>\n\nThe next major arc, \"Fear and Loathing\" (issues 62-67) covers a high point of John's personal life, with his relationship with Kit going well, and a fortieth birthday party where his friends Ellie, [[Zatanna]], and the Swamp Thing attend, and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of [[Old Bushmills Distillery|Bushmills]] whiskey and [[marijuana]]. The story then takes him to his lowest point, through his dealings with the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], their threats towards Kit, and her leaving him to return to Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fear and Loathing|author=Garth Ennis| ISBN=1-56389-202-2|publisher=Vertigo}}</ref> Following this, John is defeated, and lives homeless on the streets, drinking to forget his life.

He is accompanied by the spirit of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], who has to hold his brain in place from his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|infamous wound]]. He eventually learns how to escape, shortly before running into the First of the Fallen, in the guise of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. There then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in Dublin, offering some closure to his recent problems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Damnation's Flame|author=Garth Ennis|ISBN=1-56389-508-0|publisher=Vertigo}}</ref> Ennis' run ends with \"Rake at the Gates of Hell\", a story which finally brings together the racism storyline, with riots in [[Mile End]], echoing the real-life [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton]] and [[Broadwater Farm riot|Broadwater Farm]] riots in London, the revenge attempt of the First of the Fallen, started in \"Dangerous Habits\", and the end of John's relationship with Kit Ryan.

Mike Carey also has the honour of being the first [[Liverpudlian]] to write the Liverpudlian character. His was the second longest run by any single author on the title up to that time, second only to Garth Ennis,<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> until Peter Milligan's run.\n\nThe start of his run introduces Angie Spatchcock, a fellow magician, and reintroduces his niece, Gemma Constantine, who has also fallen into magic use, to her uncle's consternation. After ridding his sister's house of an evil spirit, and finding out Gemma has gone missing, John returns to London, to find his old colleagues and enemies are all taking sides in the hunt for a mythical item, known as the Red Sepulchre.

John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped.

His run implemented several major changes, including John Constantine's wedding and the loss of his thumb.\n\nIn a rare change, Milligan's run on the title starts with John living in domestic bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over the course of the first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a [[Babylonia]]n demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the [[Liverpool dockers' strike (1995\u201398)|Liverpool dockers' strike]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Scab|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2501-2}},</ref> gone insane and sought help from [[Shade, The Changing Man]], after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian,<ref>{{cite book|title=Hooked|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2728-7}},</ref> and traveled to India to try to find a way of saving her.<ref>{{cite book|title=India|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2848-8}},</ref> Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.\n\nAfterwards, John's coat (which Gemma sold on [[eBay]]) began to manipulate its various new owners into murder, suicide, or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the U.S., who tried to kill John and Epiphany. During the time the coat was missing, John's magical abilities had begun to go out of control. John eventually resolves this, and he was re-united with his coat. Since this, Gemma and John have a very shaky relationship with one another, and she began a sexual relationship with Epiphany's crime-boss father Terry in order to \"punish\" John. When he confronted her about this relationship though, she told him that she would not stop unless he was able to retrieve her mother's soul from Hell. John agreed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer 276\u2013285|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan}}</ref> In order to get his sister to leave Hell, John agreed to track down her son, his adopted nephew, in Ireland.\n\nOn October 8, 2012, the series was announced as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]'' started at the main imprint of DC comics.<ref name=Cancelled/> By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the [[Three Fates]], who tell him that he will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.\n\nSo John left Epiphany in Ireland and returned to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called \"A Long Journey's End\" surrounded by people, in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Death and Cigarettes|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1401240933}}</ref>\n\n=== Relaunch (2019) ===\n{{out of date|section}}\nIn July 2019, DC announced that ''Hellblazer'' would be relaunched as part of ''[[The Sandman Universe]]'' line of comics.

Its central character is the streetwise magician [[John Constantine]], who was created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Stephen R. Bissette]], and first appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title.

Well known for its political and [[social commentary]], the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.\n\nThe series was the longest-running and one of the most successful titles of DC's Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone for many British writers.

Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"vert-ency\"/>\n\nConstantine made appearances in other comic book titles, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', ''[[Green Arrow]]'', ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'', and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]''. He was a recurring supporting character in both ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' throughout their numerous incarnations. Some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family-friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate, such as \"Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin\" in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Captain Atom]]'' (who refers to Constantine as \"an impertinent bumbler in England\"). Grant Morrison created \"Willoughby Kipling\" for ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' after being refused Constantine by DC, changing his appearance to that of [[Richard E. Grant]] in ''[[Withnail and I]]'', following which [[Phil Foglio]] was forced to create \"Ambroise Bierce\" in ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]'', having been refused both Constantine ''and'' Willoughby Kipling.<ref name=legends />\n\nJohn Constantine was reintroduced into the DC Universe in 2011, initially in the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' [[crossover event]] title ''Search for the Swamp Thing'', and in the ongoing [[The New 52]] title ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.<ref name=JLD>{{cite news|title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html|work=Newsarama|date=9 June 2011|author=Vaneta Rogers|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921114112/http://www.newsarama.com/7775-milligan-dcnu-justice-league-spin-off-emotionally-dark.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Jamie Delano (#1\u201324, #28\u201340, #84, #250)===\n[[File:Hellblazercover.jpg|thumb|left|Jamie Delano would often put his own political views in the comic.

Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with [[Freemasons]] from the [[Houses of Parliament]]. He also had [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] issues crop up, especially in \"The Fear Machine\" (issues #15\u201322), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor [[Karen Berger]] noted on Delano's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that [[Margaret Thatcher]] was forced out of office.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|page=38|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nThere were five main storylines in the run. The first, collected as \"Original Sins\",<ref>{{cite book|title=Original Sins|publisher=Vertigo|date=October 1998|ISBN=1-56389-052-6}}</ref> deals with John travelling to America to exorcise a demon, [[Mnemoth]], and investigate a strange cult known as Damnation's Army, crossing paths with a demon called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Nergal|Nergal]] (from whom he gains demon blood), and having to be responsible for killing an old friend, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Gary Lester]], and betraying another friend, called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Mary 'Zed' Martin|Zed]], in the process. The following four issues, \"The Devil You Know\"<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\">{{cite book|title=Rare Cuts|publisher=Vertigo|date=May 2007|ISBN= 1-4012-1269-7}}</ref> finally explain John's failure to save a young girl, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Astra]], from a demon in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], an event that left him near insane and incarcerated in an asylum known as Ravenscar, and still haunted him to the comic's end. He eventually discovers that the demon responsible for this was Nergal, and uses a technological scheme to trap him, and lead him back to hell. It also contains a crossover with ''Swamp Thing'', where Constantine loses his body while the Swamp Thing uses it to procreate.\n\nThis was followed by a lengthy nine-issue story arc, \"The Fear Machine\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fear Machine|publisher=Vertigo|date=June 2008|ISBN=1-4012-1810-5}}</ref> revolving around a masonic plot to collect people's fears, in order to raise a dormant god known as Juntakillokian, and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists, including [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Mercury]], a young psychic girl, and [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Marj]], her mother, with whom he becomes romantically involved. The penultimate major run of Delano's tenure was \"[[List of characters in Hellblazer#The Family Man|The Family Man]]\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Family Man|publisher=Titan Books|date=November 2008|ISBN= 1-84576-978-3}}</ref> which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine's nemesis is not supernatural (beyond an opening [[metafiction]]al encounter with a fictional [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]), but a former policeman turned serial killer. John's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable, and his coping with the murder of his father, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Thomas]], frames this story. During this run on the title, [[Grant Morrison]] (issues #25 & 26) and [[Neil Gaiman]] (issue #27) both filled in during a three-month break, Grant Morrison's story dealing with nuclear fear, and Neil Gaiman's being a simple romantic ghost story.\n\nDelano's run ended with \"[[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Golden Child|The Golden Child]]\", where John is reunited with Marj and Mercury, who help him discover that he murdered his more perfect twin in the womb, culminating in an extended story, in which we are shown what would have occurred had the other twin survived in his place.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> During his run, there was also a stand-alone issue, ''Hellblazer Annual'' #1, exploring Constantine's ancestry, and featuring the video to John's punk band, Mucous Membrane's song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV6Sl_u1s3M \"Venus of the Hardsell\"].\n\nJamie Delano returned to the title on several occasions. Between the Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins runs on ''Hellblazer'', he finally told the story of why John's best friend Chas 'owes' him (issue #84), and he returned again for one of the five Christmas stories in issue #250. He also wrote the miniseries ''[[The Horrorist (comics)|The Horrorist]]'' in 1995, and ''[[Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood|Bad Blood]]'' in 2000, both featuring John Constantine.

He proceeded to write the longest run for any writer on the title.<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> His take on the title was more personal than Jamie Delano's, with John's relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the [[First of the Fallen]], and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a [[succubus]] demon, [[Chantinelle|Ellie]], would go on to be used again as a major plot device in ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'', one of his most popular works. He also references the music of [[The Pogues]] and the poetry of [[Brendan Behan]], both of these being relevant to Ennis' Irish heritage.\n\nHis run started with \"[[Dangerous Habits]]\" (41\u201346),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dangerous Habits|publisher=Vertigo|author=Garth Ennis|isbn=1-56389-150-6}}</ref> which was the basis for the 2005 film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', and dealt with John Constantine contracting [[lung cancer]], and the desperate deal he makes with the First of the Fallen, and various other lords of Hell, to save himself. In the course of trying to save himself, he visits Ireland, and later becomes reacquainted with [[Heartland (comics)|Kit Ryan]], an old friend of Irish origin. The following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with Kit, a plot to install a demon on the British throne in the plotline \"Royal Blood\", and in the extended issue #50, his first meeting with the [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The King of the Vampires|King of the Vampires]]. One minor story in this arc (issue #51) was written by guest writer [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]].<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Bloodlines|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=Vertigo|ISBN=1-40121-514-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/johnconstantineh0000enni_s5x4}}</ref>\n\nThe next major arc, \"Fear and Loathing\" (issues 62-67) covers a high point of John's personal life, with his relationship with Kit going well, and a fortieth birthday party where his friends Ellie, [[Zatanna]], and the Swamp Thing attend, and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of [[Old Bushmills Distillery|Bushmills]] whiskey and [[marijuana]]. The story then takes him to his lowest point, through his dealings with the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], their threats towards Kit, and her leaving him to return to Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fear and Loathing|author=Garth Ennis| ISBN=1-56389-202-2|publisher=Vertigo}}</ref> Following this, John is defeated, and lives homeless on the streets, drinking to forget his life.

He is accompanied by the spirit of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], who has to hold his brain in place from his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|infamous wound]]. He eventually learns how to escape, shortly before running into the First of the Fallen, in the guise of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. There then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in Dublin, offering some closure to his recent problems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Damnation's Flame|author=Garth Ennis|ISBN=1-56389-508-0|publisher=Vertigo}}</ref> Ennis' run ends with \"Rake at the Gates of Hell\", a story which finally brings together the racism storyline, with riots in [[Mile End]], echoing the real-life [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton]] and [[Broadwater Farm riot|Broadwater Farm]] riots in London, the revenge attempt of the First of the Fallen, started in \"Dangerous Habits\", and the end of John's relationship with Kit Ryan.

Mike Carey also has the honour of being the first [[Liverpudlian]] to write the Liverpudlian character. His was the second longest run by any single author on the title up to that time, second only to Garth Ennis,<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> until Peter Milligan's run.\n\nThe start of his run introduces Angie Spatchcock, a fellow magician, and reintroduces his niece, Gemma Constantine, who has also fallen into magic use, to her uncle's consternation. After ridding his sister's house of an evil spirit, and finding out Gemma has gone missing, John returns to London, to find his old colleagues and enemies are all taking sides in the hunt for a mythical item, known as the Red Sepulchre.

John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up [[Swamp Thing#Volume 4|the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward]].

Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other.

Over the course of the first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a [[Babylonia]]n demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the [[Liverpool dockers' strike (1995\u201398)|Liverpool dockers' strike]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Scab|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2501-2}},</ref> gone insane and sought help from [[Shade, The Changing Man]], after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian,<ref>{{cite book|title=Hooked|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2728-7}},</ref> and traveled to India to try to find a way of saving her.<ref>{{cite book|title=India|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2848-8}},</ref> Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.\n\nAfterwards, John's coat (which Gemma sold on [[eBay]]) began to manipulate its various new owners into murder, suicide, or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the U.S., who tried to kill John and Epiphany. During the time the coat was missing, John's magical abilities had begun to go out of control. John eventually resolves this, and he was re-united with his coat. Since this, Gemma and John have a very shaky relationship with one another, and she began a sexual relationship with Epiphany's crime-boss father Terry in order to \"punish\" John. When he confronted her about this relationship though, she told him that she would not stop unless he was able to retrieve her mother's soul from Hell. John agreed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer 276\u2013285|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan}}</ref> In order to get his sister to leave Hell, John agreed to track down her son, his adopted nephew, in Ireland.\n\nOn October 8, 2012, the series was announced as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]'' started at the main imprint of DC comics.<ref name=Cancelled/> By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the [[Three Fates]], who tell him that he will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.\n\nSo John left Epiphany in Ireland and returned to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called \"A Long Journey's End\" surrounded by people, in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Death and Cigarettes|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1401240933}}</ref>\n\n=== Relaunch (2019) ===\n{{out of date|section}}\nIn July 2019, DC announced that ''Hellblazer'' would be relaunched as part of ''[[The Sandman Universe]]'' line of comics.
