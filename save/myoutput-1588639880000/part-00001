He attended [[Tufts College]] in 1943, and became part of the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] stationed in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]  from 1943 to 1945.

He was stationed in [[Pensacola]] and then transferred to [[San Diego, CA]].

He was stationed as a medical doctor aboard  the aircraft carrier [[USS Shangri-La (CV-38)|USS ''Shangri-La'']] until 1957, when he was assigned to the U.S. Naval Air Station in [[Port Lyautey, Morocco]] as Flight Surgeon for VR-24. In 1959, Prather was reassigned to the Bethesda Naval Hospital in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].\n\n==Project RAM==\nIn 1960, Prather was transferred to Project RAM, a government program to test [[prototype]] [[space suits]], at the [[National Naval Medical Center|Naval Medical Research Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]]. He was commissioned to test how the suits worked [[underwater]], and later commissioned to see how the suits would function at extremely high [[altitude]]s.\n\n==The flight==\nOn May 4, 1961, at 7:08 am, Victor Prather, along with [[Malcolm Ross (balloonist)|Cdr.

However, without orders to do so, the crew in a hovering [[helicopter]] lowered a hook. Commander Ross invited Prather to go first, but he declined. Ross stepped into the hook contrary to proper procedure and slipped partially out of it, but he was able to recover without falling completely into the water. A few minutes later, when a hook was lowered to retrieve Prather, he stood on a float attached to the gondola and grasped the rescue line. When he stepped into the hook, the trailing foot pushed the gondola away, and he fell backwards three feet into the water. The helicopter crew assumed that the flight suit was watertight, which it would have been if the face plate was still closed, and did not effect an immediate rescue. Because the face plate was open, Prather's flight suit flooded, and he drowned before Navy divers could rescue him.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://archive.org/details/StratolabTheNavysHighAltitudeBalloonResearch| title = Stratolab: The Navy's High-Altitude Balloon Research| accessdate = 2015-06-19| last = Herman | first = Jan | authorlink = Jan Herman | website = archive.org | date = 1995}}</ref><ref>''Balloon Ride to the Edge of Space'', by Malcolm Ross and Walter Edwards, ''National Geographic Magazine'', November 1961</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.mikesell.info/ahm_balloon_flight.htm| title = Account of Dr. Prather's death at US Navy Strato-Lab Mikesell No.| accessdate = September 1, 2015| author = Alfred Mikesell}}</ref>\n\n==After the flight==\nShortly after Prather's death, President [[John F.
