It can also refer to the combination of [[peer-to-peer networking]], distributed [[command and control (malware)|command and control]], web-based [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[Proxy server|proxy]] redirection used to make malware networks more resistant to discovery and counter-measures. The [[Storm Worm]] (2007) is one of the first malware variants to make use of this technique.\n\nThe basic idea behind Fast flux is to have numerous [[IP address]]es associated with a single [[fully qualified domain name]], where the IP addresses are swapped in and out with extremely high frequency, through changing [[DNS record]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Honeynet Project: How Fast-Flux Service Networks Work | last1 = Danford | last2 = Salusky | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2010-08-23 | url = http://www.honeynet.org/node/132}}</ref>\n\nInternet users may see fast flux used in [[phishing attack]]s linked to criminal organizations, including attacks on [[social network services]].\n\nWhile security researchers have been aware of the technique since at least November 2006, the technique only received wider attention in the security trade press starting from July 2007.\n\n==Single-flux and double-flux==\nThe simplest type of fast flux, named \"single-flux\", is characterized by multiple individual nodes within the network registering and de-registering their addresses as part of the DNS A (address) record list for a single [[Domain name|DNS name]].  This combines [[round robin DNS]] with very short\u2014usually less than five minutes (300s)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/ISP+Spam+Issues#164|title=The Spamhaus Project - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|website=www.spamhaus.org}}</ref> -- TTL ([[time to live]]) values to create a constantly changing list of destination addresses for that single DNS name. The list can be hundreds or thousands of entries long.\n\nA more sophisticated type of fast flux, referred to itself as \"double-flux<ref>Shateel A. Chowdhury, [https://hackersterminal.com/fast-flux-service-networks-ffsn-technique/ \"MALICIOUS USES OF FAST-FLUX SERVICE NETWORKS (FFSN)\"], ''Hackers Terminal'', Apr 29, 2019</ref>\", is characterized by multiple nodes within the network registering and de-registering their addresses as part of the DNS [[NS record|Name Server record]] list for the [[DNS zone]]. This provides an additional layer of redundancy and survivability within the malware network.\n\nWithin a malware attack, the DNS records will normally point to a compromised system that will act as a [[proxy server]]. This method prevents some of the traditionally best defense mechanisms from working \u2014 e.g., IP-based [[access control lists]] (ACLs). The method can also mask the systems of attackers, which will exploit the network through a series of proxies and make it much more difficult to identify the attackers' network. The record will normally point to an IP where bots go for registration, to receive instructions, or to activate attacks. Because the IPs are proxified, it is possible to disguise the originating source of these instructions, increasing the survival rate as IP-based block lists are put in place.\n\nThe most effective measure against fast flux is to take down the domain name it uses.  [[Domain name registrar|Registrar]]s are, however, reluctant to do so because domain owners are legitimate customers for them and there's no worldwide-enforced policy of what constitutes an abuse. In addition to this, [[cybersquatter]]s, including fast flux operators (who typically register new names on demand), are their main source of income. Security experts keep working on measures to ease this process.{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n\nOther measures can be taken by local network administrators. A network admin can force endpoints within their network to only be able to use local DNS servers by blocking all egress DNS traffic, and then blackhole requests for malicious domains at the DNS level. Alternatively, administrators with network devices capable of doing [[OSI_model#Layer_7:_Application_Layer |layer 7]] inspection and intervention can set up policies that reset connections that attempt to resolve or make HTTP requests involving malicious domains.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Avalanche (phishing group)]] - implemented double fast flux on 800,000 domains\n* [[Domain generation algorithm]] - A malware control technique where multiple domain names are generated by victim hosts.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<br />\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://www.spamhaus.org/faq/answers.lasso?section=ISP%20Spam%20Issues#164 Spamhaus explanation of Fast Flux hosting]\n* [http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=1895 Phishing by proxy] SANS Internet Storm Center diary from 2006-11-28 describes use of compromised hosts within botnets making use of fast flux techniques to deliver malware.\n* [http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=3060 MySpace Phish and Drive-by attack vector propagating Fast Flux network growth] SANS Internet Storm Center diary from 2007-06-26 with technical details on FluxBot and fast flux techniques (note: contains links to malicious code).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509123422/http://www.honeynet.org/papers/ff/ Know Your Enemy: Fast-Flux Service Networks; An Ever Changing Enemy] honeynet.org technical article from July 2007 and additional information on fast flux, including \"single-flux\" and \"double-flux\" techniques.\n* [http://syssec.rub.de/research/publications/Measuring-Detecting-Fast-Flux-Service-Networks/ Measuring and Detecting Fast-Flux Service Networks] article by Holz et al. from February 2008 with empirical measurement results on fast flux.\n* [http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11473 Fast flux foils bot-net takedown] SecurityFocus article from 2007-07-09 describing impact of fast flux on botnet counter-measures.\n* [http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=129304&WT.svl=news1_1 Attackers Hide in Fast Flux] darkreading article from 2007-07-17 on the use of fast flux by criminal organizations behind malware.\n* [http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0710.html CRYPTO-GRAM October 15, 2007 issue] Bruce Schneier mentions fast flux as a DNS technique utilized by the Storm Worm.\n* [http://atlas.arbor.net/summary/fastflux ATLAS Summary Report] - Real-time global report of fast flux activity.\n* [http://www.icann.org/committees/security/sac025.pdf SAC 025 SSAC Advisory on Fast Flux Hosting and DNS]\n* [http://gnso.icann.org/issues/fast-flux-hosting/gnso-issues-report-fast-flux-25mar08.pdf GNSO Issues Report on Fast Flux Hosting]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081029043403/http://fluxor.laser.dico.unimi.it/ FluXOR project from Computer and Network Security Lab (LaSeR) @ Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano] (down as 07/27/2012)\n\n{{Domain parking}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fast Flux}}\n[[Category:Domain name system]]\n[[Category:Botnets]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the nuclear breeder reactor|Fast Flux Test Facility}}\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n[[File:Facebook new login system spam fastflux 4.png|thumb|right|200px|DNS [[Robtex]] Analysis of a Fast flux domain]]\n\n'''Fast flux''' is a [[Domain name system|DNS]] technique used by [[botnet]]s to hide [[phishing]] and [[malware]] delivery sites behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies.
