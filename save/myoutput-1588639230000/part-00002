Their third consecutive multi-platinum selling album was ''[[Flesh & Blood (Poison album)|Flesh & Blood]]''.\n\nIn the 1990s following the release of the band's first live album, ''[[Swallow This Live]]'', the band experienced some line up changes and the fall of pop metal with the [[grunge]] movement. But the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Native Tongue (Poison album)|Native Tongue]]'', still achieved Gold status and the band's first compilation album, ''[[Poison's Greatest Hits: 1986\u20131996]]'', went double platinum.\n\nIn the 2000s with the original line up reformed for a greatest hits reunion tour in 1999. The band began the new decade with the release of ''[[Crack a Smile... and More!]]'', followed by the ''[[Power to the People (Poison album)|Power to the People]]'' album.  They released the album, ''[[Hollyweird]]'', in 2002 and in 2006 the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary with ''[[The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock]]'' tour and album, which was certified Gold and marked Poison's return to the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] top 20 charts for the first time since 1993.  Band members have released several solo albums and starred in reality TV shows. After 30 years, the band is still recording music and performing.\n\nSince their debut in 1986, they have released seven studio albums, four live albums, five compilation albums, and have issued 28 singles to radio. \n \nIn 2012 [[VH1]] ranked them at #1 on their list of the \"Top 5 Hair Bands of the '80s\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-06-14/top-5-hair-bands-of-the-80s/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616170239/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-06-14/top-5-hair-bands-of-the-80s/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-06-16|title=Top 5 Hair Bands Of The \u201980s|work=VH1 Music News}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131985)===\n\nPoison was formed in 1983, in [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania]] and consisted of lead vocalist [[Bret Michaels]], guitarist Matt Smith, bassist [[Bobby Dall]] and drummer [[Rikki Rockett]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nMichaels began his performing career with a basement band called Laser and, then, in 1979, joined longtime childhood friend Rockett to form a band called the Spectres. In 1980, Michaels and Rockett teamed up with Smith and Dall to form the band Paris and the group started playing the club circuit, performing mostly rock cover songs in local bars. The group formed a strong local following but in order to further their career the band made the decision to move to Los Angeles on March 6, 1983 and also changed the name of the group from Paris to Poison, after the [[Kix (album)|song of the same name]] by glam metal band [[Kix (band)|Kix]]. Arriving in Los Angeles, the group struggled to survive away from home with no family and no money, but the band was determined to make it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Rise to fame (1986\u20131992)===\n\nPoison promoted themselves up and made the rounds performing in the famous local clubs. During this period, Poison's manager negotiated a deal under which the [[West Hollywood]] club, [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|The Troubadour]], would pay for shows.<ref>{{Cite journal|last =Konow|first = D|title = Bang Your Balls|publisher = Three Rivers Press|year = 2002 |page = 266|postscript =.}}</ref> At this time, Smith, who was about to become a father and was concerned about the band's future, left the band to return home to Pennsylvania. The band auditioned for a replacement guitarist, eventually narrowing down the field to three candidates: [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], who would later join [[Guns N' Roses]]; Steve Silva from the [[Joe Perry Project]]; and New York City-born guitarist [[C.C. DeVille]]. Although Michaels and Dall did not initially get along with him, the band eventually agreed that DeVille's \"fire\" made him the best choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinglegendsmusic.com/library.php?groupID=1386#|title=Living Legends music: Poison|year=2011|access-date=June 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005011927/http://www.livinglegendsmusic.com/library.php?groupID=1386|archive-date=October 5, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMichaels, Rockett, Dall, and DeVille signed to independent label [[Enigma Records]] in 1986 (see [[1986 in music]]) for approximately $30,000. Their debut album, ''[[Look What the Cat Dragged In]]'', was released August 2, 1986. It originally included only one single, \"[[Cry Tough (song)|Cry Tough]]\"; however, ''Look What the Cat Dragged In'' became a surprise success and subsequently spawned three charting hits: \"[[Talk Dirty to Me]]\", \"[[I Want Action]]\", and \"[[I Won't Forget You]]\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last =Konow|first = D|title = Bang Your Balls|publisher = Three Rivers Press|year = 2002 |page = 268|postscript =.}}</ref> The record became the biggest-selling-album in Enigma's history. With heavy rotation on MTV, their debut earned the band tours with fellow glam rockers [[Ratt]], [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], and [[Quiet Riot]], as well as a coveted slot in the Texxas Jam in Dallas. The album ultimately sold 4 million copies worldwide. The band began giving intimate and controversial interviews to rock journalist Judy Wieder at the Hollywood home they all shared in June 1986, before the official release of ''Look What the Cat Dragged In''. Wieder, the first to follow the band closely, circulated their many dicey conversations to the popular rock magazines of the day, including ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'', ''[[Creem]]'', ''[[Rip Magazine]]'', ''[[Rock Express]]'' and ''[[Hit Parader]]'', ensuring enormous visibility for the album's release. In 1987 the band recorded a cover of the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] song \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" for [[Less Than Zero (soundtrack)|soundtrack to ''Less Than Zero'']].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison's second album, ''[[Open Up and Say...Ahh!]]'', was released May 21, 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://godsofrock.com/day-in-rock-history/May/21|title=This Day in Rock History for 21 May|accessdate=October 18, 2009}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the American charts and would ultimately go on to sell 8 million copies worldwide. The album included the band's biggest hit, the No.&nbsp;1 single \"[[Every Rose Has Its Thorn]]\", along with other hits \"[[Nothin' but a Good Time]]\", \"[[Fallen Angel (Poison song)|Fallen Angel]]\", and the [[Loggins and Messina]] cover \"[[Your Mama Don't Dance (Poison song)|Your Mama Don't Dance]]\". The album's initial cover art was controversial, as it depicted a demonic female figure with an obscenely long tongue. A censored version of the cover followed, focusing on the figure's eyes. In 1989, the band released their first video album titled ''[[Sight for Sore Ears]]'' which featured all their music videos from the first two albums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nConflict pursued the band persistently. Bryn Bridenthal, head of publicity at Geffen Records, slapped a $1.1 million lawsuit on the band for drenching her with drinks and a bucket of ice at a music industry party. Then, Sanctuary Music, Poison's former management company, filed a $45.5 million breach of contract suit against the band. Poison retaliated with charges of mismanagement of funds. Michaels' frequent brawling garnered him further lawsuits in [[Atlanta]], Los Angeles and [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001262/Poison.html|title=Poison biography|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nPoison continued their adherence to the \"work hard, play hard\" motto, following up with their third album, ''[[Flesh & Blood (Poison album)|Flesh & Blood]]'', which was released June 21, 1990. It also was highly successful, peaking at No.&nbsp;2 and selling more than 7 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Poison%20&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA \u2013 Gold & Platinum|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php|title=Canadian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> The album's success prompted the impetus for a further world tour. Shedding their big-haired image as they moved into the 1990s, Poison took a more mature approach to their third album. In ''Screamer'' magazine Michaels explained how ''Flesh & Blood'' signaled a change in the band: \"I think that the same way that we shocked people in the beginning with the look, this one might shock them with the music a little bit. This one's the one that's going to show that there's a little bit of another side to the band.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison received a letter from Secretary of Defense [[Dick Cheney]] thanking the band for contributing 20,000 CDs of the album ''Flesh & Blood'' to lift the morale of U.S. Troops during Desert Storm, and their continued support of the Armed Forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moondancejam.com/bands/2008/poison.html|title=Poison bio|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe album also features an alternative cover, as the original featured what appeared to be running ink or possibly blood from a tattoo. (Subsequent versions of this cover removed the \"extra\" ink.) The record went multi-platinum, spawning three gold singles: \"[[Unskinny Bop]]\", \"[[Ride the Wind (Poison song)|Ride the Wind]]\", and the ballad \"[[Something to Believe In (Poison song)|Something To Believe In]]\" which was dedicated to the band's security guard and close friend James Kimo Maano who had died. \"[[Life Goes On (Poison song)|Life Goes On]]\" was the fourth single and the last single released was the title cut, \"[[Flesh and Blood (Poison single)|Flesh & Blood (Sacrifice)]]\". The video of \"Flesh & Blood (Sacrifice)\" was banned from MTV due to its explicit nature, but did surface later in early 1991 in their second video compilation, ''[[Flesh, Blood, & Videotape]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOne of the band's few appearances in the UK was on August 18, 1990 at [[Donington Park|Donington's]] [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in the summer of 1990. [[Whitesnake]] and [[Aerosmith]] headlined with Poison, [[Quireboys]] and [[Thunder (band)|Thunder]] supporting them. This event was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAfter two consecutive years on the road, band members were at each other's throats with personal differences and drug addictions. Poison recorded several performances during its 1990/1991 Flesh & Blood world tour, which were released in November 1991 as the band's fourth album, ''[[Swallow This|Swallow This Live]]''. The double album features live tracks from Poison's first three studio albums and four new studio tracks including the single \"[[So Tell Me Why]]\", which were the last recorded before C.C. DeVille's departure from the band later that year. The band also released their first video concert on VHS from the same tour titled ''[[Swallow This Live: Flesh & Blood World Tour]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Changing times (1993\u20131998)===\nDespite Poison's success, DeVille's [[cocaine]] addiction had begun to cause strife in the band. Conflict between Michaels and DeVille culminated in a fistfight backstage at the 1991 [[MTV]] [[Video Music Awards]], provoked by DeVille's inept live performance. DeVille was fired and replaced by Pennsylvanian guitarist [[Richie Kotzen]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison's fourth album, ''[[Native Tongue (Poison album)|Native Tongue]]'', was released February 8, 1993. It was strongly influenced by Kotzen's fresh songwriting contributions and guitar performance. It marked a change for the band as they abandoned their anthemic party tunes to focus on more serious subjects, and was far more [[blues-rock]] oriented than glam metal. Containing the singles \"[[Stand (Poison song)|Stand]]\" which featured the Los Angeles First A.M.E. Church Choir on backing vocals, \"[[Until You Suffer Some (Fire And Ice)]]\" and \"[[Body Talk (Poison song)|Body Talk]]\", the album received generally positive reviews and did go Gold, but following the arrival of [[grunge]] sales were sluggish compared with the first three albums, selling only two million copies worldwide. The band toured in support of the album, but tensions mounted between Kotzen and the rest of the band. Kotzen's future in the band was doomed when it was discovered that he had become romantically involved with Rockett's then-fianc\u00e9e Deanna Eve. Kotzen was promptly fired, and replaced by [[Blues Saraceno]] in November 1993, who completed the world tour with the band including the famous \"Hollywood Rock\" concerts in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], where they played to over 165,000 people. A concert from the Native Tongue world tour was released on VHS/DVD titled ''[[Seven Days Live]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison began recording its sixth album, ''[[Crack a Smile]]'', in early 1994. Recording was brought to an abrupt halt in May 1994, when Michaels was involved in a car accident where he lost control of his [[Ferrari]]. Michaels suffered a broken nose, ribs, jaw, and fingers and lost four teeth. After his recovery in 1995, the band continued recording the album. The album became shelved shortly after this, with no release date anywhere in sight. Instead, the label opted for a ''[[Poison's Greatest Hits: 1986\u20131996|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation, which featured two new tracks with Saraceno on guitar, \"Sexual Thing\" and \"Lay Your Body Down\". The first Greatest Hits album was released on November 26, 1996 and sold extremely well, going on to reach double platinum status.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAfter several years apart, Michaels and DeVille were able to patch up their differences; and Michaels welcomed DeVille back into Poison in 1996 to replace Saraceno.<ref name=yahoomusic>{{cite web|last=Weber |first=Barry |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/poison/biography/ |title=Poison Biography |publisher=Yahoo!

After Poison's and Michaels' longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, obtained a Federal injunction prohibiting the distribution of an explicit [[sex tape]] that the couple made, an abridged version of the tape appeared on the internet in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity sex tapes|publisher=WCBS-TV|url=http://wcbstv.com/slideshows/celebrity.sex.tapes.20.228647.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211112506/http://wcbstv.com/slideshows/celebrity.sex.tapes.20.228647.html|archivedate=February 11, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMichaels and actor friend [[Charlie Sheen]] co-founded a production company called Sheen Michaels Entertainment. In 1998, Michaels made his acting debut alongside Charlie and [[Martin Sheen]] in the movie ''[[A Letter from Death Row (film)|A Letter from Death Row]]'', which was also written and directed by Michaels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119521/|title=IMDB \u2013 Bret Michaels: A Letter from Death Row  |year= 2010 }}</ref>  Michaels also released his first solo album that year, which was the [[A Letter from Death Row (album)|soundtrack]] to the movie.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Original line up back, new-found popularity, solo albums and reality TV (1999\u20132009)===\nThe ''Greatest Hits'' reunion tour took place in the summer of 1999, with the original lineup. The show at [[DTE Energy Music Theatre|Pine Knob Amphitheater]] in metro [[Detroit]] drew a sell-out crowd of 18,000, and other shows averaged crowds of 12,000. In addition, the band appeared on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''. On March 14, 2000, ''[[Crack a Smile|Crack a Smile...and More!]]'' was finally released, with the single \"[[Shut Up, Make Love]]\" and power ballad \"[[Be the One (Poison song)|Be the One]]\". In addition to the outtakes, live recordings from the 1990 installment of the ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' series were included.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAfter the Poison reunion DeVille soon released his solo album, ''[[Samantha 7]]'', and Michaels released the solo/Poison album ''Show Me Your Hits'' which featured re-recorded Poison classics. The album featured Michaels performing Poison hits in a new way and also featured other artists with Michaels on selected tracks. Poison also released ''[[Power to the People (Poison album)|Power to the People]]'', their first album with DeVille in nine years. The record contained five new studio songs: \"[[Power to the People (Poison Song)|Power to the People]]\" which features a music video, \"Can't Bring Me Down\", \"[[The Last Song (Poison song)|The Last Song]]\", \"Strange\", and \"I Hate Every Bone In Your Body But Mine\", the latter with DeVille on lead vocals for the first time. The remainder of the album featured live performances from the greatest hits reunion tour in 1999. With two Poison albums released in 2000 the band once again hit the road and made it back to back successful tours.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn May 2001 Poison released the web single \"[[Rockstar (Poison song)|Rockstar]]\" as a preview of the upcoming new album and once again went on tour, touring with [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]] on the Glam Slam Metal Jam tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison's sixth full studio album, ''[[Hollyweird]]'', was released on May 21, 2002. It was Poison's first full album of new material with DeVille back in the band. The album was heavily criticised by both critics and fans, feeling it had poor production quality and an unimpressive new sound. One popular site said \"It's muddy, under-produced, badly mixed and features crappy drum and guitar sounds\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.melodicrock.com/reviews/poison-hollyweird.p3|publisher = Melodicrock.com|title = Review|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141210065900/http://www.melodicrock.com/reviews/poison-hollyweird.p3|archivedate = December 10, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Other reviewers were more impressed, such as [[AllMusic]], who declared it \"one of Poison's best records, if not their best\".<ref name=Hollyweird>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hollyweird-mw0000218175 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331045206/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hollyweird-mw0000218175 |archivedate=March 31, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref> [[Bobby Dall]] on [[The Who]] cover single \"Squeeze Box\" stated,\n{{quote|...Actually, that was Rikki's idea.

Michaels also released his second solo album, ''[[Songs of Life (Bret Michaels album)|Songs of Life]]'', which featured singles \"Bittersweet\" and \"Raine\" which featured a music video and was dedicated to his daughter. On January 7 that year, after almost 20 years with Poison, Rockett released his first solo album, ''[[Glitter 4 Your Soul]]'', which was distributed online.

The two would later form Rockett Drum Works, along with former [[Guns N' Roses]] drummer [[Steven Adler]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAfter a year off, Poison returned to the music scene. They celebrated their 20th anniversary with a \"20 Years Of Rock\" world tour in the summer of 2006, with fellow rockers [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] and [[Endeverafter]] opening. The tour swiftly became one of the most successful tours of 2006 in the U.S., averaging about 10,000 people per night. To complement it, the band had released an anniversary compilation album ''[[The Best Of Poison: 20 Years Of Rock]]'', in April that year. The album also features a new single, a cover of [[Grand Funk Railroad]]'s \"[[We're an American Band (song)|We're An American Band]]\", produced by [[Don Was]] and also features a music video. The compilation debuted at No.&nbsp;17 with a first week sales total of 39,721, which marked Poison's return to the top 20 charts for the first time since 1993.\n\nOn August 1, 2006, Capitol Records released remastered versions of the first three Poison albums: ''[[Look What the Cat Dragged In]]'', ''[[Open Up and Say...Ahh!]]'' and ''[[Flesh and Blood (Poison album)|Flesh and Blood]]'', in honor of Poison's 20th anniversary.

Ahh!]]'', which was certified 5\u00d7 platinum in the US. Their third consecutive multi-platinum selling album was ''[[Flesh & Blood (Poison album)|Flesh & Blood]]''.\n\nIn the 1990s following the release of the band's first live album, ''[[Swallow This Live]]'', the band experienced some line up changes and the fall of pop metal with the [[grunge]] movement. But the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Native Tongue (Poison album)|Native Tongue]]'', still achieved Gold status and the band's first compilation album, ''[[Poison's Greatest Hits: 1986\u20131996]]'', went double platinum.\n\nIn the 2000s with the original line up reformed for a greatest hits reunion tour in 1999. The band began the new decade with the release of ''[[Crack a Smile... and More!]]'', followed by the ''[[Power to the People (Poison album)|Power to the People]]'' album.  They released the album, ''[[Hollyweird]]'', in 2002 and in 2006 the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary with ''[[The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock]]'' tour and album, which was certified Gold and marked Poison's return to the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] top 20 charts for the first time since 1993.  Band members have released several solo albums and starred in reality TV shows. After 30 years, the band is still recording music and performing.\n\nSince their debut in 1986, they have released seven studio albums, four live albums, five compilation albums, and have issued 28 singles to radio. \n \nIn 2012 [[VH1]] ranked them at #1 on their list of the \"Top 5 Hair Bands of the '80s\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-06-14/top-5-hair-bands-of-the-80s/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616170239/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-06-14/top-5-hair-bands-of-the-80s/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-06-16|title=Top 5 Hair Bands Of The \u201980s|work=VH1 Music News}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131985)===\n\nPoison was formed in 1983, in [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania]] and consisted of lead vocalist [[Bret Michaels]], guitarist Matt Smith, bassist [[Bobby Dall]] and drummer [[Rikki Rockett]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nMichaels began his performing career with a basement band called Laser and, then, in 1979, joined longtime childhood friend Rockett to form a band called the Spectres. In 1980, Michaels and Rockett teamed up with Smith and Dall to form the band Paris and the group started playing the club circuit, performing mostly rock cover songs in local bars. The group formed a strong local following but in order to further their career the band made the decision to move to Los Angeles on March 6, 1983 and also changed the name of the group from Paris to Poison, after the [[Kix (album)|song of the same name]] by glam metal band [[Kix (band)|Kix]]. Arriving in Los Angeles, the group struggled to survive away from home with no family and no money, but the band was determined to make it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Rise to fame (1986\u20131992)===\n\nPoison promoted themselves up and made the rounds performing in the famous local clubs. During this period, Poison's manager negotiated a deal under which the [[West Hollywood]] club, [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|The Troubadour]], would pay for shows.<ref>{{Cite journal|last =Konow|first = D|title = Bang Your Balls|publisher = Three Rivers Press|year = 2002 |page = 266|postscript =.}}</ref> At this time, Smith, who was about to become a father and was concerned about the band's future, left the band to return home to Pennsylvania. The band auditioned for a replacement guitarist, eventually narrowing down the field to three candidates: [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], who would later join [[Guns N' Roses]]; Steve Silva from the [[Joe Perry Project]]; and New York City-born guitarist [[C.C. DeVille]]. Although Michaels and Dall did not initially get along with him, the band eventually agreed that DeVille's \"fire\" made him the best choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinglegendsmusic.com/library.php?groupID=1386#|title=Living Legends music: Poison|year=2011|access-date=June 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005011927/http://www.livinglegendsmusic.com/library.php?groupID=1386|archive-date=October 5, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMichaels, Rockett, Dall, and DeVille signed to independent label [[Enigma Records]] in 1986 (see [[1986 in music]]) for approximately $30,000. Their debut album, ''[[Look What the Cat Dragged In]]'', was released August 2, 1986. It originally included only one single, \"[[Cry Tough (song)|Cry Tough]]\"; however, ''Look What the Cat Dragged In'' became a surprise success and subsequently spawned three charting hits: \"[[Talk Dirty to Me]]\", \"[[I Want Action]]\", and \"[[I Won't Forget You]]\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last =Konow|first = D|title = Bang Your Balls|publisher = Three Rivers Press|year = 2002 |page = 268|postscript =.}}</ref> The record became the biggest-selling-album in Enigma's history. With heavy rotation on MTV, their debut earned the band tours with fellow glam rockers [[Ratt]], [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], and [[Quiet Riot]], as well as a coveted slot in the Texxas Jam in Dallas. The album ultimately sold 4 million copies worldwide. The band began giving intimate and controversial interviews to rock journalist Judy Wieder at the Hollywood home they all shared in June 1986, before the official release of ''Look What the Cat Dragged In''. Wieder, the first to follow the band closely, circulated their many dicey conversations to the popular rock magazines of the day, including ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'', ''[[Creem]]'', ''[[Rip Magazine]]'', ''[[Rock Express]]'' and ''[[Hit Parader]]'', ensuring enormous visibility for the album's release. In 1987 the band recorded a cover of the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] song \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" for [[Less Than Zero (soundtrack)|soundtrack to ''Less Than Zero'']].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison's second album, ''[[Open Up and Say...Ahh!]]'', was released May 21, 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://godsofrock.com/day-in-rock-history/May/21|title=This Day in Rock History for 21 May|accessdate=October 18, 2009}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the American charts and would ultimately go on to sell 8 million copies worldwide. The album included the band's biggest hit, the No.&nbsp;1 single \"[[Every Rose Has Its Thorn]]\", along with other hits \"[[Nothin' but a Good Time]]\", \"[[Fallen Angel (Poison song)|Fallen Angel]]\", and the [[Loggins and Messina]] cover \"[[Your Mama Don't Dance (Poison song)|Your Mama Don't Dance]]\". The album's initial cover art was controversial, as it depicted a demonic female figure with an obscenely long tongue. A censored version of the cover followed, focusing on the figure's eyes. In 1989, the band released their first video album titled ''[[Sight for Sore Ears]]'' which featured all their music videos from the first two albums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nConflict pursued the band persistently. Bryn Bridenthal, head of publicity at Geffen Records, slapped a $1.1 million lawsuit on the band for drenching her with drinks and a bucket of ice at a music industry party. Then, Sanctuary Music, Poison's former management company, filed a $45.5 million breach of contract suit against the band. Poison retaliated with charges of mismanagement of funds. Michaels' frequent brawling garnered him further lawsuits in [[Atlanta]], Los Angeles and [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001262/Poison.html|title=Poison biography|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nPoison continued their adherence to the \"work hard, play hard\" motto, following up with their third album, ''[[Flesh & Blood (Poison album)|Flesh & Blood]]'', which was released June 21, 1990. It also was highly successful, peaking at No.&nbsp;2 and selling more than 7 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Poison%20&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA \u2013 Gold & Platinum|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php|title=Canadian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> The album's success prompted the impetus for a further world tour. Shedding their big-haired image as they moved into the 1990s, Poison took a more mature approach to their third album. In ''Screamer'' magazine Michaels explained how ''Flesh & Blood'' signaled a change in the band: \"I think that the same way that we shocked people in the beginning with the look, this one might shock them with the music a little bit. This one's the one that's going to show that there's a little bit of another side to the band.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison received a letter from Secretary of Defense [[Dick Cheney]] thanking the band for contributing 20,000 CDs of the album ''Flesh & Blood'' to lift the morale of U.S. Troops during Desert Storm, and their continued support of the Armed Forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moondancejam.com/bands/2008/poison.html|title=Poison bio|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe album also features an alternative cover, as the original featured what appeared to be running ink or possibly blood from a tattoo. (Subsequent versions of this cover removed the \"extra\" ink.) The record went multi-platinum, spawning three gold singles: \"[[Unskinny Bop]]\", \"[[Ride the Wind (Poison song)|Ride the Wind]]\", and the ballad \"[[Something to Believe In (Poison song)|Something To Believe In]]\" which was dedicated to the band's security guard and close friend James Kimo Maano who had died. \"[[Life Goes On (Poison song)|Life Goes On]]\" was the fourth single and the last single released was the title cut, \"[[Flesh and Blood (Poison single)|Flesh & Blood (Sacrifice)]]\". The video of \"Flesh & Blood (Sacrifice)\" was banned from MTV due to its explicit nature, but did surface later in early 1991 in their second video compilation, ''[[Flesh, Blood, & Videotape]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOne of the band's few appearances in the UK was on August 18, 1990 at [[Donington Park|Donington's]] [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in the summer of 1990. [[Whitesnake]] and [[Aerosmith]] headlined with Poison, [[Quireboys]] and [[Thunder (band)|Thunder]] supporting them. This event was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAfter two consecutive years on the road, band members were at each other's throats with personal differences and drug addictions. Poison recorded several performances during its 1990/1991 Flesh & Blood world tour, which were released in November 1991 as the band's fourth album, ''[[Swallow This|Swallow This Live]]''. The double album features live tracks from Poison's first three studio albums and four new studio tracks including the single \"[[So Tell Me Why]]\", which were the last recorded before C.C. DeVille's departure from the band later that year. The band also released their first video concert on VHS from the same tour titled ''[[Swallow This Live: Flesh & Blood World Tour]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Changing times (1993\u20131998)===\nDespite Poison's success, DeVille's [[cocaine]] addiction had begun to cause strife in the band. Conflict between Michaels and DeVille culminated in a fistfight backstage at the 1991 [[MTV]] [[Video Music Awards]], provoked by DeVille's inept live performance. DeVille was fired and replaced by Pennsylvanian guitarist [[Richie Kotzen]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison's fourth album, ''[[Native Tongue (Poison album)|Native Tongue]]'', was released February 8, 1993. It was strongly influenced by Kotzen's fresh songwriting contributions and guitar performance. It marked a change for the band as they abandoned their anthemic party tunes to focus on more serious subjects, and was far more [[blues-rock]] oriented than glam metal. Containing the singles \"[[Stand (Poison song)|Stand]]\" which featured the Los Angeles First A.M.E. Church Choir on backing vocals, \"[[Until You Suffer Some (Fire And Ice)]]\" and \"[[Body Talk (Poison song)|Body Talk]]\", the album received generally positive reviews and did go Gold, but following the arrival of [[grunge]] sales were sluggish compared with the first three albums, selling only two million copies worldwide. The band toured in support of the album, but tensions mounted between Kotzen and the rest of the band. Kotzen's future in the band was doomed when it was discovered that he had become romantically involved with Rockett's then-fianc\u00e9e Deanna Eve. Kotzen was promptly fired, and replaced by [[Blues Saraceno]] in November 1993, who completed the world tour with the band including the famous \"Hollywood Rock\" concerts in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], where they played to over 165,000 people. A concert from the Native Tongue world tour was released on VHS/DVD titled ''[[Seven Days Live]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPoison began recording its sixth album, ''[[Crack a Smile]]'', in early 1994. Recording was brought to an abrupt halt in May 1994, when Michaels was involved in a car accident where he lost control of his [[Ferrari]]. Michaels suffered a broken nose, ribs, jaw, and fingers and lost four teeth. After his recovery in 1995, the band continued recording the album.
