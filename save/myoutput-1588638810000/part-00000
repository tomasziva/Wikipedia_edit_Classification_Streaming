It is commonly known as the '''Tasmanian tiger''' because of its striped lower back, or the '''Tasmanian wolf''' because of its [[canid]]-like characteristics. It was native to Tasmania, [[New Guinea]], and the [[Australia (continent)|Australian mainland]].\n\nThe thylacine was relatively shy and nocturnal, with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and [[Pouch (marsupial)|abdominal pouch]] similar to a kangaroo's, and dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, reminiscent of a tiger. The thylacine was a formidable [[apex predator]],<ref name=\"Paddle\">[[#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]]</ref> though exactly how large its prey animals were is disputed. Because of [[convergent evolution]] it displayed a form and [[adaptations]] similar to the [[tiger]] and [[wolf]] of the Northern Hemisphere, even though not related. Its closest living relative is either the [[Tasmanian devil]] or the [[numbat]]. The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes: the other is the [[water opossum]]. The pouch of the male thylacine served as a protective sheath covering the [[Marsupial reproductive system|external reproductive organs]].\n\nThe thylacine had become extinct on the Australian mainland before [[History of Australia before 1901|British settlement]] of the continent, but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, including the [[Tasmanian devil]]. Intensive hunting encouraged by [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat.\n\n==Taxonomic and evolutionary history==\n[[File:Didelphis cynocephala and Didelphis ursina, 1808.jpg|thumb|Tasmanian devil and thylacine, both labelled as members of ''Didelphis'', from Harris' 1808 description.

A few observations were made of the animal in captivity, but only limited, anecdotal evidence exists of the animal's behaviour in the wild. Most observations were made during the day whereas the thylacine was naturally nocturnal. Those observations, made in the twentieth century, may have been atypical as they were of a species already under the stresses that would soon lead to its extinction. Some behavioural characteristics have been extrapolated from the behaviour of its close relative, the Tasmanian devil.\n\nThe thylacine was a [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]] and [[crepuscular]] hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night. Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and secretive, with awareness of the presence of humans and generally avoiding contact, though it occasionally showed inquisitive traits.<ref name=\"sight\">{{Cite journal | last = Heberle | first = G. | year = 1977 | journal = [[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|Sunday Telegraph]] | page = 46 | title = Reports of alleged thylacine sightings in Western Australia | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gregheberle/AdobePDF/Thylacine/ThylacinePaper2004-P1-5.pdf | format = w | access-date = 5 February 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521142704/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gregheberle/AdobePDF/Thylacine/ThylacinePaper2004-P1-5.pdf | archive-date = 21 May 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> At the time, much stigma existed in regard to its \"fierce\" nature; this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture.<ref>[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/largest-private-collection-of-tasmanian-tigers-on-display.htm/ Tasmanian tigers brought to life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312203711/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/largest-private-collection-of-tasmanian-tigers-on-display.htm |date=12 March 2011 }}, Australian Geographic, 24 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nThere is evidence for at least some year-round breeding (cull records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year), although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring.<ref name=\"ABRS\" /> They would produce up to four joeys per litter (typically two or three), carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size.

A 2011 study by the [[University of New South Wales]] using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws. Animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around {{convert|30|kg|lb}} was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than {{convert|5|kg|lb}}. Thus, some researchers believe thylacines only ate small animals such as [[bandicoot]]s and possums, putting them into direct competition with the [[Tasmanian devil]] and the [[tiger quoll]]. However, an earlier study showed that the thylacine had a bite force quotient of 166, similar to that of most quolls; in modern mammalian predators, such a high bite force is almost always associated with predators which routinely take prey as large, or larger than, themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1564077|year = 2005|last1 = Wroe|first1 = S.|title = Bite club: Comparative bite force in big biting mammals and the prediction of predatory behaviour in fossil taxa|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume = 272|issue = 1563|pages = 619\u2013625|last2 = McHenry|first2 = C.|last3 = Thomason|first3 = J.|pmid = 15817436|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2986}}</ref> If the thylacine was indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00844.x| title = Skull mechanics and implications for feeding behaviour in a large marsupial carnivore guild: The thylacine, Tasmanian devil and spotted-tailed quoll| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 285| issue = 4| pages = 292| year = 2011| last1 = Attard | first1 = M.

In fact, the predatory behaviour of the thylacine was probably closer to ambushing felids than to large pursuit canids.\n\nIts [[stomach]] was muscular, and could distend to allow the animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce.<ref name=\"ABRS\" />\n\nIn captivity, thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods, including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as beef, mutton, horse, and occasionally poultry.<ref name=\"P96\">[[#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]], p. 96.</ref> There is a report of a captive thylacine which refused to eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it, but \"ultimately it was persuaded to eat by having the smell of blood from a freshly killed [[wallaby]] put before its nose.\"<ref name=\"P32\">[[#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]], p. 32.</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Berns and Ashwell published comparative [[cortical map]]s of thylacine and [[Tasmanian devil]] brains, showing that the thylacine had a larger, more modularised [[basal ganglion]].

At the time of the first European settlement, the heaviest distributions were in the northeast, northwest and north-midland regions of the state.<ref name=\"AML\" /> They were rarely sighted during this time but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep. This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers. The [[Van Diemen's Land Company]] introduced bounties on the thylacine from as early as 1830, and between 1888 and 1909 the [[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian government]] paid \u00a31 per head (the equivalent of \u00a3100 or more today [when?]) for dead adult thylacines and ten [[shilling]]s for pups. In all, they paid out 2,184 bounties, but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for. Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and [[bounty hunter]]s.<ref name=\"tasparks\" /><ref name=\"Jarvis\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/02/the-obsessive-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger |title=The Obsessive Search for the Tasmanian Tiger Could a global icon of extinction still be alive? |first1=Brooke |last1=Jarvis |date=July 2, 2018 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315204848/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/02/the-obsessive-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger |archive-date=15 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is likely that multiple factors led to its decline and eventual extinction, including competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers,<ref name=\"Boyce\">{{cite journal|author=Boyce, James|year=2006|title=Canine Revolution: The Social and Environmental Impact of the Introduction of the Dog to Tasmania|url= http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/11.1/boyce.html|url-status=dead|journal=Environmental History|volume=11|issue=1|pages=102\u2013129|doi=10.1093/envhis/11.1.102|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090918111654/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/11.1/boyce.html|archivedate=18 September 2009}}</ref> erosion of its habitat, the concurrent extinction of prey species, and a [[wikt:distemper|distemper]]-like disease that affected many captive specimens at the time.<ref name=\"UTAS\" /><ref name=\"P202203\">[[Thylacine#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]], pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> A study from 2012 also found that were it not for an epidemiological influence, the extinction of thylacine would have been at best prevented, at worst postponed. \"The chance of saving the species, through changing public opinion, and the re-establishment of captive breeding, could have been possible.

It is commonly known as the '''Tasmanian tiger''' because of its striped lower back, or the '''Tasmanian wolf''' because of its [[canid]]-like characteristics. It was native to Tasmania, [[New Guinea]], and the [[Australia (continent)|Australian mainland]].\n\nThe thylacine was relatively shy and nocturnal, with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and [[Pouch (marsupial)|abdominal pouch]] similar to a kangaroo's, and dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, reminiscent of a tiger. The thylacine was a formidable [[apex predator]],<ref name=\"Paddle\">[[#Paddle|Paddle (2000)]]</ref> though exactly how large its prey animals were is disputed. Because of [[convergent evolution]] it displayed a form and [[adaptations]] similar to the [[tiger]] and [[wolf]] of the Northern Hemisphere, even though not related. Its closest living relative is either the [[Tasmanian devil]] or the [[numbat]]. The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes: the other is the [[water opossum]]. The pouch of the male thylacine served as a protective sheath covering the [[Marsupial reproductive system|external reproductive organs]].\n\nThe thylacine had become extinct on the Australian mainland before [[History of Australia before 1901|British settlement]] of the continent, but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, including the [[Tasmanian devil]]. Intensive hunting encouraged by [[bounty (reward)|bounties]] is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat.\n\n==Taxonomic and evolutionary history==\n[[File:Didelphis cynocephala and Didelphis ursina, 1808.jpg|thumb|Tasmanian devil and thylacine, both labelled as members of ''Didelphis'', from Harris' 1808 description.

A few observations were made of the animal in captivity, but only limited, anecdotal evidence exists of the animal's behaviour in the wild. Most observations were made during the day whereas the thylacine was naturally nocturnal. Those observations, made in the twentieth century, may have been atypical as they were of a species already under the stresses that would soon lead to its extinction. Some behavioural characteristics have been extrapolated from the behaviour of its close relative, the Tasmanian devil.\n\nThe thylacine was a [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]] and [[crepuscular]] hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night.

A 2011 study by the [[University of New South Wales]] using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws. Animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around {{convert|30|kg|lb}} was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than {{convert|5|kg|lb}}. Thus, some researchers believe thylacines only ate small animals such as [[bandicoot]]s and possums, putting them into direct competition with the [[Tasmanian devil]] and the [[tiger quoll]]. However, an earlier study showed that the thylacine had a bite force quotient of 166, similar to that of most quolls; in modern mammalian predators, such a high bite force is almost always associated with predators which routinely take prey as large, or larger than, themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1564077|year = 2005|last1 = Wroe|first1 = S.|title = Bite club: Comparative bite force in big biting mammals and the prediction of predatory behaviour in fossil taxa|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume = 272|issue = 1563|pages = 619\u2013625|last2 = McHenry|first2 = C.|last3 = Thomason|first3 = J.|pmid = 15817436|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2986}}</ref> If the thylacine was indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00844.x| title = Skull mechanics and implications for feeding behaviour in a large marsupial carnivore guild: The thylacine, Tasmanian devil and spotted-tailed quoll| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 285| issue = 4| pages = 292| year = 2011| last1 = Attard | first1 = M.
