The adjacent communities of [[Sheepshead Bay]], [[Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn|Manhattan Beach]], and [[Brighton Beach]] were settled after [[World War II]] by a large Jewish population, many of whom were immigrants and survivors of the atrocities of the Nazi regime.\n\nThis Memorial Park is the only public Holocaust memorial park in [[New York City]]. It is a New York City-owned park maintained by the Parks Department. The Brooklyn-based non-profit organization \u201cThe Holocaust Memorial Committee\u201d has control over the park's markers.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/holocaust-memorial-park-bt10/history|title=Holocaust Memorial Park Highlights : NYC Parks|website=www.nycgovparks.org}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/hmna-bklyn-hmp.htm|title=hmna/bklyn/hmp|website=www.museumoffamilyhistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bridgeandtunnelclub.com/bigmap/brooklyn/sheepsheadbay/holocaustmemorialpark/index.htm|title=Holocaust Memorial Park, Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|website=www.bridgeandtunnelclub.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Park was first designated as a Holocaust Memorial Park in 1985 by then-Mayor [[Edward I.

Originally consisted of a grove of established London plane trees and a seating area.\nAfter a lengthy planning process led by a local non-profit organization, The Holocaust Memorial Committee, [[Brooklyn Borough President]] [[Howard Golden]] allocated $933,000 toward the construction of a permanent memorial designed and built by the City.\n\nConstruction of the permanent memorial began in 1994 and was dedicated on June 22, 1997, by then-Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] who was joined by Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden, [[Abraham Foxman]], National Director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and a Holocaust survivor, and other officials.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://thmc.org/the_holocaust_memorial_park.html|title=Holocaust Memorial Committee Brooklyn, New York|website=thmc.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jchb.org/neveragain-the-holocaust-memorial-park/|title=Never Again - The Holocaust Memorial Park &#124; JCHB.org|date=January 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/97/sp367-97.html|title=Press Release Archives #367-97 Holocaust Memorial Opening|website=www.nyc.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Design features==\n\nThe memorial designed Landscape architect George Vellonakis consists of a truncated 14 1/2-foot tower sculpture of granite, exposed steel, and a bronze \u201cEternal Flame\u201d on top.
