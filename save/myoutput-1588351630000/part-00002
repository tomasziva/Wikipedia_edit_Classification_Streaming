In the 16th century, India came under the influence of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ([[Mongols]]). [[Babur]], a ruler of the Mongol Timuri empire, established a foothold in the north which paved the way for further expansion by his successors.<ref>MHodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Although the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] has been described as a universalist, most Mughal emperors were oppressive of native Hindu, Buddhist and later Sikh populations.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, pp. 65\u201367.</ref> [[Aurangzeb]] specifically was inclined towards a highly fundamentalist approach.<ref>Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam Vol 3'', 1961, p. 60.</ref>\n\nThe Muslim rulers from Turks to Mughals retained their Islamic identities, and made various attempts at conversion and subjugation of native Hindu populations.

In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the ''dhimmi'' system implemented in [[Islam|Muslim]] countries, they, like all other Christians and also Jews, were accorded certain freedoms. The dhimmi system in the Ottoman Empire was largely based upon the [[Pact of Umar]]. The client status established the rights of the non-Muslims to property, livelihood and freedom of worship but they were in essence treated as [[second-class citizen]]s in the empire and referred to in Turkish as ''[[Giaour|gavours]]'', a pejorative word meaning \"[[infidel]]\" or \"[[unbeliever]]\". The clause of the Pact of Umar which prohibited non-Muslims from building new places of worship was historically imposed on some communities of the Ottoman Empire and ignored in other cases, at discretion of the local authorities.

[[Khaybar]] was the first territory attacked and conquered by Muslims. When the Jews of Khaybar surrendered to Muhammad after a siege, Muhammad allowed them to remain in Khaybar in return for handing over to the Muslims one half their annual produce.<ref name=\"Lewis\">Lewis (1984), pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\n===Pact of Umar===\n{{Main|Pact of Umar}}\nThe [[Pact of Umar]], traditionally believed to be between caliph [[Umar]] and the conquered Jerusalem Christians in the seventh century, was another source of regulations pertaining to dhimmis. However, Western [[orientalism|orientalists]] doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no Arabic and knew nothing of Islam could draft such a document. Academic historians believe the Pact of Umar in the form it is known today was a product of later jurists who attributed it to Umar in order to lend greater authority to their own opinions. The similarities between the Pact of Umar and the [[Theodosian dynasty|Theodosian]] and [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian Codes]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] suggest that perhaps much of the Pact of Umar was borrowed from these earlier codes by later Islamic jurists. At least some of the clauses of the pact mirror the measures first introduced by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]] or by the early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphs.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n==Cultural interactions and cultural differences==\nDuring the Middle Ages, local associations known as ''[[futuwwa]]'' clubs developed across the Islamic lands. There were usually several futuwwah in each town. These clubs catered to varying interests, primarily sports, and might involve distinctive manners of dress and custom. They were known for their hospitality, idealism and loyalty to the group. They often had a militaristic aspect, purportedly for the mutual protection of the membership. These clubs commonly crossed social strata, including among their membership local notables, dhimmi and slaves \u2013 to the exclusion of those associated with the local ruler, or [[Emir|amir]].<ref>[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''[[The Venture of Islam]] Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 2''.
