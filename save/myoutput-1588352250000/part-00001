He fought in the [[Second Boer War]] and also in the [[First World War]], in which he led the [[British Empire]]'s [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF) during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the conquest of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\nThe British succeeded in capturing [[Beersheba]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Jerusalem]] from October to December 1917. His forces occupied the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] during the summer of 1918, then went on to capture northern Palestine and defeat the Ottoman [[Yildirim Army Group]]'s [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Army]] at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], forcing the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth]] and [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh Army]] to retreat towards Damascus. Subsequently, the EEF Pursuit by [[Desert Mounted Corps]] captured [[Damascus]] and advanced into northern [[Syria]].\n\nDuring this pursuit, he commanded [[T. E. Lawrence]] (''\"Lawrence of Arabia\"''), whose campaign with [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal's]] [[Sharifian Army|Arab Sherifial Forces]] assisted the EEF's capture of [[Ottoman Empire]] territory and fought the [[Battle of Aleppo (1918)|Battle of Aleppo]], five days before the [[Armistice of Mudros]] ended the campaign on 30 October 1918. He continued to serve in the region as [[High Commissioner]] for [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] from 1919 until 1925.\n\n==Early life==\nAllenby was born in 1861, the son of Hynman Allenby and Catherine Anne Allenby (n\u00e9e Cane) and was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury College]].<ref name=heath19>Heathcote, p. 19</ref> He had no great desire to be a soldier, and tried to enter the [[Indian Civil Service]] but failed the entry exam.<ref name=heath19/> He sat the exam for the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] in 1880 and was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons]] on 10 May 1882.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=25105|date=9 May 1882|page=2157}}</ref> He joined his regiment in South Africa later that year,<ref name=heath20>Heathcote, p. 20</ref> taking part in the [[Bechuanaland Expedition]] of 1884\u201385.<ref name=Harts>{{Cite book|author=Hart's|title=Annual Army List, 1904.|page=174.

Not deterred, he sat the exam again the next year and passed. Captain [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] of the [[7th Hussars]] also entered the [[Staff College]] at the same time, thus beginning a rivalry between the two that ran until the [[First World War]].<ref name=heath20/> Allenby was more popular with fellow officers, even being made ''Master of the Draghounds'' in preference to Haig who was the better rider; Allenby had already developed a passion for polo.<ref name=heath20/> Their contemporary James Edmonds later claimed that the staff at Staff College thought Allenby dull and stupid but were impressed by a speech that he gave to the Farmers' Dinner, which had in fact been written for him by Edmonds and another.<ref>Reid 2006, p69</ref>\n\nHe was promoted to major on 19 May 1897<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26860|date=8 June 1897|page=3199|nolink=y}}</ref> and was posted to the [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Cavalry Brigade]], then serving in Ireland, as the [[Brigade-Major]] in March 1898.<ref name=heath20/>\n\n==Second Boer War==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899, Allenby returned to his regiment, and the Inniskillings embarked at [[Cobh|Queenstown]] and landed at [[Cape Town]], South Africa, later that year.<ref name=heath20/> He took part in the actions at [[Colesberg]] on 11 January 1900, [[Siege of Kimberley|Klip Drift]] on 15 February 1900 and Dronfield Ridge on 16 February 1900,<ref name=heath20/> and was [[mentioned in despatches]] by the commander-in-chief, [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] on 31 March 1900.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 27282 |page= 846 |date= 8 February 1901 |nolink= y}}</ref>\n\nMajor Allenby was appointed to command the squadron of [[New South Wales Lancers]], who were camped beside the [[Australian Light Horse]] outside [[Bloemfontein]].

At the outbreak of war in August 1914, a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to France. It consisted of four infantry divisions and one [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|cavalry division]], the latter commanded by Allenby. The cavalry division first saw action in semi-chaotic circumstances covering the retreat after the [[Battle of Mons]] opposing the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s invasion of France. One of Allenby's subordinates claimed at the time: \"He cannot explain verbally, with any lucidity at all, what his plans are\".<ref name=urban219>Urban, 2005 p. 219</ref> When a headquarters officer asked why [[Hubert Gough]]'s cavalry brigade was miles from where it was supposed to be, he received the reply: \"He told me he was getting as far away from the Bull as possible. It was a most scandalous affair, and he was in an almost open rebellion against Allenby at the time\".<ref name=urban219/><ref group=\"Note\">During the retreat from Mons, Allenby clashed with Gough, his subordinate then commanding [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Cavalry Brigade]]. Gough wrote in 1930 that \"we were kept in such ignorance of the entire situation\" by \"that stupid man Allenby\", and he claimed to have not known the whole story of what had been going on until he read [[Horace Smith-Dorrien|Smith-Dorrien]]'s memoirs. [Farrar-Hockley 1975, p. 352]</ref> The division distinguished itself under Allenby's direction in the subsequent fighting, with minimal resources at its disposal, at the [[First Battle of Ypres]].<ref name=heath21/>\n\nAllenby was promoted to temporary [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]] on 10 October 1914.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28981|date=20 November 1914|page=9540|nolink=y}}</ref> As the BEF was expanded in size to two Armies, he was rewarded by being made commander of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]].<ref name=heath21/> On 6 May 1915, Allenby voluntarily left the Cavalry Arm to take up command of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] which was engaged at that moment in severe fighting at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. Commanding a corps seemed to make Allenby's bad temper even worse where anything from a split infinitive in a staff paper to discovering a corpse in the field without the tin helmet that Allenby ordered his men to wear sent Allenby off into a rage.<ref name=urban219/> The V Corps was victorious in defeating the German assault but incurred controversially heavy losses in the process through Allenby's tactical policy of continual [[counter-attack]]s at the German attacking force. In September 1915, V Corps attempted a diversion of German strength to facilitate the concurrent British [[Battle of Loos|offensive at Loos]]. They executed a minor attack in the Hooge Sector in the Ypres Salient under Allenby's direction, which once again incurred substantial losses to its units involved in the affair.<ref>Gardner, pp. 66\u2013115</ref> In October 1915, Allenby was promoted to lead the [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|British Third Army]],<ref name=heath21/> being made lieutenant-general (substantive rank) on 1 January 1916.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29438 |supp=y|date=11 January 1916|page=568|nolink=y}}</ref> In mid-Summer 1916, he was the Army Commander in support of the launch of the [[Battle of the Somme]] offensive, with responsibility for the abortive assault by 3rd Army troops on the trench fortress of the [[Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais|Gommecourt]] salient, which failed with severe casualties to the units under his command in the operation. By this time in 1916, [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] who was one of Allenby's staff officers and supporters, wrote that Allenby's temper seemed to \"confirm the legend that 'the Bull' was merely a bad-tempered, obstinate hot-head, a 'thud-and-blunder' general\".<ref name=urban219/> Allenby harboured doubts about the leadership of the commander of the BEF, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]], but refused to allow any of his officers to say anything critical about Haig.<ref>Urban, 2005 p. 220</ref> However, despite Allenby's rages and obsession with applying the rules in a way that often seemed petty, Allenby's staff officers found an intellectually curious general who was interested in finding new ways of breaking the stalemate.<ref name=urban221>Urban, 2005 p. 221</ref> [[J. F. C. Fuller]] called Allenby \"a man I grew to like and respect\", a man who always asked his staff if they had any new ideas about how to win the war.<ref name=urban221/> Allenby had wider interests than many other British generals, reading books on every conceivable subject from botany to poetry and was noted for his critical intellect.<ref name=urban221/> An officer who had dinner with Allenby at his headquarters in a French ch\u00e2teau recalled:\n\n<blockquote>His keen grey-blue eyes, under heavy brows, search the face while he probes the mind with sharp, almost staccato questions about everything under the sun except what is expected. He cannot suffer fools gladly and demands an unequivocal affirmative or negative to every query he makes. He has a habit of asking questions on the most abstruse subjects, and an unpleasant knack of catching out anyone who gives an evasive answer for the sake of politeness.<ref name=urban222>Urban, 2005 p. 222</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany of Allenby's officers believed that he was incapable of any emotion except rage, but he was a loving father and husband who was intensely concerned about his only child, Michael, who was serving at the front.<ref name=urban222/> Before Allenby went to bed every night, Allenby would enter the office of the officer who took the daily casualty returns, ask \"Have you any news of my little boy today?\" and after the officer replied \"No news sir\", Allenby would then go to bed a reassured man.<ref name=urban222/> His son, a lieutenant in the [[Royal Horse Artillery]], was to die of wounds on 29 July 1917 aged 19, at [[Coxyde]], Belgium.<ref name=Geni>[https://www.geni.com/people/Lt-Horace-Michael-Hynman-Allenby-MC/6000000030111165150 Geni: Lt. Horace Michael Hynman Allenby']</ref>\n\nIn early 1917, Allenby was ordered by Haig to start preparations for a major offensive around the city of [[Arras]].<ref name=urban222/> During his planning Allenby insisted upon putting into practice many of the ideas that his staff officers had offered.<ref name=urban223>Urban, 2005 p. 223</ref> Allenby rejected the normal week-long bombardment of the German trenches before making an assault, instead planning on a 48-hour bombardment before the assault went ahead.<ref name=urban223/> In addition, Allenby had made careful plans to control traffic in the rear to prevent traffic jams that would block his logistics, a second echelon behind the first echelon that would only be sent in to exploit successes, tunnels to bring up new divisions behind the German lines while avoiding German fire and finally new weapons like tanks and aircraft were to play prominent roles in the offensive.<ref name=urban223/> In March 1917, the Germans pulled back to the [[Hindenburg Line]], which led Allenby to argue that the planned offensive in the Arras sector in April should be changed, a request Haig refused.<ref name=urban223/> Despite refusing Allenby's request for more time to change his plans, Haig informed him that the entire responsibility for the failure of the Arras offensive would rest with him.<ref name=urban224>Urban, 2005 p. 224</ref> As the Zero Hour for the offensive at 5: 30 am on 9 April 1917 approached, Allenby was thus unusually worried as he knew his entire career was in the balance.<ref name=urban224/>\n\nAt first, the Arras offensive went well with the Third Army breaking through the German lines and advancing three and a half miles in one day.<ref>Urban, 2005 p. 224-225.</ref> In a letter to his wife on 10 April 1917, Allenby wrote: \"I had a very big success yesterday. I won all along the line; killed a host of Boche and took over 7,500 prisoners...We have, at last, brought off what I been working on all winter. My staff has been splendid\".<ref>Urban, 2005 p. 225</ref> There were weeks of heavy fighting during 3rd Army's offensive at the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] in the Spring of the 1917, where an initial breakthrough had deteriorated into trench-fighting positional warfare\u2014once more with heavy casualties to 3rd Army's units involved. Allenby lost the confidence of his [[Commander-in-chief]], Haig. He was promoted to full General on 3 June 1917,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30111 |supp=y|date=1 June 1917|page=5463|nolink=y}}</ref> but he was replaced at the head of 3rd Army on 9 June 1917 and returned to England.<ref name=heath21/>\n\n===Egypt and Palestine===\n[[File:General Allenby.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Allenby from journal \"The War\" c. 1917]]\n\n==== British War Cabinet debate ====\n{{Main|Sinai and Palestine campaign}}\n\nThe British War Cabinet was divided in debate in May 1917 over the allocation of British resources between the Western Front and other fronts, with Allied victory over Germany far from certain. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] and [[Maurice Hankey|Hankey]] recommended that Britain seize ground in the Middle East. Lloyd George wanted more effort on other fronts, but also wanted a commander \"of the dashing type\" to replace Sir [[Archibald Murray]] in command of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]]. Smuts refused the command (late May) unless promised resources for a decisive victory. Lloyd George appointed Allenby to the role.<ref name=heath21/>\n\n==== British change in mindset ====\nWhen Allenby received this assignment, he first believed it was a joke, because he was still on the thought that the war would be decided on the Western Front. Instead, this \"joke\" represented a change in mindset in many British leaders. Previously, leaders were concerned that taking over Palestine would divide it and leave it for other countries to take, but repeated losses to the Turkish Army and the stalled Western Front left many leaders including Lloyd George to believe that taking Palestine was the right decision.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Neiberg|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael S.

Allenby's exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed<!---what does this sentence mean??--->.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp155-9</ref>\n\n==== Palestine Campaign ====\nAllenby  arrived on 27 June 1917. On 31 July 1917 he received a telegram from his wife saying that Michael Allenby had been killed in action, leading to Allenby's break down in tears in public while he recited a poem by [[Rupert Brooke]].<ref name=\"urban228\">Urban, 2005 p. 228</ref> Afterwards, Allenby kept his grief to himself and his wife, and instead threw himself into his work with icy determination, working very long hours without a break.<ref name=\"urban222\" /> Wavell recalled: \"He went on with his work and asked no sympathy. Only those who stood close to him knew how heavy the blow had been, how nearly it had broken him, and what courage it had taken to withstand it\".<ref name=\"urban228\" /> Allenby assessed the Turkish Army's fighting force that he was facing to be 46,000 rifles and 2,800 sabres, and estimated that he could take Jerusalem with 7 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions. He did not feel that there was a sufficient military case to do so, and felt that he would need reinforcements to advance further. Allenby understood the problems posed by logistics in the desert and spent much time working to ensure his soldiers would be well supplied at all times, especially with water.<ref name=\"urban229\">Urban, 2005 p. 229</ref> The logistics of getting water to the soldiers and through the desert is thought to be the biggest challenge and accomplishment Allenby made in the Middle East campaign.<ref name=\":1\">Neiberg, Michael S. the Henry L. Stimson Chair and Professor of History in the Department of National Security and Strategy and WWI and II Author. Personal Interview. 2 February 2016.</ref> Allenby also saw the importance of good medical treatment and insisted that proper medical facilities be created to treat all of the diseases common to the Middle East like [[ophthalmia]] and enteric fever.<ref name=\"urban229\" />  Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but the extent of his advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in \"secret and personal\" notes (1 and 10 August).<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp157-9</ref>\n\nAllenby quickly won the respect of his troops by making frequent visits to the EEF's front-line units, in a marked change from the leadership style of his predecessor Murray, who had commanded primarily from [[Cairo]]. Allenby moved the EEF's [[Headquarters|GHQ]] from the Egyptian capital city to [[Rafah]], nearer to the front lines at [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and re-organized the disparate forces of the EEF into a three primary corps order of battle: [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX]], [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI]], and the [[Desert Mounted Corps]]. He also approved the utilisation of Arabic irregular forces which were operating at that time to the Turkish Army's open left flank in the Arabian interior, under the direction of a young British Army Intelligence officer named [[T. E. Lawrence]]. He sanctioned \u00a3200,000 a month for Lawrence to facilitate his work amongst the tribes involved.<ref>Hughes, chapter 5</ref>\n\nIn early October 1917, Robertson asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza-[[Beersheba]] line (30 miles wide) to the [[Jaffa]]-[[Jerusalem]] line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat. Allenby's estimate was that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig's forces went on the defensive) and that he might face 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions. Yet, in private letters, Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem.<!---the following phrase has been cut because it makes no sense: and in the event the Germans sent only 3 battalions to Palestine, and Turkish strength there was only 21,000 (out of 110,000 on all fronts) facing 100,000 British Empire troops.---><ref>Woodward, 1998, pp159-162</ref>\n\nHaving reorganised his regular forces, Allenby won the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] (31 October \u2013 7 November 1917) by surprising the defenders with an [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|attack at Beersheba.]]<ref name=\"heath22\" /> The first step in capturing Beersheba was to send out false radio messages prompting the Turkish forces to think Britain was going to attack Gaza. After that, one brave intelligence officer, Colonel [[Richard Meinertzhagen]], rode right up to the Turkish line, barely evading capture.

I, therefore, here now proclaim it to be under martial law, under which form of administration it will remain so long as military considerations make necessary.\n  However, lest any of you be alarmed by reason of your experience at the hands of the enemy who has retired, I hereby inform you that it is my desire that every person pursue his lawful business without fear of interruption.''\n  Furthermore, since your city is regarded with affection by the adherents of three of the great religions of mankind and its soil has been consecrated by the prayers and pilgrimages of multitudes of devout people of these three religions for many centuries, therefore, do I make it known to you that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are sacred.\n  Guardians have been established at [[Bethlehem]] and on [[Rachel's Tomb]].

By early 1918, 50,000 Turks in the theatre were tying down a [[British Empire]] ration strength of over 400,000 (of whom almost half were non-combatants, and 117,471 were British troops).<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp164, 167</ref>\n\nSmuts was sent to Egypt to confer with Allenby and [[William Raine Marshall|Marshall]], with Robertson's clash with the government now moving to its final stages, and the new [[Supreme War Council]] at Versailles drawing up plans for more efforts in the Middle East. Allenby told Smuts of Robertson's private instructions (sent by hand of [[Walter Kirke]], appointed by Robertson as Smuts' adviser) that there was no merit in any further advance. Allenby worked with Smuts to draw up plans to reach [[Haifa]] by June and Damascus by the autumn, reinforced by 3 divisions from [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]]. The speed of the advance was limited by the need to lay fresh rail track. This met with War Cabinet approval (6 March 1918).<ref name=\"Woodward, 1998, pp165-8\">Woodward, 1998, pp165-8</ref>\n\nThe German [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front meant that Allenby was without reinforcements after his forces failed to capture [[Amman]] in March and April 1918. He halted the offensive in the spring of 1918 and had to send 60,000 men to the Western Front, although the Dominion Prime Ministers in the [[Imperial War Cabinet]] continued to demand a strong commitment to the Middle East in case Germany could not be beaten.<ref name=\"Woodward, 1998, pp165-8\"/>\n\nNew troops from the British Empire (specifically Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[India]], and South Africa) led to the resumption of operations in August 1918. Following an extended series of deceptive moves, the Ottoman line was broken at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] (19\u201321 September 1918), and the Allied cavalry passed through and blocked the Turkish retreat. The EEF then advanced at an impressive rate, as high as 60 miles in 55 hours for cavalry, and infantry slogging 20 miles a day and encountering minimal resistance. Damascus fell on 1 October, [[Homs]] on 16 October, and [[Aleppo]] on 25 October. With the threat of Asia Minor being invaded, the Ottoman Empire capitulated on 30 October 1918 with the signing of the [[Armistice of Mudros]].<ref name=heath22/>\n\n==Governor of Egypt==\n[[File:Ed-Allenby.jpg|thumb|left|Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby (1861\u20131936), British Field Marshal by [[Henry Walter Barnett]]]]\nAllenby was made a [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 31 July 1919,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31484 |supp=y|date=31 July 1919|page=9835|nolink=y}}</ref> and created '''Viscount Allenby''' of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]] and of [[Felixstowe]] in the [[Suffolk|County of Suffolk]] on 7 October.<ref name=heath23>Heathcote, p. 23</ref>\n\nHis appointment in 1919 as Special High Commissioner of Egypt came as the country was being disrupted by [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|demonstrations against British rule]]. It had been under [[Martial Law]] since 1914 and several of Egyptian leaders, including [[Saad Zaghlul]], had been exiled to Malta.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, volume 8, 1930. pp 96,97</ref>\n\nThese deportations had led to rioting across the country, with Cairo isolated. Allenby's first response was conciliatory. He persuaded the Colonial Office to allow Zaghlul and his delegation, [[wafd]], to travel to France. Their intention was to present the Egyptian case to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] but they received no official recognition and returned to Egypt in failure.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, volume 8, 1930. p 97</ref>\n\nIn early 1921 there were more riots and demonstrations that were blamed on Zaghlul. This time Allenby ordered that Zaghlul and five other leaders be deported to the Seychelles. Sixteen rioters were executed. The following year Allenby travelled to London with proposals which he insisted be implemented. They included the end of Martial Law, the drafting of an Egyptian Constitution and the return of Zaglul. Progress was made: Egypt was granted [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|limited self-government]], and a [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|draft constitution]] was published in October 1922 leading to the formation of a Zaghlul government in January 1924. The following November the commander of British forces in Egypt and Sudan, [[Lee Stack]], was assassinated in Cairo. Allenby's response was draconian and included a humiliating \u00a3500,000 fine to be paid by the Egyptian Government. In May 1925, Allenby resigned and returned to England.<ref>Encyclopaedia Britanica, volume 8, 1930. pp 97-99</ref><ref name=heath23/>\n\n==Retirement==\nAllenby was appointed Honorary Colonel of the [[Cinque Ports Fortress Royal Engineers]] on 12 September 1925<ref>''Army Lists''.</ref> and made [[Captain of Deal Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastkent.freeuk.com/deal/castle/captains.htm|title=Captains of Deal Castle|publisher=East Kent freeuk|accessdate= 10 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nMurray and Allenby were invited to give lectures at Aldershot in 1931 about the Palestine Campaign. Exchanging letters beforehand, Murray asked whether it had been worth risking the Western Front (in the autumn of 1917) to transfer troops to Palestine. Allenby avoided that question, but commented that in 1917 and into the spring of 1918 it had been far from clear that the Allies were going to win the war. Russia was dropping out, but the Americans were not yet present in strength. France and Italy were weakened and might have been persuaded to make peace, perhaps by Germany giving up Belgium or Alsace-Lorraine, or Austria-Hungary giving up the Trentino. In those circumstances, Germany was likely to be left in control of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, and it had been sensible for Britain to grab some land in the Middle East to block Germany's route to India. Allenby's views mirrored those of the War Cabinet at the time.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp212</ref>\n\nAllenby went to [[Patagonia]] for a last fishing trip, aged 74, to see if the salmon really were as big as those in the Tay.<ref>Reid 2006, p67</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHe died suddenly from a ruptured [[cerebral aneurysm]] on 14 May 1936 at his house in Kensington, London at the age of 75 years.

However, the film is believed lost.<ref>Aitken, p. 146</ref>\n\nThe epic film ''Lawrence of Arabia'' depicts the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I. Allenby is given a major part in it and is portrayed by [[Jack Hawkins]] in one of his best-known roles. Screenwriter Bolt called Allenby a \"very considerable man\" and hoped to depict him sympathetically.<ref>\"As I wrote the part I admired (Allenby) exceedingly and tried to show him as performing his duty... perfectly and without relish.\" Quoted in [[Adrian Turner]], ''Robert Bolt: Scenes from Two Lives'' (London: Hutchinson, 1998), p. 509.</ref> Nonetheless, many view Allenby's portrayal as negative.<ref>Wilson, Jeremy.

Allenby''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|GCMG|GCVO}} (23 April 1861&nbsp;\u2013 14 May 1936) was an English soldier and British Imperial Governor. He fought in the [[Second Boer War]] and also in the [[First World War]], in which he led the [[British Empire]]'s [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF) during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the conquest of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\nThe British succeeded in capturing [[Beersheba]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Jerusalem]] from October to December 1917. His forces occupied the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] during the summer of 1918, then went on to capture northern Palestine and defeat the Ottoman [[Yildirim Army Group]]'s [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Army]] at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], forcing the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth]] and [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh Army]] to retreat towards Damascus. Subsequently, the EEF Pursuit by [[Desert Mounted Corps]] captured [[Damascus]] and advanced into northern [[Syria]].\n\nDuring this pursuit, he commanded [[T. E. Lawrence]] (''\"Lawrence of Arabia\"''), whose campaign with [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal's]] [[Sharifian Army|Arab Sherifial Forces]] assisted the EEF's capture of [[Ottoman Empire]] territory and fought the [[Battle of Aleppo (1918)|Battle of Aleppo]], five days before the [[Armistice of Mudros]] ended the campaign on 30 October 1918. He continued to serve in the region as [[High Commissioner]] for [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] from 1919 until 1925.\n\n==Early life==\nAllenby was born in 1861, the son of Hynman Allenby and Catherine Anne Allenby (n\u00e9e Cane) and was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury College]].<ref name=heath19>Heathcote, p. 19</ref> He had no great desire to be a soldier, and tried to enter the [[Indian Civil Service]] but failed the entry exam.<ref name=heath19/> He sat the exam for the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] in 1880 and was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons]] on 10 May 1882.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=25105|date=9 May 1882|page=2157}}</ref> He joined his regiment in South Africa later that year,<ref name=heath20>Heathcote, p. 20</ref> taking part in the [[Bechuanaland Expedition]] of 1884\u201385.<ref name=Harts>{{Cite book|author=Hart's|title=Annual Army List, 1904.|page=174.

Not deterred, he sat the exam again the next year and passed. Captain [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] of the [[7th Hussars]] also entered the [[Staff College]] at the same time, thus beginning a rivalry between the two that ran until the [[First World War]].<ref name=heath20/> Allenby was more popular with fellow officers, even being made ''Master of the Draghounds'' in preference to Haig who was the better rider; Allenby had already developed a passion for polo.<ref name=heath20/> Their contemporary James Edmonds later claimed that the staff at Staff College thought Allenby dull and stupid but were impressed by a speech that he gave to the Farmers' Dinner, which had in fact been written for him by Edmonds and another.<ref>Reid 2006, p69</ref>\n\nHe was promoted to major on 19 May 1897<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26860|date=8 June 1897|page=3199|nolink=y}}</ref> and was posted to the [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Cavalry Brigade]], then serving in Ireland, as the [[Brigade-Major]] in March 1898.<ref name=heath20/>\n\n==Second Boer War==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899, Allenby returned to his regiment, and the Inniskillings embarked at [[Cobh|Queenstown]] and landed at [[Cape Town]], South Africa, later that year.<ref name=heath20/> He took part in the actions at [[Colesberg]] on 11 January 1900, [[Siege of Kimberley|Klip Drift]] on 15 February 1900 and Dronfield Ridge on 16 February 1900,<ref name=heath20/> and was [[mentioned in despatches]] by the commander-in-chief, [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] on 31 March 1900.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 27282 |page= 846 |date= 8 February 1901 |nolink= y}}</ref>\n\nMajor Allenby was appointed to command the squadron of [[New South Wales Lancers]], who were camped beside the [[Australian Light Horse]] outside [[Bloemfontein]]. Both men and horses suffered from the continuous rain and cases of [[enteric fever]] were taken away every day. Allenby soon established himself as a strict disciplinarian, according to [[A. B.

At the outbreak of war in August 1914, a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to France. It consisted of four infantry divisions and one [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|cavalry division]], the latter commanded by Allenby. The cavalry division first saw action in semi-chaotic circumstances covering the retreat after the [[Battle of Mons]] opposing the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s invasion of France. One of Allenby's subordinates claimed at the time: \"He cannot explain verbally, with any lucidity at all, what his plans are\".<ref name=urban219>Urban, 2005 p. 219</ref> When a headquarters officer asked why [[Hubert Gough]]'s cavalry brigade was miles from where it was supposed to be, he received the reply: \"He told me he was getting as far away from the Bull as possible. It was a most scandalous affair, and he was in an almost open rebellion against Allenby at the time\".<ref name=urban219/><ref group=\"Note\">During the retreat from Mons, Allenby clashed with Gough, his subordinate then commanding [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Cavalry Brigade]]. Gough wrote in 1930 that \"we were kept in such ignorance of the entire situation\" by \"that stupid man Allenby\", and he claimed to have not known the whole story of what had been going on until he read [[Horace Smith-Dorrien|Smith-Dorrien]]'s memoirs. [Farrar-Hockley 1975, p. 352]</ref> The division distinguished itself under Allenby's direction in the subsequent fighting, with minimal resources at its disposal, at the [[First Battle of Ypres]].<ref name=heath21/>\n\nAllenby was promoted to temporary [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]] on 10 October 1914.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28981|date=20 November 1914|page=9540|nolink=y}}</ref> As the BEF was expanded in size to two Armies, he was rewarded by being made commander of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]].<ref name=heath21/> On 6 May 1915, Allenby voluntarily left the Cavalry Arm to take up command of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] which was engaged at that moment in severe fighting at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. Commanding a corps seemed to make Allenby's bad temper even worse where anything from a split infinitive in a staff paper to discovering a corpse in the field without the tin helmet that Allenby ordered his men to wear sent Allenby off into a rage.<ref name=urban219/> The V Corps was victorious in defeating the German assault but incurred controversially heavy losses in the process through Allenby's tactical policy of continual [[counter-attack]]s at the German attacking force. In September 1915, V Corps attempted a diversion of German strength to facilitate the concurrent British [[Battle of Loos|offensive at Loos]]. They executed a minor attack in the Hooge Sector in the Ypres Salient under Allenby's direction, which once again incurred substantial losses to its units involved in the affair.<ref>Gardner, pp. 66\u2013115</ref> In October 1915, Allenby was promoted to lead the [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|British Third Army]],<ref name=heath21/> being made lieutenant-general (substantive rank) on 1 January 1916.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29438 |supp=y|date=11 January 1916|page=568|nolink=y}}</ref> In mid-Summer 1916, he was the Army Commander in support of the launch of the [[Battle of the Somme]] offensive, with responsibility for the abortive assault by 3rd Army troops on the trench fortress of the [[Gommecourt, Pas-de-Calais|Gommecourt]] salient, which failed with severe casualties to the units under his command in the operation. By this time in 1916, [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] who was one of Allenby's staff officers and supporters, wrote that Allenby's temper seemed to \"confirm the legend that 'the Bull' was merely a bad-tempered, obstinate hot-head, a 'thud-and-blunder' general\".<ref name=urban219/> Allenby harboured doubts about the leadership of the commander of the BEF, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]], but refused to allow any of his officers to say anything critical about Haig.<ref>Urban, 2005 p. 220</ref> However, despite Allenby's rages and obsession with applying the rules in a way that often seemed petty, Allenby's staff officers found an intellectually curious general who was interested in finding new ways of breaking the stalemate.<ref name=urban221>Urban, 2005 p. 221</ref> [[J. F. C. Fuller]] called Allenby \"a man I grew to like and respect\", a man who always asked his staff if they had any new ideas about how to win the war.<ref name=urban221/> Allenby had wider interests than many other British generals, reading books on every conceivable subject from botany to poetry and was noted for his critical intellect.<ref name=urban221/> An officer who had dinner with Allenby at his headquarters in a French ch\u00e2teau recalled:\n\n<blockquote>His keen grey-blue eyes, under heavy brows, search the face while he probes the mind with sharp, almost staccato questions about everything under the sun except what is expected.

[[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] and [[Maurice Hankey|Hankey]] recommended that Britain seize ground in the Middle East. Lloyd George wanted more effort on other fronts, but also wanted a commander \"of the dashing type\" to replace Sir [[Archibald Murray]] in command of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]]. Smuts refused the command (late May) unless promised resources for a decisive victory. Lloyd George appointed Allenby to the role.<ref name=heath21/>\n\n==== British change in mindset ====\nWhen Allenby received this assignment, he first believed it was a joke, because he was still on the thought that the war would be decided on the Western Front. Instead, this \"joke\" represented a change in mindset in many British leaders. Previously, leaders were concerned that taking over Palestine would divide it and leave it for other countries to take, but repeated losses to the Turkish Army and the stalled Western Front left many leaders including Lloyd George to believe that taking Palestine was the right decision.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Neiberg|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael S.

Allenby's exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed<!---what does this sentence mean??--->.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp155-9</ref>\n\n==== Palestine Campaign ====\nAllenby  arrived on 27 June 1917. On 31 July 1917 he received a telegram from his wife saying that Michael Allenby had been killed in action, leading to Allenby's break down in tears in public while he recited a poem by [[Rupert Brooke]].<ref name=\"urban228\">Urban, 2005 p. 228</ref> Afterwards, Allenby kept his grief to himself and his wife, and instead threw himself into his work with icy determination, working very long hours without a break.<ref name=\"urban222\" /> Wavell recalled: \"He went on with his work and asked no sympathy. Only those who stood close to him knew how heavy the blow had been, how nearly it had broken him, and what courage it had taken to withstand it\".<ref name=\"urban228\" /> Allenby assessed the Turkish Army's fighting force that he was facing to be 46,000 rifles and 2,800 sabres, and estimated that he could take Jerusalem with 7 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions. He did not feel that there was a sufficient military case to do so, and felt that he would need reinforcements to advance further. Allenby understood the problems posed by logistics in the desert and spent much time working to ensure his soldiers would be well supplied at all times, especially with water.<ref name=\"urban229\">Urban, 2005 p. 229</ref> The logistics of getting water to the soldiers and through the desert is thought to be the biggest challenge and accomplishment Allenby made in the Middle East campaign.<ref name=\":1\">Neiberg, Michael S. the Henry L. Stimson Chair and Professor of History in the Department of National Security and Strategy and WWI and II Author. Personal Interview. 2 February 2016.</ref> Allenby also saw the importance of good medical treatment and insisted that proper medical facilities be created to treat all of the diseases common to the Middle East like [[ophthalmia]] and enteric fever.<ref name=\"urban229\" />  Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but the extent of his advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in \"secret and personal\" notes (1 and 10 August).<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp157-9</ref>\n\nAllenby quickly won the respect of his troops by making frequent visits to the EEF's front-line units, in a marked change from the leadership style of his predecessor Murray, who had commanded primarily from [[Cairo]]. Allenby moved the EEF's [[Headquarters|GHQ]] from the Egyptian capital city to [[Rafah]], nearer to the front lines at [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and re-organized the disparate forces of the EEF into a three primary corps order of battle: [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX]], [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI]], and the [[Desert Mounted Corps]]. He also approved the utilisation of Arabic irregular forces which were operating at that time to the Turkish Army's open left flank in the Arabian interior, under the direction of a young British Army Intelligence officer named [[T. E. Lawrence]]. He sanctioned \u00a3200,000 a month for Lawrence to facilitate his work amongst the tribes involved.<ref>Hughes, chapter 5</ref>\n\nIn early October 1917, Robertson asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza-[[Beersheba]] line (30 miles wide) to the [[Jaffa]]-[[Jerusalem]] line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat. Allenby's estimate was that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig's forces went on the defensive) and that he might face 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions. Yet, in private letters, Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem.<!---the following phrase has been cut because it makes no sense: and in the event the Germans sent only 3 battalions to Palestine, and Turkish strength there was only 21,000 (out of 110,000 on all fronts) facing 100,000 British Empire troops.---><ref>Woodward, 1998, pp159-162</ref>\n\nHaving reorganised his regular forces, Allenby won the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] (31 October \u2013 7 November 1917) by surprising the defenders with an [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|attack at Beersheba.]]<ref name=\"heath22\" /> The first step in capturing Beersheba was to send out false radio messages prompting the Turkish forces to think Britain was going to attack Gaza. After that, one brave intelligence officer, Colonel [[Richard Meinertzhagen]], rode right up to the Turkish line, barely evading capture. In the fray, he dropped a bloodstained bag, smeared with horse blood, with fake military plans in it. The plans falsely described how the British force was on its way to capture Gaza. Additional radio messages threatening Meinertzhagen made up the Turkish Army's mind: the British Army was going to attack Gaza.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Military Commanders: The 100 Greatest Throughout History|last=Cawthorne|first=Nigel|publisher=Enchanted Lion|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=150\u2013151}}</ref> Instead, they went through with the capture of Beersheba. \u201cThe Turks at Beersheba were undoubtedly taken completely by surprise, a surprise from which the dash of London troops and Yeomanry, finely supported by their artillery, never gave them time to recover.

By early 1918, 50,000 Turks in the theatre were tying down a [[British Empire]] ration strength of over 400,000 (of whom almost half were non-combatants, and 117,471 were British troops).<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp164, 167</ref>\n\nSmuts was sent to Egypt to confer with Allenby and [[William Raine Marshall|Marshall]], with Robertson's clash with the government now moving to its final stages, and the new [[Supreme War Council]] at Versailles drawing up plans for more efforts in the Middle East. Allenby told Smuts of Robertson's private instructions (sent by hand of [[Walter Kirke]], appointed by Robertson as Smuts' adviser) that there was no merit in any further advance. Allenby worked with Smuts to draw up plans to reach [[Haifa]] by June and Damascus by the autumn, reinforced by 3 divisions from [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]]. The speed of the advance was limited by the need to lay fresh rail track. This met with War Cabinet approval (6 March 1918).<ref name=\"Woodward, 1998, pp165-8\">Woodward, 1998, pp165-8</ref>\n\nThe German [[Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front meant that Allenby was without reinforcements after his forces failed to capture [[Amman]] in March and April 1918. He halted the offensive in the spring of 1918 and had to send 60,000 men to the Western Front, although the Dominion Prime Ministers in the [[Imperial War Cabinet]] continued to demand a strong commitment to the Middle East in case Germany could not be beaten.<ref name=\"Woodward, 1998, pp165-8\"/>\n\nNew troops from the British Empire (specifically Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[India]], and South Africa) led to the resumption of operations in August 1918. Following an extended series of deceptive moves, the Ottoman line was broken at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] (19\u201321 September 1918), and the Allied cavalry passed through and blocked the Turkish retreat. The EEF then advanced at an impressive rate, as high as 60 miles in 55 hours for cavalry, and infantry slogging 20 miles a day and encountering minimal resistance. Damascus fell on 1 October, [[Homs]] on 16 October, and [[Aleppo]] on 25 October. With the threat of Asia Minor being invaded, the Ottoman Empire capitulated on 30 October 1918 with the signing of the [[Armistice of Mudros]].<ref name=heath22/>\n\n==Governor of Egypt==\n[[File:Ed-Allenby.jpg|thumb|left|Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby (1861\u20131936), British Field Marshal by [[Henry Walter Barnett]]]]\nAllenby was made a [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 31 July 1919,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31484 |supp=y|date=31 July 1919|page=9835|nolink=y}}</ref> and created '''Viscount Allenby''' of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]] and of [[Felixstowe]] in the [[Suffolk|County of Suffolk]] on 7 October.<ref name=heath23>Heathcote, p. 23</ref>\n\nHis appointment in 1919 as Special High Commissioner of Egypt came as the country was being disrupted by [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|demonstrations against British rule]]. It had been under [[Martial Law]] since 1914 and several of Egyptian leaders, including [[Saad Zaghlul]], had been exiled to Malta.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, volume 8, 1930. pp 96,97</ref>\n\nThese deportations had led to rioting across the country, with Cairo isolated. Allenby's first response was conciliatory. He persuaded the Colonial Office to allow Zaghlul and his delegation, [[wafd]], to travel to France. Their intention was to present the Egyptian case to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] but they received no official recognition and returned to Egypt in failure.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, volume 8, 1930. p 97</ref>\n\nIn early 1921 there were more riots and demonstrations that were blamed on Zaghlul. This time Allenby ordered that Zaghlul and five other leaders be deported to the Seychelles. Sixteen rioters were executed. The following year Allenby travelled to London with proposals which he insisted be implemented. They included the end of Martial Law, the drafting of an Egyptian Constitution and the return of Zaglul. Progress was made: Egypt was granted [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|limited self-government]], and a [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|draft constitution]] was published in October 1922 leading to the formation of a Zaghlul government in January 1924. The following November the commander of British forces in Egypt and Sudan, [[Lee Stack]], was assassinated in Cairo. Allenby's response was draconian and included a humiliating \u00a3500,000 fine to be paid by the Egyptian Government. In May 1925, Allenby resigned and returned to England.<ref>Encyclopaedia Britanica, volume 8, 1930. pp 97-99</ref><ref name=heath23/>\n\n==Retirement==\nAllenby was appointed Honorary Colonel of the [[Cinque Ports Fortress Royal Engineers]] on 12 September 1925<ref>''Army Lists''.</ref> and made [[Captain of Deal Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastkent.freeuk.com/deal/castle/captains.htm|title=Captains of Deal Castle|publisher=East Kent freeuk|accessdate= 10 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nMurray and Allenby were invited to give lectures at Aldershot in 1931 about the Palestine Campaign. Exchanging letters beforehand, Murray asked whether it had been worth risking the Western Front (in the autumn of 1917) to transfer troops to Palestine. Allenby avoided that question, but commented that in 1917 and into the spring of 1918 it had been far from clear that the Allies were going to win the war. Russia was dropping out, but the Americans were not yet present in strength. France and Italy were weakened and might have been persuaded to make peace, perhaps by Germany giving up Belgium or Alsace-Lorraine, or Austria-Hungary giving up the Trentino. In those circumstances, Germany was likely to be left in control of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, and it had been sensible for Britain to grab some land in the Middle East to block Germany's route to India. Allenby's views mirrored those of the War Cabinet at the time.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp212</ref>\n\nAllenby went to [[Patagonia]] for a last fishing trip, aged 74, to see if the salmon really were as big as those in the Tay.<ref>Reid 2006, p67</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHe died suddenly from a ruptured [[cerebral aneurysm]] on 14 May 1936 at his house in Kensington, London at the age of 75 years.

Lawrence (''\"Lawrence of Arabia\"'') were greatly aided by Allenby in the Arab Revolt, and he thought highly of Allenby: \"(He was) physically large and confident, and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby|publisher=Mediashift|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nInto the 1990s, residents of [[Isma\u00eflia]] in north-eastern [[Egypt]] burned effigies to mark an annual spring holiday, including one of Allenby more than 70 years after he led forces in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]].<ref>{{cite news | first = Ashraf | last = Khalil | title = Revolt of Egypt\u2019s Canal Cities: An Ill Omen for Morsi | date = 2013-01-29 | url = http://world.time.com/2013/01/29/revolt-of-the-egypts-canal-cities-an-ill-omen-for-morsi/ | work = Time | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}</ref>\n\nThe British journalist [[Mark Urban]] has argued that Allenby is one of the most important British generals who ever lived, writing that Allenby's use of air power, mechanised forces and irregulars led by Lawrence marked one of the first attempts at a new type of war while at the same time he had to act as a politician holding together a force comprising men from many nations, making him \"the first of the modern supreme commanders\".<ref>Urban, 2005 p. 238</ref> Urban further argued during the war, the British government had made all sorts of plans for the Middle East such as the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] in 1916 and the [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917, but as long as the Ottoman Empire continued to hold much of the Near East, these plans meant nothing.<ref name=urban239>Urban, 2005 p. 239</ref> By defeating the Ottomans in 1917\u201318, Allenby, if he did not create the modern Middle East, at the very least made the creation of the modern Middle East possible.<ref name=urban239/> If the Ottoman Empire had continued in its pre-war frontiers after the war \u2014 and before Allenby arrived in Egypt the British had not advanced very far \u2014 then it is probable that the nations of Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq would not exist today.<ref name=urban239/>\n\n==Honours==\n<center>\nRibbon bar (as it would look today):\n\n[[File:Order of the Bath UK ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:UK Order St-Michael St-George ribbon.svg|100px]]\n[[File:Royal Victorian Order ribbon sm.jpg|100px]]\n[[File:VOStJ ribbon.png|100px]]\n\n[[File:Queens South Africa Medal 1899-1902 ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:King's South Africa Medal.png|100px]]\n[[File:Ribbon - 1914 Star & Rosette.png|100px]]\n[[File:British War Medal BAR.svg|100px]]\n\n[[File:Victory Medal MID ribbon bar.svg|100px]]\n[[File:King George V Coronation Medal ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:GeorgeVSilverJubileum-ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:Legion Honneur GO ribbon.svg|100px]]\n\n[[File:BEL Croix de Guerre WW1 ribbon.svg|100px]]\n[[File:SRB Orden Belog Orla BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:GRE Order Redeemer 1Class.png|100px]]\n[[File:Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 ribbon.svg|100px]]\n\n[[File:U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal ribbon.svg|100px]]\n[[File:Grande ufficiale OMS BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:Romanian kruunuritarikunnan suurristi.png|100px]]\n[[File:Order of the Osmanie lenta.png|100px]]\n\n[[File:Jordan004.gif|100px]]\n[[File:Order of Michael the Brave ribbon.svg|100px]]\n[[File:JPN Kyokujitsu-sho 1Class BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:JPN Kyokujitsu-sho Paulownia BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:Grand Crest Ordre de Leopold.png|100px]]\n\n</center>\n\n===British===\n*Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]], Military Division (GCB) \u2013 5 November 1918<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30992|date=5 November 1918|page=13000|nolink=y}}</ref> (KCB: 18 February 1915;<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29086|date=2 March 1915|page=2090|nolink=y}}</ref> CB: 26 June 1902<ref name=LG27448 />)\n*Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of St. Michael and St. George]] (GCMG) \u2013 17 December 1917<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30435|date=18 December 1917|page=13243|nolink=y}}</ref>\n*[[Viscount Allenby]] of Meggido and of Felixstowe in the County of Suffolk \u2013 18 October 1919<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31610|date=21 October 1919|page=12890|nolink=y}}</ref>\n*Knight of Justice of the [[Venerable Order of St. John]] (KJStJ) \u2013 19 June 1925<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33059|date=23 June 1925|page=4193|nolink=y}}</ref> (Knight of Grace: 21 December 1917<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13185|date=1 January 1918|page=1|city=e |nolink=y}}</ref>)\n*Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] (GCVO) \u2013 4 June 1934<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34056|date=4 June 1934|page=3561|nolink=y}}</ref>\n\n====Campaign and commemorative medals====\n*[[Queen's South Africa Medal]]<ref name=Harts>{{Cite book|author=Hart's|title=Annual Army List, 1904.|page=174.
