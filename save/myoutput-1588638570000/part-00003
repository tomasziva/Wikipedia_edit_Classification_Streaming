He has also managed [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. As he did with Blackpool three years earlier, Holloway managed Crystal Palace to promotion to the [[Premier League]] in May 2013, but after the club had won only one of their opening eight games he left, by mutual consent, on 23 October 2013 after less than a year in charge. On 6 January 2014 Holloway signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]; this was terminated in March 2015. He rejoined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] as manager on 11 November 2016.\n\nHe is known by the nickname \"Ollie\", which is also the title of his [[autobiography]]. Holloway has a reputation amongst football fans for his West Country accent, off-the-wall interviews and amusing answers to questions from the media,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22707916 |title=The comic wisdom of Crystal Palace boss Ian Holloway  |agency=BBC|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> with a wide selection of quotes and soundbites being printed.\n\n==Playing career==\n\nA native of [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire]], east of [[Bristol]], Holloway grew up in [[Cadbury Heath]], where his mother, Jean, lived in the same council house until her death in April 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | title = 'Not in a million years,' Holloway refutes claims he's set to leave QPR | last = Spencer | first = Phil | work = football.london | date = 22 March 2018 | accessdate = 12 June 2018 | url = https://www.football.london/queens-park-rangers-fc/ian-holloway-qpr-leeds-future-14622871 }}</ref> Holloway went to [[Sir Bernard Lovell School]] in [[Oldland Common]] at the same time that [[Gary Penrice]] was at Chase School for Boys in Mangotsfield.  They still remain close friends today.

He usually played on the right side of midfield, and made his name as one of the more promising players in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] (now [[Football League One|League One]]). After four seasons at Rovers, he was transferred to [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in July 1985 for \u00a335,000.\n\nHolloway's stay at Wimbledon was a short one. In March 1986, after less than one year at the club, he was sold to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] for \u00a325,000, where he also spent just a little over a year. In January 1987 he joined [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on loan, playing five times. In August 1987, after two years in [[London]], Holloway returned to Bristol Rovers for a fee of \u00a310,000.\n\nBack at Rovers, who were now playing \"home\" games at [[Twerton Park]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and under the wing of new Rovers manager [[Gerry Francis]], Holloway flourished. In four seasons, he missed only five games. When Francis was appointed manager of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in 1991, one of his first signings was Holloway, for a fee of \u00a3230,000 in August 1991. Holloway spent five seasons at QPR, playing more than 150 games for the club, before returning to Bristol Rovers for the third time in August 1996, this time as player-manager.<ref name=\"Ian Holloway Playing Statistics\">{{cite web|title=Ian Holloway-Soccerbase|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=3573|website=Soccoerbase.com|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Bristol Rovers===\nHolloway took over a club that was struggling both on and off the pitch. In his first season in charge of Rovers, he led the club to 17th place in Division Two (now League One). The next season, however, Bristol Rovers gained fifth place and made the [[Football League play-offs|playoffs]]. Despite taking a first-leg advantage of 3\u20131 against Northampton Town, Rovers subsequently lost 3\u20130 in the second leg and went out 4\u20133 on aggregate in the semi-finals. The 1998\u201399 season ended with a somewhat disappointing 13th place. Holloway retired as a player following that season, having played more than 400 matches for Bristol Rovers, to concentrate fully on management. In 1999\u20132000, his last full season at the club, Rovers finished 7th, narrowly missing the playoffs.\n\n===Queens Park Rangers===\nIn February 2001, midway through the 2000\u201301 season, Holloway was appointed manager of QPR, where he was given the task of keeping the team in Division One. He failed to do so, as QPR finished second from bottom and were relegated to the third level for the first time in 34 years. Despite the relegation, Holloway stayed on and rebuilt the side. After steadying the ship in 2001\u201302, and a near miss in 2002\u201303, Holloway and QPR were promoted back to the second level in 2004, finishing second behind [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].\n\nHolloway's first full season in [[Football League Championship|The Championship]] ended with a respectable 11th place, and during the following season 2005\u201306, the club continued to hover around mid-table.\n\nHolloway was suspended (sent on gardening leave) as manager by Queens Park Rangers on 6 February 2006. The reason given by the QPR board was that the constant rumours linking Holloway to the vacant managerial position at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] were causing too many problems for the club.<ref name=\"QPR suspend Holloway\">{{Cite news| title=QPR suspend Holloway| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/4685138.stm| publisher= [[bbc.co.uk]]| date=6 February 2006| accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> As it turned out, the Leicester job went to [[Rob Kelly]], and QPR went on to finish 21st, just one place above the relegation positions.\n\n===Plymouth Argyle===\n[[File:Holloway.jpg|thumb|upright|Holloway in 2007]]\nOn 28 June 2006, Holloway became the manager of [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], and promised to take the club to the [[Premier League]].<ref name=\"Holloway has top-flight dream\">{{Cite news| title=Holloway has top-flight dream| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/4781671.stm| publisher= [[bbc.co.uk]]| date=11 August 2006| accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> On 12 August, after Plymouth beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] away 2\u20133, in celebration of his first away win as manager, Holloway offered to buy every one of the 700 fans who made the {{convert|805|mi|km|adj=on}} round trip a drink: ''\"Anyone who travelled up there please send me a letter.

Talking about his children, Holloway said: \"it's been a fight all the way along to get proper provision for the girls, especially a good education. There's been rows, tribunals, appeals and endless phone calls. We have been labelled as bolshie parents. My view is that every child in the world has the right to be educated properly and whether your eyes or ears don't work is irrelevant.

They still remain close friends today.

He usually played on the right side of midfield, and made his name as one of the more promising players in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] (now [[Football League One|League One]]). After four seasons at Rovers, he was transferred to [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in July 1985 for \u00a335,000.\n\nHolloway's stay at Wimbledon was a short one. In March 1986, after less than one year at the club, he was sold to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] for \u00a325,000, where he also spent just a little over a year. In January 1987 he joined [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on loan, playing five times. In August 1987, after two years in [[London]], Holloway returned to Bristol Rovers for a fee of \u00a310,000.\n\nBack at Rovers, who were now playing \"home\" games at [[Twerton Park]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and under the wing of new Rovers manager [[Gerry Francis]], Holloway flourished. In four seasons, he missed only five games. When Francis was appointed manager of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in 1991, one of his first signings was Holloway, for a fee of \u00a3230,000 in August 1991. Holloway spent five seasons at QPR, playing more than 150 games for the club, before returning to Bristol Rovers for the third time in August 1996, this time as player-manager.<ref name=\"Ian Holloway Playing Statistics\">{{cite web|title=Ian Holloway-Soccerbase|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=3573|website=Soccoerbase.com|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Bristol Rovers===\nHolloway took over a club that was struggling both on and off the pitch. In his first season in charge of Rovers, he led the club to 17th place in Division Two (now League One). The next season, however, Bristol Rovers gained fifth place and made the [[Football League play-offs|playoffs]]. Despite taking a first-leg advantage of 3\u20131 against Northampton Town, Rovers subsequently lost 3\u20130 in the second leg and went out 4\u20133 on aggregate in the semi-finals. The 1998\u201399 season ended with a somewhat disappointing 13th place. Holloway retired as a player following that season, having played more than 400 matches for Bristol Rovers, to concentrate fully on management. In 1999\u20132000, his last full season at the club, Rovers finished 7th, narrowly missing the playoffs.\n\n===Queens Park Rangers===\nIn February 2001, midway through the 2000\u201301 season, Holloway was appointed manager of QPR, where he was given the task of keeping the team in Division One. He failed to do so, as QPR finished second from bottom and were relegated to the third level for the first time in 34 years. Despite the relegation, Holloway stayed on and rebuilt the side. After steadying the ship in 2001\u201302, and a near miss in 2002\u201303, Holloway and QPR were promoted back to the second level in 2004, finishing second behind [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].\n\nHolloway's first full season in [[Football League Championship|The Championship]] ended with a respectable 11th place, and during the following season 2005\u201306, the club continued to hover around mid-table.\n\nHolloway was suspended (sent on gardening leave) as manager by Queens Park Rangers on 6 February 2006. The reason given by the QPR board was that the constant rumours linking Holloway to the vacant managerial position at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] were causing too many problems for the club.<ref name=\"QPR suspend Holloway\">{{Cite news| title=QPR suspend Holloway| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/4685138.stm| publisher= [[bbc.co.uk]]| date=6 February 2006| accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> As it turned out, the Leicester job went to [[Rob Kelly]], and QPR went on to finish 21st, just one place above the relegation positions.\n\n===Plymouth Argyle===\n[[File:Holloway.jpg|thumb|upright|Holloway in 2007]]\nOn 28 June 2006, Holloway became the manager of [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], and promised to take the club to the [[Premier League]].<ref name=\"Holloway has top-flight dream\">{{Cite news| title=Holloway has top-flight dream| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/4781671.stm| publisher= [[bbc.co.uk]]| date=11 August 2006| accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> On 12 August, after Plymouth beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] away 2\u20133, in celebration of his first away win as manager, Holloway offered to buy every one of the 700 fans who made the {{convert|805|mi|km|adj=on}} round trip a drink: ''\"Anyone who travelled up there please send me a letter.

As a result, he developed severe [[sciatica]].<ref name=\"ind2200467\"/> They then moved to St Albans when the children were of secondary school age, for the same reason.
