From there, the highway travels east-northeastward through [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] before turning eastward towards [[Dallas/Fort Worth]]. The [[La Entrada al Pacifico]] corridor runs along I-20 between [[U.S. Route 385]] (US&nbsp;385) and [[Farm to Market Road 1788]] (FM 1788). Between [[Monahans, Texas|Monahans]] and I-10, I-20 has an {{convert|80|mph|km/h}} speed limit.\n\nFrom the highway's opening in the 1960s through 1971, I-20 originally went through the heart of the Metroplex via the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike]]. This old route is now signed [[Interstate 30|I-30]] (Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike), [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]] (former stretch between I-635 and [[Terrell, Texas|Terrell]]) and [[Texas State Highway Spur 557|Texas Spur&nbsp;557]] (bypass around Terrell).\n\nIn 1977, I-20 was rerouted to go through the southern sections of Fort Worth, [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], [[Dallas]], and [[Mesquite, Texas|Mesquite]] before rejoining its original route at Terrell. Part of I-20 in Dallas is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway and used to be signed as I-635.\n\nI-20 continues eastward from Terrell, bypassing [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], and [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]] before crossing the Louisiana border near Waskom.\n\n===Louisiana===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Louisiana}}\n\nIn [[Louisiana]], I-20 roughly parallels [[U.S. Route 80 in Louisiana|U.S. Route 80]] through the northern part of the state.\n\nEntering the state from near [[Waskom, Texas]], the highway immediately enters the [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]-[[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] metropolitan area, intersecting [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]] near downtown Shreveport and passing close to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in Bossier City.\n\nFrom that area, the highway traverses mainly rural, hilly terrain, bypassing [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] and [[Grambling, Louisiana|Grambling]] before reaching [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]].\n\nFrom Monroe, I-20 enters flatter terrain as it approaches the [[Mississippi River]]. Before crossing the Mississippi, the highway passes [[Tallulah, Louisiana|Tallulah]]. At the Mississippi River, I-20 leaves Louisiana and enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].\n\n===Mississippi===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Mississippi}}\n[[File:Welcometomississippi i-20.jpg|right|thumb|A photo of the state welcome sign westbound.]]\nUpon entering Mississippi by crossing the [[Mississippi River]], I-20 immediately enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. Between Edwards and [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]], the highway mostly follows the original two-lane routing of [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]]. In Jackson, I-20 sees a short concurrency with both [[Interstate 55|I-55]] and [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]]. Also in Jackson is an unusually expansive [[stack interchange]], at the [[Interchange (road)|junction]] of I-20, I-55 North and US&nbsp;49 South. The interchange replaces a former directional interchange at I-55 North and a cloverleaf at Highway&nbsp;49. From the Stack, I-20 continues eastward to [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], where it begins the nearly {{convert|160|mi|km|sing=on}} overlap with [[Interstate 59|I-59]].\n\nThe route of the Mississippi section of I-20 is defined in Mississippi Code \u00a7 65-3-3.\n\n===Alabama===\n[[File:I20I59Birmingham.JPG|left|thumb|I-20 (co-signed with I-59) approaching I-65 in downtown Birmingham. This is sometimes referred to as Malfunction Junction.]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Alabama}}\n\nI-20 (along with I-59) crosses the Alabama state line near York, and it stays conjoined as it passes through western Alabama and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. At [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], the two highways pass through downtown together before splitting at Exit&nbsp;130 just east of the [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham airport]]. I-20 continues eastward through [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]/[[Anniston, Alabama]], and the Talladega National Forest, passing by the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in the process, which is visible from the highway.\n\nAlso in Birmingham, the intersection of I-20&nbsp;/&nbsp;I-59 and [[Interstate 65|I-65]] is known as a [[Malfunction Junction (disambiguation)|Malfunction Junction]] because of the interchange's somewhat-confusing design, and the number of traffic accidents that occur there. This section of the Interstate is currently (2018) undergoing construction to reconfigure the interchanges.<ref>https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/11/birmingham_malfunction_junctio.html</ref><ref>https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/04/dysfunction_at_malfunction_jun.html</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\n[[File:Augusta Georgia I-20 at I-520 flyover ramp construction.jpg|thumb|I-20 eastbound at I-520 interchange, in Augusta, GA]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Georgia}}\n\nI-20 enters Georgia near [[Tallapoosa, Georgia|Tallapoosa]] and after passing through western Georgia, it enters the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]. On clear days, eastbound motorists get their first view of [[downtown Atlanta]] as they come over the top of the [[Six Flags Hill]]. The [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] amusement park is easily visible off exit&nbsp;46 eastbound. The highway then passes through the center of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], meeting with [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]], which share a common expressway (the \"[[Downtown Connector]]\"). It continues through Metropolitan Atlanta eastward and through the eastern half of Georgia until it exits the state, crossing the [[Savannah River]] at [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].\n\nThroughout the state, I-20 is conjoined with unsigned [[Georgia State Route 402|State Route&nbsp;402]] (SR&nbsp;402). Also, I-20 from the Alabama state line to [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|I-285]] in Atlanta is named the \"Tom Murphy Freeway\", but it is called the \"Ralph David Abernathy Freeway\" within I-285. The Interstate Highway is also named the Purple Heart Highway from I-285 in DeKalb County to [[U.S. 441|US&nbsp;441]] in [[Madison, Georgia]], and it is called the Carl Sanders Highway from US&nbsp;441 to the South Carolina state line.\n\n===South Carolina===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in South Carolina}}\n[[File:Northbound Interstate 95 @ Interstate 20; Florence SC.jpg|right|thumb|Approaching the eastern terminus of I-20 on I-95, Florence, SC]]\n\nUpon leaving Augusta, I-20 crosses the [[Savannah River]] and enters the Palmetto State and heads northeastward, bypassing [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]] and [[Lexington, South Carolina|Lexington]] before reaching the state capital of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], which can be reached most directly by taking [[Interstate 26|I-26]] east at Exit&nbsp;64 (\"Malfunction Junction\"), then, almost immediately, [[Interstate 126|I-126]]&nbsp;/&nbsp;[[U.S. Route 76|US&nbsp;76]].\n\nAt Columbia, I-20 bypasses the city to the north and again turns northeastward, bypassing [[Fort Jackson, South Carolina|Fort Jackson]] and [[Camden, South Carolina|Camden]]. After crossing the [[Wateree River]], it turns due east, passes by tiny [[Bishopville]], before reaching the [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] area. It is near Florence where I-20 sees its eastern terminus at [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]]. However, for about two miles (3&nbsp;km), the highway continues into Florence as [[Interstate 20 Business (Florence, South Carolina)|Business Spur&nbsp;20]].\n\nI-20 in the Palmetto State is known as either the J. Strom Thurmond Freeway or John C. West Freeway. The first section to be completed was the [[bridge]] over the Savannah River in 1965; the last, the section between [[U.S. Route 401|US&nbsp;401]] and I-95 (including the business spur), opened in August 1975.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}\nI-20 was built in 1957 connecting Texas to the east coast running through Shreveport La, Ruston La, and Monroe La making it their first interstate.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nI-20's path in Atlanta was designed in the late 1950s, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], to separate the city's white and African-American populations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/traffic-atlanta-segregation.html|title=What does a traffic jam in Atlanta have to do with segregation?

Instead, South Carolina is concentrating their efforts on plans to build [[Interstate 73|I-73]] that will terminate near Myrtle Beach. This proposed extension has not been approved by the Federal Highway Administration or the AASHTO, so any construction remains far in the future, but NCDOT maintains the routing in its Strategic Highway Corridors maps.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=NCDOT|url=http://www.ncdot.org/doh/PRECONSTRUCT/tpb/shc/PDF/SHC_Vision_Plan_Southeastern_NC.pdf|title=Strategic Highway Corridors Vision Plan, Southeastern NC|date=2004-09-02|work=Strategic Highway Corridors|accessdate=2009-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==Junction list==\n;Texas\n: {{jct|country=USA|I|10}} at [[Scroggins Draw, Texas| Scroggins Draw]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|285}} in [[Pecos, Texas|Pecos]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|385}} in [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|87}} in [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|84}} east of [[Roscoe, Texas|Roscoe]].

From there, the highway travels east-northeastward through [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] before turning eastward towards [[Dallas/Fort Worth]]. The [[La Entrada al Pacifico]] corridor runs along I-20 between [[U.S. Route 385]] (US&nbsp;385) and [[Farm to Market Road 1788]] (FM 1788). Between [[Monahans, Texas|Monahans]] and I-10, I-20 has an {{convert|80|mph|km/h}} speed limit.\n\nFrom the highway's opening in the 1960s through 1971, I-20 originally went through the heart of the Metroplex via the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike]]. This old route is now signed [[Interstate 30|I-30]] (Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike), [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]] (former stretch between I-635 and [[Terrell, Texas|Terrell]]) and [[Texas State Highway Spur 557|Texas Spur&nbsp;557]] (bypass around Terrell).\n\nIn 1977, I-20 was rerouted to go through the southern sections of Fort Worth, [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], [[Dallas]], and [[Mesquite, Texas|Mesquite]] before rejoining its original route at Terrell. Part of I-20 in Dallas is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway and used to be signed as I-635.\n\nI-20 continues eastward from Terrell, bypassing [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], and [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]] before crossing the Louisiana border near Waskom.\n\n===Louisiana===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Louisiana}}\n\nIn [[Louisiana]], I-20 roughly parallels [[U.S. Route 80 in Louisiana|U.S. Route 80]] through the northern part of the state.\n\nEntering the state from near [[Waskom, Texas]], the highway immediately enters the [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]-[[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] metropolitan area, intersecting [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]] near downtown Shreveport and passing close to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in Bossier City.\n\nFrom that area, the highway traverses mainly rural, hilly terrain, bypassing [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] and [[Grambling, Louisiana|Grambling]] before reaching [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]].\n\nFrom Monroe, I-20 enters flatter terrain as it approaches the [[Mississippi River]]. Before crossing the Mississippi, the highway passes [[Tallulah, Louisiana|Tallulah]]. At the Mississippi River, I-20 leaves Louisiana and enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].\n\n===Mississippi===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Mississippi}}\n[[File:Welcometomississippi i-20.jpg|right|thumb|A photo of the state welcome sign westbound.]]\nUpon entering Mississippi by crossing the [[Mississippi River]], I-20 immediately enters [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. Between Edwards and [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]], the highway mostly follows the original two-lane routing of [[U.S. Route 80|US&nbsp;80]]. In Jackson, I-20 sees a short concurrency with both [[Interstate 55|I-55]] and [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]]. Also in Jackson is an unusually expansive [[stack interchange]], at the [[Interchange (road)|junction]] of I-20, I-55 North and US&nbsp;49 South. The interchange replaces a former directional interchange at I-55 North and a cloverleaf at Highway&nbsp;49. From the Stack, I-20 continues eastward to [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], where it begins the nearly {{convert|160|mi|km|sing=on}} overlap with [[Interstate 59|I-59]].\n\nThe route of the Mississippi section of I-20 is defined in Mississippi Code \u00a7 65-3-3.\n\n===Alabama===\n[[File:I20I59Birmingham.JPG|left|thumb|I-20 (co-signed with I-59) approaching I-65 in downtown Birmingham. This is sometimes referred to as Malfunction Junction.]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Alabama}}\n\nI-20 (along with I-59) crosses the Alabama state line near York, and it stays conjoined as it passes through western Alabama and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. At [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], the two highways pass through downtown together before splitting at Exit&nbsp;130 just east of the [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham airport]]. I-20 continues eastward through [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]/[[Anniston, Alabama]], and the Talladega National Forest, passing by the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in the process, which is visible from the highway.\n\nAlso in Birmingham, the intersection of I-20&nbsp;/&nbsp;I-59 and [[Interstate 65|I-65]] is known as a [[Malfunction Junction]]{{dn|date=May 2020}} because of the interchange's somewhat-confusing design, and the number of traffic accidents that occur there. This section of the Interstate is currently (2018) undergoing construction to reconfigure the interchanges.<ref>https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/11/birmingham_malfunction_junctio.html</ref><ref>https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/04/dysfunction_at_malfunction_jun.html</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\n[[File:Augusta Georgia I-20 at I-520 flyover ramp construction.jpg|thumb|I-20 eastbound at I-520 interchange, in Augusta, GA]]\n{{main|Interstate 20 in Georgia}}\n\nI-20 enters Georgia near [[Tallapoosa, Georgia|Tallapoosa]] and after passing through western Georgia, it enters the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]. On clear days, eastbound motorists get their first view of [[downtown Atlanta]] as they come over the top of the [[Six Flags Hill]]. The [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] amusement park is easily visible off exit&nbsp;46 eastbound. The highway then passes through the center of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], meeting with [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]], which share a common expressway (the \"[[Downtown Connector]]\"). It continues through Metropolitan Atlanta eastward and through the eastern half of Georgia until it exits the state, crossing the [[Savannah River]] at [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].\n\nThroughout the state, I-20 is conjoined with unsigned [[Georgia State Route 402|State Route&nbsp;402]] (SR&nbsp;402). Also, I-20 from the Alabama state line to [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|I-285]] in Atlanta is named the \"Tom Murphy Freeway\", but it is called the \"Ralph David Abernathy Freeway\" within I-285. The Interstate Highway is also named the Purple Heart Highway from I-285 in DeKalb County to [[U.S. 441|US&nbsp;441]] in [[Madison, Georgia]], and it is called the Carl Sanders Highway from US&nbsp;441 to the South Carolina state line.\n\n===South Carolina===\n{{main|Interstate 20 in South Carolina}}\n[[File:Northbound Interstate 95 @ Interstate 20; Florence SC.jpg|right|thumb|Approaching the eastern terminus of I-20 on I-95, Florence, SC]]\n\nUpon leaving Augusta, I-20 crosses the [[Savannah River]] and enters the Palmetto State and heads northeastward, bypassing [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]] and [[Lexington, South Carolina|Lexington]] before reaching the state capital of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], which can be reached most directly by taking [[Interstate 26|I-26]] east at Exit&nbsp;64 (\"Malfunction Junction\"), then, almost immediately, [[Interstate 126|I-126]]&nbsp;/&nbsp;[[U.S. Route 76|US&nbsp;76]].\n\nAt Columbia, I-20 bypasses the city to the north and again turns northeastward, bypassing [[Fort Jackson, South Carolina|Fort Jackson]] and [[Camden, South Carolina|Camden]]. After crossing the [[Wateree River]], it turns due east, passes by tiny [[Bishopville]], before reaching the [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] area. It is near Florence where I-20 sees its eastern terminus at [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]]. However, for about two miles (3&nbsp;km), the highway continues into Florence as [[Interstate 20 Business (Florence, South Carolina)|Business Spur&nbsp;20]].\n\nI-20 in the Palmetto State is known as either the J. Strom Thurmond Freeway or John C. West Freeway. The first section to be completed was the [[bridge]] over the Savannah River in 1965; the last, the section between [[U.S. Route 401|US&nbsp;401]] and I-95 (including the business spur), opened in August 1975.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}\nI-20 was built in 1957 connecting Texas to the east coast running through Shreveport La, Ruston La, and Monroe La making it their first interstate.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nI-20's path in Atlanta was designed in the late 1950s, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], to separate the city's white and African-American populations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/traffic-atlanta-segregation.html|title=What does a traffic jam in Atlanta have to do with segregation?

Instead, South Carolina is concentrating their efforts on plans to build [[Interstate 73|I-73]] that will terminate near Myrtle Beach. This proposed extension has not been approved by the Federal Highway Administration or the AASHTO, so any construction remains far in the future, but NCDOT maintains the routing in its Strategic Highway Corridors maps.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=NCDOT|url=http://www.ncdot.org/doh/PRECONSTRUCT/tpb/shc/PDF/SHC_Vision_Plan_Southeastern_NC.pdf|title=Strategic Highway Corridors Vision Plan, Southeastern NC|date=2004-09-02|work=Strategic Highway Corridors|accessdate=2009-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==Junction list==\n;Texas\n: {{jct|country=USA|I|10}} at [[Scroggins Draw, Texas| Scroggins Draw]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|285}} in [[Pecos, Texas|Pecos]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|385}} in [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|87}} in [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|US|84}} east of [[Roscoe, Texas|Roscoe]].
