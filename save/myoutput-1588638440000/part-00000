The earliest known letter sent from Malta during the [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|rule of the Order of St John]] is dated 1532. The first formal postal service on the islands was established by the Order in 1708, with the post office being located at the [[Casa del Commun Tesoro]] in [[Valletta]]. The first postal markings on mail appeared later on in the 18th century.\n\nThe postal service was reformed in 1798 during the [[French occupation of Malta]], and the islands were taken over by the British in 1800. In the early 19th century, two separate post offices were established in Malta: the Island Post Office and the Packet Office, with the latter forming part of the [[General Post Office|British Post Office]]. Their operations were amalgamated in 1849, and [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|British postage stamps]] began to be used in Malta in August 1857. Malta's first [[postage stamp]] \u2013 the [[Halfpenny Yellow]] \u2013 was issued in 1860 for use on local mail, while letters sent to foreign destinations continued to be franked with British stamps.\n\nIn 1885, the Malta Post Office was set up and Halfpenny Yellows and British stamps were no longer valid in Malta. A set of six [[definitive stamp]]s along with several types of [[postal stationery]] were issued. Malta continued to issue stamps and stationery throughout the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. At some points from the 1880s to the 1980s, postage stamps were also valid for fiscal use, but at times separate [[Revenue stamps of Malta|revenue stamps]] were issued. [[Postage due]] stamps were issued between 1925 and the 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, the private limited company Posta Limited was set up to run the postal service. The public limited company [[MaltaPost]] took over in 1998, and was gradually privatized between 2002 and 2008.\n\n==Postal history==\n===Hospitaller rule (1530\u20131798)===\n[[File:Casino Maltese - Knights Treasury - Valletta Malta.jpeg|thumb|The [[Casa del Commun Tesoro]] in [[Valletta]], which housed the first post office in Malta between 1708 and 1849]]\n\nThe earliest known information about mail in Malta is from when the islands were under [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Hospitaller rule]].

A \u00bcd value depicting a view of the [[Grand Harbour]] was added in 1901 for the postal rate of local [[printed matter]]. In 1902, there was a shortage of 1d stamps, so stocks of the Queen Victoria 2\u00bdd stamp of 1885 were [[overprint]]ed \"One Penny\" at the Government Printing Office in Valletta. One stamp in each sheet had an [[Errors, freaks, and oddities|error]] such that the overprint read \"One Pnney\".

The frame of the stamps was based on the halfpenny yellow of 1860 but they included the portrait of the new monarch [[Edward VII]] with a royal crown added on top. Meanwhile, the 1886 5/- and the 1899\u20131901 pictorials remained in use. A new watermark was introduced in October 1904, and subsequent reprints of the 1899\u20131901 pictorials and 1903\u20131904 definitives were with this new watermark. From 1907 to 1911 there were some colour changes, and some bicoloured stamps were reissued in one colour.

These stamps had [[Key type stamp|standard keytype design]]s which were used in various other British colonies, and they were inscribed \"POSTAGE REVENUE\" since they were [[postage and revenue stamp|equally valid for postal and fiscal use]]. The lower values between \u00bcd and 1/- had a smaller size than the 2/- and 5/- high values. A pictorial 4d value which was similar to the 1901 \u00bcd was also issued, and the 2/6 of 1899 was reprinted with a new watermark in 1919. That year, a [[Malta Saint Paul 10s black|10/- value]] with a modified version of the 1899 St Paul's Shipwreck design was also released. Only 1530 copies of this stamp were issued, and it today it is Malta's most expensive stamp.<ref name=\"gsm2019\"/>\n\nTwo [[war tax stamp]]s with denominations of \u00bdd and 3d were issued in 1917 and 1918 to raise revenue for [[World War I]]. In late 1921 and early 1922, some of the 1914\u20131919 issues were reprinted with a new watermark (including the 10/- value, but this is not as scarce as the 1919 issue). The 2d value of this issue had a new design. On 15 April 1922, this stamp was also issued locally surcharged \"One Farthing\" after there was a shortage of \u00bcd stamps.<ref name=\"gsm2019\"/>\n\n;Self-Government and Melita issues (1922\u20131926)\n[[File:Malta 1926 Melita Postage 3d black on yellow overprint inverted.jpg|thumb|upright|The 3d stamp from the [[Melita issue]] with the 1926 \"POSTAGE\" [[Invert error|overprint inverted]]]]\n{{further|Melita issue}}\n\nIn 1921, Malta was granted a limited form of [[self-governing colony|self-government]] which led to the establishment of a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]].

These stamps were printed by [[Waterlow and Sons]] instead of De La Rue (which had printed all Malta stamps since 1860). The lower values of \u00bcd to 6d depict George V and the [[coat of arms of Malta]], while the higher values of 1/- to 10/- have different engraved designs. Air mail was introduced on 1 April 1928, and the 6d stamp was issued overprinted \"AIR MAIL\" as Malta's first [[airmail stamp]].<ref name=\"gsm2019\"/>\n\nIn 1928, it was decided that dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps would be issued once again instead of having separate issues. The 1926\u20131927 stamps were issued with \"POSTAGE AND REVENUE\" overprints in 1928, and a series of stamps with amended inscriptions was issued in 1930.<ref name=\"gsm2019\"/>\n\n;King George VI pictorial issues and Self-Government overprints (1938\u20131953)\n[[File:MLT 1948 MiNr0201 pmB002.jpg|thumb|upright|1d stamp of the [[George VI]] issue depicting the [[Verdala Palace]], with the 1948 Self-Government overprint]]\n\nIn 1938, a new definitive set of stamps with denominations between \u00bcd and 10/- depicting the new monarch [[George VI]] and pictorial scenes was issued. Some of the pictorial scenes were reused from the 1926\u20131930 definitives, while some values had completely new designs. All the stamps were printed by Waterlow. The \u00bcd value was the only stamp in the set which did not depict the monarch; instead it was based on the 1901 \u00bcd stamp, but with the scene modernised to show how the Grand Harbour looked like in the 1930s and with the ''GRI'' monogram representing the monarch. Six stamps from this set were reissued in new colours in 1943.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Malta was granted self-government once again, and in 1948 this was commemorated by overprinting the George VI definitives with the text \"SELF-GOVERNMENT 1947\". In 1953, six stamps were reissued with colour changes, still bearing the overprint. Most of these did not exist in these colours without the overprint. A variety of the 1\u00bdd green exists in which the overprint is albino, such that it appears to be omitted.

The \u00bcd to 2/- were printed by [[Bradbury Wilkinson and Company]], while the four high values between 2/6 and \u00a31 were printed by Waterlow. The stamps depicted various monuments, churches and historic sites in Malta such as the [[Great Siege Monument]], [[Auberge de Castille]], ''[[Les Gavroches]]'' and various monuments in [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]], along with scrolls presented to Malta by George VI and President [[Franklin D.

Malta issued such stamps for the [[silver jubilee]] of George V (1935), the [[coronation of George VI and Elizabeth|coronation of George VI]] (1937), victory at the end of World War II (1946), the [[Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Royal Silver Wedding]] (1949), the 75th anniversary of the UPU (1949), the [[coronation of Elizabeth II]] (1953), Freedom from Hunger (1963) and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] centenary (1963).<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\nIn 1950, Malta issued a set of three stamps on the occasion of the visit of Princess Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) to Malta. Other commemorative issues followed in subsequent years, with issues for the 7th centenary of the Scapular in 1951, and for another royal visit by Elizabeth II and the centenary of the [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] both in 1954. In 1960, a set of [[stamps on stamps]] was issued to commemorate the centenary of the Halfpenny Yellow, and in 1962 a set of stamps was issued to commemorate the [[Great Siege of Malta]] of 1565.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\nA set of stamps commemorating the [[award of the George Cross to Malta]] was issued in 1957, and it was designed by the Maltese artist [[Emvin Cremona]]. This is notable since Cremona would design hundreds of Malta stamps until the 1970s. Other early stamp designs by Cremona include issues commemorating technical education (1958), other issues commemorating the George Cross award (1958, 1959 and 1961), the 19th centenary of St Paul's Shipwreck (1960), an Anti-[[Brucellosis]] Congress (1964) and the First European Congress of Catholic Doctors (1964); the latter was the last set of Malta stamps issued during British colonial rule, having been issued two weeks before independence. Most commemorative issues from the mid-1950s until independence were printed by [[Harrison and Sons]], but a few were printed by Bradbury Wilkinson or Waterlow.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n===Independence and republic (since 1964)===\n[[File:Maltaapproval2001.jpg|thumb|A packet of Malta stamps from the 1990s]]\n\nMalta achieved independence as the [[State of Malta]] on 21 September 1964, and on that day a set of six stamps was issued to commemorate the event. The stamps depicted a dove representing peace along with a [[St Edward's Crown|British crown]], a [[Papal tiara]] and the [[Flag of the United Nations|United Nations emblem]]. A definitive set depicting scenes from [[History of Malta|Malta's history]] was issued in 1965, and two additional values were issued in 1970. The independence set and the definitive were designed by Cremona, as were most stamps until the 1970s. Many stamps of the mid-1960s exist with flaws or errors such as missing colours, most notably the 1965\u20131970 definitive.<ref name=\"sg\"/>  Some stamps from this definitive were also issued in [[postage stamp booklet]]s in 1970 and 1971.<ref name=\"jb2014-145-148\">{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2014|pp=145\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nMalta adopted the [[Maltese lira|Maltese pound or lira]] in 1972, and this event was commemorated by stamps showing the new coins. Some stamps of the 1965 definitive were subsequently surcharged in 1972 and 1977, and a definitive set in the new currency was issued in 1973. This set showed various scenes while the top value of \u00a3M2 was larger and depicted the country's coat of arms. Malta became a republic on 13 December 1974 and stamps commemorating this were issued in early 1975. The coat of arms was changed at this point, and a new version of the \u00a3M2 definitive was issued in 1976 to reflect this.<ref name=\"jb2014-22-122\"/>\n\nOther decimal currency definitives depicted the history of Maltese industry (1981), the Maltese Islands' natural and artistic heritage (1991), and flowers (1999\u20132006).

Some of the cards exist in two versions: as a single card and as a reply card (the latter consisting of two cards attached together, intended to allow recipients to send a reply without paying any postage themselves). In 1927 and 1936, postal cards which included imprinted versions of the contemporary George V postage stamps were issued, followed by cards with imprinted versions of the [[George VI]] pictorial definitives in 1938 and 1944.<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/>\n\nSince 1980, Malta has issued postal cards for philatelic purposes. Most of them have an imprinted version of [[Europa postage stamp|EUROPA stamps]], but there are a few exceptions which have actual adhesive stamps affixed instead of imprinted versions. Cards were issued almost annually for international philatelic exhibitions between 1980 and 2006, and for local philatelic exhibitions since 2007. In 1989 an additional postal card was issued to commemorate the 25th anniversary of independence, and in 2009 cards was issued for both an international and a local exhibition.<ref>{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2014|pp=149\u2013157}}</ref>\n\nOccasion cards which usually bear an imprinted stamp have also been issued since 2001. These are similar to the philatelic postal cards, and they commemorate an event, anniversary or a philatelic exhibition.<ref>{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2014|pp=171\u2013176}}</ref>\n\n===Newspaper wrappers===\n[[File:Malta 1898 newspaper wrapper.jpg|thumb|A [[newspaper wrapper]] sent from Valletta to [[Tripoli]] in 1898]]\n\nNewspaper wrappers were issued between 1885 and 1913. Only three wrappers were issued, and they were all denominated \u00bdd and depicted the reigning monarch (Victoria, Edward VII or George V).<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/>\n\n===Registered envelopes===\nRegistered envelopes were issued between 1885 and 1995. Colonial-era envelopes came in two different sizes and they had an imprinted stamp which depicted the reigning monarch: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, George VI or [[Elizabeth II]]. This imprinted stamp only covered the registration fee, while the actual postage had to be paid by additional postage stamps. They were printed by either [[George McCorquodale|McCorquodale & Co Ltd]] or [[De La Rue]], who imprinted the name of their company on the envelopes. Elizabeth II envelopes initially remained in use after independence, and in 1972 they were overprinted with denominations in the new [[Maltese lira|decimal currency]]. From 1974 to 1995, a number of envelopes with the imprinted stamp showing the [[coat of arms of Malta]] were issued. The country's coat of arms changed twice during this period, first in 1975 and then in 1988, and in both cases envelopes were issued with the old symbols obliterated, usually also being replaced by the new emblem imprinted next to or affixed over the older one.<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/>\n\n===Pre-stamped envelopes===\nMalta issued its first pre-stamped envelopes in 1900. These came in three different sizes, and they had an imprinted 1d stamp depicting Queen Victoria. These proved to be unpopular, and no further pre-stamped envelopes were issued<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/> until this type of postal stationery was reintroduced by MaltaPost on 16 September 2002. The envelopes came in two designs, with imprinted stamps for local mail depicting a [[luzzu]] and those for foreign mail depicting a map.<ref name=\"jb2012-187-190\">{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2012|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> These envelopes were popular, and they were issued in a number of different sizes and formats.<ref>{{cite news |title=Postage-paid envelopes |url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/postage-paid-envelopes.145367 |work=[[Times of Malta]] |date=19 July 2003 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200502141249/https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/postage-paid-envelopes.145367 |archivedate=2 May 2020}}</ref> On 20 May 2006, a new design depicting a Neolithic spiral design was introduced for the local envelopes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Maltapost Issues new postage-paid envelopes |url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-05-13/news/maltapost-issues-new-postage-paid-envelopes-91228/ |work=[[The Malta Independent]] |date=13 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200502141840/https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-05-13/news/maltapost-issues-new-postage-paid-envelopes-91228/ |archivedate=2 May 2020}}</ref> These were also issued in a number of sizes and formats.<ref name=\"jb2012-187-190\"/>\n\nAnother new design of local pre-stamped envelopes was introduced in 2011.

The earliest known letter sent from Malta during the [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|rule of the Order of St John]] is dated 1532. The first formal postal service on the islands was established by the Order in 1708, with the post office being located at the [[Casa del Commun Tesoro]] in [[Valletta]]. The first postal markings on mail appeared later on in the 18th century.\n\nThe postal service was reformed in 1798 during the [[French occupation of Malta]], and the islands were taken over by the British in 1800. In the early 19th century, two separate post offices were established in Malta: the Island Post Office and the Packet Office, with the latter forming part of the [[General Post Office|British Post Office]]. Their operations were amalgamated in 1849, and [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|British postage stamps]] began to be used in Malta in August 1857. Malta's first [[postage stamp]] \u2013 the [[Halfpenny Yellow]] \u2013 was issued in 1860 for use on local mail, while letters sent to foreign destinations continued to be franked with British stamps.\n\nIn 1885, the Malta Post Office was set up and Halfpenny Yellows and British stamps were no longer valid in Malta. A set of six [[definitive stamp]]s along with several types of [[postal stationery]] were issued. Malta continued to issue stamps and stationery throughout the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. At some points from the 1880s to the 1980s, postage stamps were also valid for fiscal use, but at times separate [[Revenue stamps of Malta|revenue stamps]] were issued. [[Postage due]] stamps were issued between 1925 and the 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, the private limited company Posta Limited was set up to run the postal service. The public limited company [[MaltaPost]] took over in 1998, and was gradually privatized between 2002 and 2008.\n\n==Postal history==\n===Hospitaller rule (1530\u20131798)===\n[[File:Casino Maltese - Knights Treasury - Valletta Malta.jpeg|thumb|The [[Casa del Commun Tesoro]] in [[Valletta]], which housed the first post office in Malta between 1708 and 1849]]\n\nThe earliest known information about mail in Malta is from when the islands were under [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Hospitaller rule]]. It is believed that prior to the Order's arrival in Malta in 1530, correspondence between Malta and [[Sicily]] was carried on private vessels such as [[speronara]]s for a fee.

Other early stamp designs by Cremona include issues commemorating technical education (1958), other issues commemorating the George Cross award (1958, 1959 and 1961), the 19th centenary of St Paul's Shipwreck (1960), an Anti-[[Brucellosis]] Congress (1964) and the First European Congress of Catholic Doctors (1964); the latter was the last set of Malta stamps issued during British colonial rule, having been issued two weeks before independence. Most commemorative issues from the mid-1950s until independence were printed by [[Harrison and Sons]], but a few were printed by Bradbury Wilkinson or Waterlow.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n===Independence and republic (since 1964)===\n[[File:Maltaapproval2001.jpg|thumb|A packet of Malta stamps from the 1990s]]\n\nMalta achieved independence as the [[State of Malta]] on 21 September 1964, and on that day a set of six stamps was issued to commemorate the event. The stamps depicted a dove representing peace along with a [[St Edward's Crown|British crown]], a [[Papal tiara]] and the [[Flag of the United Nations|United Nations emblem]]. A definitive set depicting scenes from [[History of Malta|Malta's history]] was issued in 1965, and two additional values were issued in 1970. The independence set and the definitive were designed by Cremona, as were most stamps until the 1970s. Many stamps of the mid-1960s exist with flaws or errors such as missing colours, most notably the 1965\u20131970 definitive.<ref name=\"sg\"/>  Some stamps from this definitive were also issued in [[postage stamp booklet]]s in 1970 and 1971.<ref name=\"jb2014-145-148\">{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2014|pp=145\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nMalta adopted the [[Maltese lira|Maltese pound or lira]] in 1972, and this event was commemorated by stamps showing the new coins. Some stamps of the 1965 definitive were subsequently surcharged in 1972 and 1977, and a definitive set in the new currency was issued in 1973. This set showed various scenes while the top value of \u00a3M2 was larger and depicted the country's coat of arms. Malta became a republic on 13 December 1974 and stamps commemorating this were issued in early 1975. The coat of arms was changed at this point, and a new version of the \u00a3M2 definitive was issued in 1976 to reflect this.<ref name=\"jb2014-22-122\"/>\n\nOther decimal currency definitives depicted the history of Maltese industry (1981), the Maltese Islands' natural and artistic heritage (1991), and flowers (1999\u20132006). The 1981 and 1991 definitives were each issued at one go,<ref name=\"jb2014-22-122\"/> and in 1994 some stamps from the 1991 definitive were issued in booklets.<ref name=\"jb2014-145-148\"/> The flowers definitives were issued in installments, and they included Malta's only [[self-adhesive stamp]]s which were issued exclusively in booklets in 2003 and 2004.<ref name=\"jb2014-22-122\"/> In 2002, postage labels which were dispensed from vending machines were also issued.<ref name=\"jb2014-125-127\">{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2014|pp=125\u2013127}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Stamp dispensing machine at St Luke's Hospital |url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/stamp-dispensing-machine-at-st-lukes-hospital.164730 |work=[[Times of Malta]] |date=20 October 2002 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200504230341/https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/stamp-dispensing-machine-at-st-lukes-hospital.164730 |archivedate=4 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1964 to 1972, most stamps were printed by Harrison or De La Rue, but some were printed by the Government Printing Works in [[Rome]], by [[Joh.

The first set consisted of ten imperforate [[provisional stamp]]s with denominations ranging from \u00bdd to 1/6, and they were typeset at the Government Printing Office in Valletta. The stamps had simple numeral designs, and they were printed such that ''[[t\u00eate-b\u00eache]]'' pairs occurred within each sheet.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\nOn 20 July 1925, a new set of postage due stamps which had been printed by Bradbury Wilkinson in Britain was issued in Malta. These had the same face values as the provisional issue, and they had a design featuring a [[Maltese cross]] and were printed in different colours. This design continued to be used until after independence, and many reprints were made resulting in the stamps existing with various different paper types, perforations, watermarks and colour shades.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\nDecimal currency postage due stamps inscribed ''Taxxa Postali'' ([[Maltese language|Maltese]] for \"postal tax\") were issued in 1973, and their design consisted of a numeral overlaid on a [[Maltese lace]] background. A final set of postage dues was issued in 1993, depicting a Neolithic spiral design from one of the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temples]] found in the islands.<ref name=\"jb2014-125-127\"/>\n\n==Postal stationery==\nMalta has issued [[postal stationery]] items since 1885. [[Postal card]]s (including reply cards), [[Wrapper (philately)|newspaper wrappers]] and [[registered envelope]]s were the first postal stationery items to be issued, concurrently with the first definitive stamps, while [[Stamped envelope|pre-stamped envelopes]] and [[aerogram]]mes were introduced later on.<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\">{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2012|pp=177\u2013186}}</ref> Most of these were discontinued at various points during the 20th century, but as of 2020 pre-stamped envelopes are still in use while pre-stamped postal cards are still issued regularly for philatelic purposes.\n\n===Postal cards===\nBetween 1885 and 1917, various \u00bdd and 1d postal cards were issued for local and foreign rates respectively. These cards bore an [[imprinted stamp]] which depicted the reigning monarch: initially [[Queen Victoria]] and later King [[Edward VII]] or [[George V]]. Some of the cards exist in two versions: as a single card and as a reply card (the latter consisting of two cards attached together, intended to allow recipients to send a reply without paying any postage themselves). In 1927 and 1936, postal cards which included imprinted versions of the contemporary George V postage stamps were issued, followed by cards with imprinted versions of the [[George VI]] pictorial definitives in 1938 and 1944.<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/>\n\nSince 1980, Malta has issued postal cards for philatelic purposes. Most of them have an imprinted version of [[Europa postage stamp|EUROPA stamps]], but there are a few exceptions which have actual adhesive stamps affixed instead of imprinted versions. Cards were issued almost annually for international philatelic exhibitions between 1980 and 2006, and for local philatelic exhibitions since 2007. In 1989 an additional postal card was issued to commemorate the 25th anniversary of independence, and in 2009 cards was issued for both an international and a local exhibition.<ref>{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2014|pp=149\u2013157}}</ref>\n\nOccasion cards which usually bear an imprinted stamp have also been issued since 2001. These are similar to the philatelic postal cards, and they commemorate an event, anniversary or a philatelic exhibition.<ref>{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2014|pp=171\u2013176}}</ref>\n\n===Newspaper wrappers===\n[[File:Malta 1898 newspaper wrapper.jpg|thumb|A [[newspaper wrapper]] sent from Valletta to [[Tripoli]] in 1898]]\n\nNewspaper wrappers were issued between 1885 and 1913. Only three wrappers were issued, and they were all denominated \u00bdd and depicted the reigning monarch (Victoria, Edward VII or George V).<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/>\n\n===Registered envelopes===\nRegistered envelopes were issued between 1885 and 1995. Colonial-era envelopes came in two different sizes and they had an imprinted stamp which depicted the reigning monarch: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, George VI or [[Elizabeth II]]. This imprinted stamp only covered the registration fee, while the actual postage had to be paid by additional postage stamps. They were printed by either [[George McCorquodale|McCorquodale & Co Ltd]] or [[De La Rue]], who imprinted the name of their company on the envelopes. Elizabeth II envelopes initially remained in use after independence, and in 1972 they were overprinted with denominations in the new [[Maltese lira|decimal currency]]. From 1974 to 1995, a number of envelopes with the imprinted stamp showing the [[coat of arms of Malta]] were issued. The country's coat of arms changed twice during this period, first in 1975 and then in 1988, and in both cases envelopes were issued with the old symbols obliterated, usually also being replaced by the new emblem imprinted next to or affixed over the older one.<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/>\n\n===Pre-stamped envelopes===\nMalta issued its first pre-stamped envelopes in 1900. These came in three different sizes, and they had an imprinted 1d stamp depicting Queen Victoria. These proved to be unpopular, and no further pre-stamped envelopes were issued<ref name=\"jb2012-177-186\"/> until this type of postal stationery was reintroduced by MaltaPost on 16 September 2002. The envelopes came in two designs, with imprinted stamps for local mail depicting a [[luzzu]] and those for foreign mail depicting a map.<ref name=\"jb2012-187-190\">{{harvnb|Buttigieg|2012|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> These envelopes were popular, and they were issued in a number of different sizes and formats.<ref>{{cite news |title=Postage-paid envelopes |url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/postage-paid-envelopes.145367 |work=[[Times of Malta]] |date=19 July 2003 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200502141249/https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/postage-paid-envelopes.145367 |archivedate=2 May 2020}}</ref> On 20 May 2006, a new design depicting a Neolithic spiral design was introduced for the local envelopes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Maltapost Issues new postage-paid envelopes |url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-05-13/news/maltapost-issues-new-postage-paid-envelopes-91228/ |work=[[The Malta Independent]] |date=13 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200502141840/https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-05-13/news/maltapost-issues-new-postage-paid-envelopes-91228/ |archivedate=2 May 2020}}</ref> These were also issued in a number of sizes and formats.<ref name=\"jb2012-187-190\"/>\n\nAnother new design of local pre-stamped envelopes was introduced in 2011.
