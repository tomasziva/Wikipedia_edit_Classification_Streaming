The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] celebrating an annual national holiday known as the Purge. All crimes including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, all while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party called the ''New Founding Fathers of America'', or ''NFFA'' for short, as an act of desperation after an economic collapse and recession.\n\nHowever, in the installment of [[The First Purge]] (2018), it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s true intent with the holiday is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge depicts a 'trial run' in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released.\n\n[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] (2013) takes place after the holiday has gone nation-wide. Specifically centered on a wealthy family of four surviving through the night, after taking in a  complete stranger on the run from Purge participants.\n\nThe second released, [[The Purge: Anarchy]] (2014), depicts how the purge is turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves.\n\nThe third and final installment is [[The Purge: Election Year]] (2016). A Senator, and presidential candidate, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on a purge night. Election Year was the first Purge where politicians were ''not'' immune. An attempt organized by the NFFA to have her killed in the hopes it would keep the annual purge going.\n\nThe [[The Purge (TV series)|TV series]] (2018) entitled The Purge, is a [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] that takes place in 2027, which puts it in between ''Anarchy'' and ''Election Year'' in the timeline.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | #bang me\n! scope=\"col\" | US Release Date\n! scope=\"col\" | CBT\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter\n! scope=\"col\" | Producers\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2013|6|7}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[James DeMonaco]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" | James DeMonaco\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]], Sebastien Lemercier\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|7|18}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2016|7|1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The First Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2018|7|4}}\n| Gerard McMurray\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier, James DeMonaco\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''The Forever Purge''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2020|7|10}}\n|Everardo Gout<ref name=\"Everardo Gout\" />\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier\n|}\n\n===''The Purge'' (2013)===\n{{main|The Purge (2013 film)}}\n'''''The Purge''''' stars [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Max Burkholder]], [[Adelaide Kane]], [[Edwin Hodge]], [[Tony Oller]], [[Rhys Wakefield]] and [[Arija Bareikis]].\n\nThe film follows the experience of the Sandin family on Purge night of the year 2022. The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next 12-hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget. The film was turned into a [[Halloween Horror Nights#Scare zones|scare zone]] in 2014 for [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] due to its success.\n\n===''The Purge: Anarchy'' (2014)===\n{{main|The Purge: Anarchy}}\n'''''The Purge: Anarchy''''', released worldwide on July 18, 2014,<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |title=Universal Re-Slots ''The Purge: Anarchy'' |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/02/universal-re-slots-the-purge-anarchy |accessdate=1 March 2014 |newspaper=Deadline.com |date=28 February 2014}}</ref> stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], [[Zo\u00eb Soul]] and [[Michael K.

The wounded stranger from the first film is the partner of Carmelo Johns, leader of an anti-Purge resistance group that hacks into TV programs to broadcast messages challenging the system, stating that the Purge does not cleanse aggression, but rather eliminates the poor.\n\nThe film was met with generally mixed reviews, though many critics agreed it was a large improvement over the first film, and was a box office success, grossing $111.9 million compared to its $9 million budget.\n\n===''The Purge: Election Year'' (2016)===\n{{main|The Purge: Election Year}}\nThe third film was released on July 1, 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/purge-3-gets-2016-release-762131|title='The Purge 3' Gets 2016 Release Date|author=Natalie Stone|date=8 January 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> in which Frank Grillo and Edwin Hodge reprise their roles from the previous film, and are joined by [[Elizabeth Mitchell]], who plays Senator Charlie Roan.

In a bid to prevent this from happening, The ''New Founding Fathers of America'' (NFFA) takes the unprecedented step of abolishing the protection afforded to government officials of ranking 10, allowing the U.S. public to target all government officials for the first time since the purge's creation. After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. Meanwhile, NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and went on to gross over $118 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the series.\n\n===''The First Purge'' (2018)===\n{{main|The First Purge}}\nIn September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy.

The organization establishes a new [[totalitarian government]] and a [[police state]]. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7 PM in the evening of March 21 to 7 AM in the morning of March 22 wherein ''all'' crime becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying ''\"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation rebo''rn\" before ending with \"''May God be with you all''\".  \n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the full 12-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10+ are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Classes 1-4\" weaponry are permitted\n\nBelow is how the Emergency Broadcast System announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''The Purge: Election Year'' (taking place 20 years after establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28<sup>th</sup> Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''The First Purge'', taking place in 2017 on Staten Island, New York, which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, 1 year prior to the first nationwide Purge. Below shows the commencement speech as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n'''''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the NFFA Social Experiment on Staten Island, New York.'''''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the experiment.''\n''Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Staten Island Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although its thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it's actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets. In ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event is presumed to have ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n*{{note label|Young|Y}}= actor plays younger \n*version of character.\n*{{note label|Voice|V}}= actor/actress only voice acted for their character.\n* Dark gray cell = character was not in film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Characters\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Films\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy|Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year|Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge|First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!

The films present a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period.  \n\nThe franchise began in 2013 with ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]'', directed by the franchise creator DeMonaco, who also directed two of the sequels and wrote the screenplays for all, including the yet-unnamed Purge 5 which, he has hinted in interviews, could be the end of the franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/05/13/purge-5-release-date/|title='The Purge 5' to be released next year|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> In addition to films, the franchise has spawned [[The Purge (TV series)|a television series]] which premiered on September 4, 2018; DeMonaco wrote its pilot episode.   \n\nThe franchise has received a generally mixed critical reception, mainly for the screenwriting and clich\u00e9d stories, but was praised for the concept, acting, style, and action sequences. The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] celebrating an annual national holiday known as the Purge. All crimes including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, all while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party called the ''New Founding Fathers of America'', or ''NFFA'' for short, as an act of desperation after an economic collapse and recession.\n\nHowever, in the installment of [[The First Purge]] (2018), it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s true intent with the holiday is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge depicts a 'trial run' in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released.\n\n[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] (2013) takes place after the holiday has gone nation-wide. Specifically centered on a wealthy family of four surviving through the night, after taking in a  complete stranger on the run from Purge participants.\n\nThe second released, [[The Purge: Anarchy]] (2014), depicts how the purge is turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves.\n\nThe third and final installment is [[The Purge: Election Year]] (2016). A Senator, and presidential candidate, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on a purge night. Election Year was the first Purge where politicians were ''not'' immune. An attempt organized by the NFFA to have her killed in the hopes it would keep the annual purge going.\n\nThe [[The Purge (TV series)|TV series]] (2018) entitled The Purge, is a [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] that takes place in 2027, which puts it in between ''Anarchy'' and ''Election Year'' in the timeline.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | US Release Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter\n! scope=\"col\" | Producers\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2013|6|7}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[James DeMonaco]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" | James DeMonaco\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]], Sebastien Lemercier\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|7|18}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2016|7|1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The First Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2018|7|4}}\n| Gerard McMurray\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier, James DeMonaco\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''The Forever Purge''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2020|7|10}}\n|Everardo Gout<ref name=\"Everardo Gout\" />\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier\n|}\n\n===''The Purge'' (2013)===\n{{main|The Purge (2013 film)}}\n'''''The Purge''''' stars [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Max Burkholder]], [[Adelaide Kane]], [[Edwin Hodge]], [[Tony Oller]], [[Rhys Wakefield]] and [[Arija Bareikis]].\n\nThe film follows the experience of the Sandin family on Purge night of the year 2022. The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next 12-hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget. The film was turned into a [[Halloween Horror Nights#Scare zones|scare zone]] in 2014 for [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] due to its success.\n\n===''The Purge: Anarchy'' (2014)===\n{{main|The Purge: Anarchy}}\n'''''The Purge: Anarchy''''', released worldwide on July 18, 2014,<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |title=Universal Re-Slots ''The Purge: Anarchy'' |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/02/universal-re-slots-the-purge-anarchy |accessdate=1 March 2014 |newspaper=Deadline.com |date=28 February 2014}}</ref> stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], [[Zo\u00eb Soul]] and [[Michael K.

The wounded stranger from the first film is the partner of Carmelo Johns, leader of an anti-Purge resistance group that hacks into TV programs to broadcast messages challenging the system, stating that the Purge does not cleanse aggression, but rather eliminates the poor.\n\nThe film was met with generally mixed reviews, though many critics agreed it was a large improvement over the first film, and was a box office success, grossing $111.9 million compared to its $9 million budget.\n\n===''The Purge: Election Year'' (2016)===\n{{main|The Purge: Election Year}}\nThe third film was released on July 1, 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/purge-3-gets-2016-release-762131|title='The Purge 3' Gets 2016 Release Date|author=Natalie Stone|date=8 January 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> in which Frank Grillo and Edwin Hodge reprise their roles from the previous film, and are joined by [[Elizabeth Mitchell]], who plays Senator Charlie Roan.

In a bid to prevent this from happening, The ''New Founding Fathers of America'' (NFFA) takes the unprecedented step of abolishing the protection afforded to government officials of ranking 10, allowing the U.S. public to target all government officials for the first time since the purge's creation. After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. Meanwhile, NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and went on to gross over $118 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the series.\n\n===''The First Purge'' (2018)===\n{{main|The First Purge}}\nIn September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy.

The Purge starts its trial run in the year 2017, confined only on [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. While only small crimes take place during the event, a corrupt official in the NFFA tampers with the experiment by adding mercenaries to increase casualties and to gain more favor. \n\nIn February 2017, DeMonaco announced that a fourth installment was in development.

In an interview with ''Scream'', ''The Purge'' television series [[showrunner]] Thomas Kelly stated that a [[heist film]] set on Purge Night has been considered; this plot point was later used in the series' second season.<ref>''Scream'' Issue #50 - Horror TV: On Set for ''The Purge''</ref>\n\n==Event==\nIn 2014, following an economic collapse and rising social unrest, a political organization named ''The New Founding Fathers of America'' (NFFA) is formed and is voted into office. The organization establishes a new [[totalitarian government]] and a [[police state]]. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7 PM in the evening of March 21 to 7 AM in the morning of March 22 wherein ''all'' crime becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying ''\"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation rebo''rn\" before ending with \"''May God be with you all''\".  \n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the full 12-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10+ are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Classes 1-4\" weaponry are permitted\n\nBelow is how the Emergency Broadcast System announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''The Purge: Election Year'' (taking place 20 years after establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28<sup>th</sup> Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''The First Purge'', taking place in 2017 on Staten Island, New York, which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, 1 year prior to the first nationwide Purge. Below shows the commencement speech as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n'''''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the NFFA Social Experiment on Staten Island, New York.'''''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the experiment.''\n''Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Staten Island Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although its thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it's actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets. In ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event is presumed to have ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n*{{note label|Young|Y}}= actor plays younger \n*version of character.\n*{{note label|Voice|V}}= actor/actress only voice acted for their character.\n* Dark gray cell = character was not in film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Characters\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Films\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy|Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year|Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge|First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!
