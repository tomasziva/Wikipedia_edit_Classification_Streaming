We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used.\" \"People have a [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal and then a [[reverberation|reverb]] pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently.\"<ref name=\"Undercover TV interview\">{{cite web|title=Undercover TV interview|url=http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|publisher=Undercover TV|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121231011401/http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|archivedate=31 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker's process for making music is \"I\u2019ll have a sudden, spontaneous vision of a song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and do my best to record it as quick as I can. I\u2019ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I\u2019ll have a whole bunch of them [demos] and then I\u2019ll just choose which ones to make into full songs\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" /> Parker has a strong sense of [[melody]] in his music, having composed \"excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15\".<ref name=\"LA Times interview\">{{cite web|title=LA Times interview|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archivedate=21 December 2011}}</ref> For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, \"I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" /> Parker also said \"Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n===Influences===\n[[File:Tame Impala @ La Riviera, Madrid (9280795653).jpg|thumb|Tame Impala's music and live visuals are heavily influenced by psychedelic music.]]\nParker's music is heavily influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s [[psychedelic rock]],<ref>{{cite web |author=K.

It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala Sopitas interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala en entrevista para Sopitas.com|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|via=YouTube|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017181404/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|archivedate=17 October 2013}}</ref> Tame Impala live drummer Jay Watson has described Parker's music as containing \"[[shoegaze]]y guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala Hartzine interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala Hartzine interview|url=http://vimeo.com/18386586|via=Vimeo|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928091551/http://vimeo.com/18386586|archivedate=28 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Electronic dance music|Electronic music]] is another influence. Parker has used rock instrumentation in an electronic manner, saying \"The way we do music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost in a kind of electronic nature. Using our playing as though it was a living sample\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala KCRW interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala KCRW interview|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|publisher=KCRW|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721173821/http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|archivedate=21 July 2012}}</ref> A heavy feature on ''[[Innerspeaker]]'' is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a [[synthesizer|synth]]. Parker mentioned this by saying \"I had a few obsessions when recording ''Innerspeaker''. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\nParker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, \"I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n[[Lo-fi]] music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the ''[[Tame Impala EP]]''. With the release of ''Innerspeaker'', Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic [[wall of sound]], helped by mixer [[Dave Fridmann]]. Parker explained \"It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala \u2013 Inner Visions|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|publisher=Mess and Noise|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630160656/http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|archivedate=30 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker has also stated that [[Supertramp]], one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala.

We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used.\" \"People have a [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal and then a [[reverberation|reverb]] pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something.

But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" /> Parker also said \"Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything.

Using our playing as though it was a living sample\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala KCRW interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala KCRW interview|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|publisher=KCRW|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721173821/http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|archivedate=21 July 2012}}</ref> A heavy feature on ''[[Innerspeaker]]'' is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a [[synthesizer|synth]]. Parker mentioned this by saying \"I had a few obsessions when recording ''Innerspeaker''. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\nParker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, \"I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n[[Lo-fi]] music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the ''[[Tame Impala EP]]''. With the release of ''Innerspeaker'', Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic [[wall of sound]], helped by mixer [[Dave Fridmann]]. Parker explained \"It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala \u2013 Inner Visions|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|publisher=Mess and Noise|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630160656/http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|archivedate=30 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker has also stated that [[Supertramp]], one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala. Despite their difference in sound, he feels he is always somewhat \"channeling Supertramp\".<ref name=\"TheVine-interview-2014\">{{cite web
