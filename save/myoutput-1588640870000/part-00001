The Jetix name was applied to its programming blocks which aired on ABC Family and Toon Disney, its television channels in Europe and Latin America, along with its programme library and merchandising.<ref name=\"Edmunds\"/>\n\nThe Jetix name was chosen after the company conducted international research specifically with a number of children focus groups. Many of the children picked the name as it implied action and adventure, and the company was able to use the name internationally due to its ambiguity. Bruce Steinberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Kids Europe, explain that Jetix would help strengthen Fox Kids Europe's partnership with Disney while building new alliances to continue to successfully leverage its programming library and distribution.<ref name=ds>{{cite news|last=Welsh|first=James|title=Fox Kids to be rebranded as Jetix|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a12962/fox-kids-to-be-rebranded-as-jetix.html|accessdate=February 24, 2014|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=January 9, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Ryan|title=ABC, Fox Kids Launch Action Blocks|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/abc-fox-kids-launch-action-blocks/|accessdate=May 13, 2014|newspaper=Animation Magazine|date=January 9, 2004}}</ref>\n\nOn February 14, 2004, [[Toon Disney]] and [[ABC Family]] launched their Jetix blocks with Jetix Cards Live, the world's first concurrently online and telecast trading card game.<ref name=amag>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Ryan|title=Toon Disney Launches Jetix, Live Card Game |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/toon-disney-launches-jetix-live-card-game/|accessdate=March 3, 2014|newspaper=Animation Magazine|date=February 13, 2004}}</ref> Toon Disney had 12 hours of weekly prime time programming to start, and ABC Family had two hours on weekdays and four hours on weekends, all in the morning.<ref name=mcn>{{cite news|last=Umstead|first=R.

The company became a publicly traded company in November 1999 with [[Fox Family Worldwide]] holding a 75.7% majority stake and the other 24.3% being listed on [[Euronext]]. By then, Fox Kids Europe had launched 6 different channel feeds: [[Disney XD (UK & Ireland)|United Kingdom]], [[Disney XD (Dutch TV channel)|Netherlands]], [[Disney XD (France)|France]], [[Disney XD (Poland)|Poland]], [[Disney XD (Scandinavia)|Scandinavia]] and [[Disney XD (Spain)|Spain]].\n\nIn 2000, 5 additional Fox Kids feeds launched: [[Disney Channel (Russia)|Russia and ex-Soviet countries]], [[Disney XD (Italy)|Italy]], [[Disney XD (Turkey)|Turkey]], [[Disney XD (Germany)|Germany]], [[Disney Channel (Hungary)|Hungary]] and the [[Disney XD (Africa)|Middle East]]. These launches made Fox Kids the only children's entertainment company with a local channel in every major European market.\n\nIn February 2001, a Fox Kids feed was launched in [[Disney Channel (Israel)|Israel]], while the Hungarian feed was extended to Czechia and Slovakia, while launching in Russia as a programming block on [[free-to-air]] channel [[Ren TV]].
