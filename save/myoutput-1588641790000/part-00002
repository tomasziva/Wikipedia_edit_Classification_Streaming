These texts exemplify the witch stereotype, more specifically the female nature of it, that was integrated into society at the time.\n\n=== ''The Malleus Maleficarum'' ===\nThe [[Malleus Maleficarum]] is one of the most well-known treatise on witchcraft, written by the Catholic clergyman, Heinrich Kramer, in 1486. The essay is divided into three different parts, each of which meant to convey different information. The first asserts how to preach about witchcraft and how to frame witchcraft in a religious way. The second section includes details about witches specifically, particularly characteristics common in witches, how witchcraft is conducted, as well as who is susceptible to possession.

One such passage from the second section, which focuses on describing witches in great detail, offers insight into how the author viewed women:\n\n\u201cThere are others who give different reasons for why women are found to be superstitious in larger numbers than men, and they say that there are three reasons. The first is that they are prone to believing and because the demon basically seeks to corrupt the Faith, he assails them in particular. Hence Ecclesiasticus 19[4]: \u2018He who quickly believes is fickle in heart and will be made small.\u2019 The second reason in that on account of the tendency of their temperament towards flux they are by nature more easily impressed upon to receive revelations through the impression of the disembodied spirits, and when they use this temperament well, they are very good, but when they use it badly, they are worse. For this reason, is that they have loose tongues and can hardly conceal from their female companions the things that they know through evil art, and since they lack physical strength, they readily seek to avenge themselves through acts of sorcery\u2026 Since they are prone to flux, they can more quickly offer children to the demons, as in fact they do.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis passage from the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' declares that women are ultimately more susceptible to possession from demons, as well as more prone to lash out using witchcraft just on the basis of assumed female characteristics, such as \u201cloose tongues\u201d and \u201clack physical strength\u201d. Because this treatise played such a large role in efforts against witchcraft in the early modern time period<ref name=\":0\" />, it may be assumed that these attitudes about women were widespread and believed by many people in Europe.

Federici also comments on the developing sexual division of labor at the time, due to rising capitalism, and how this impacted stress for women.\n\n===Caliban and The Witch===\n\nIn her book Caliban and the Witch (2004), [[Silvia Federici]] argues that the [[witch-hunts]] were historical events through which occurred the transformation of women's bodies into \u201cwork machines\u201d for the reproduction of the workforce, a necessary precondition of a shift from the [[subsistence]] to the [[monetary economy]]. She remarks that the period the [[witch-hunts]] happened in the world history took place at the same time with the conquest of America, beginning of the [[slave trade|History of slavery]], and expropriation of the peasantry; which all indicate the rise of [[capitalism]]. In her view, the [[witch-hunt]] was the forgotten piece of the historical puzzle of the emergence of capitalism.\n \n====Theoretical background====\n \nAs opposed to [[Marx]]'s claim, according to Federici, the historical shift from a [[subsistence economy]] (production-for-use) to a [[capitalist economy|capitalism]] (production-for-profit) has not caused a liberation of the [[working class]] from scarcity and necessity, but the other way around, the economy has become subject to [[wage labor]] exploitation, [[unpaid work]] of women, and degradation of environmental nature. Because the burden of the structural change in economic relations and the production with [[enclosures]] in the first phase of capitalist development had stood mostly by women, they were the ones who tried to save their lands, social position, and subsistence-oriented agriculture practices. However, governments in Europe, by passing a law that introduced a new crime, i.e. the accusation of [[witchcraft]] \u2014a ''crimen exceptum'' equal to high treason\u2014 they attempted to silence the resistance of women and any other alternative solutions to feudalism other than capitalism. Besides, it allowed primitive accumulation by taking the capacities available for social production as granted, and treated them as free and infinitely available gifts, in the same way how the capitalist system would treat nature.\n\nFederici has expanded the [[Marxist]] analysis of the birth of [[capitalism]] by including the change in the social position of women and the production of [[labor-power]]. The stress is given to the fact that the division of labor is highly gendered. The new sexual division of labor has developed itself with subjugating women's labor, and women's reproductive function to produce labor-force; the undervaluation and subordination of women by excluding them from waged work; and in association with the mechanization of [[workforce]], women's body has also been started to perceived as machines to produce new workers. Federici and many scholars argue that the sexual division of labor with the control of women's body is the precondition to produce the surplus value. The social reproductive theory<ref name=\"test\">[https://marxismocritico.com/2017/10/17/what-is-social-reproduction-theory/]</ref> mainly argues that capitalism exploits women's labor outside the workplace through their invisible, flexible, and unpaid labor.\n\nBesides the structural changes in the spheres of reproduction and in the terrain of the relation between men and women, Federici argues that the shift coming with all the means and tools of [[capital accumulation]] was an attract to communal [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].  Being midwives, their capabilities of healing practices to cure people with herbs and their knowledge of the properties of plants and roots had given them a position in society. With infra-politics of capitalism, the attack on the healer resulted in that the communal production and survival skills were taken away from the society, which had changed the structure of mutual aid, if not eliminated it completely.\n\nThe second scholar which [[Federici|Silvia Federici]] criticizes is [[Michel Foucault]], and she does this through three points. First, before Michel Foucault, feminist activists and theorists understanding of the body were taken as the substantial factor since the early 1970s to analyze the positions of male and female in society ''avant la lettre''. Second, Michel Foucault argues that in modern society, physical violence has declined, and given its place to [[psychological violence|Psychological abuse]].<ref>https://non.copyriot.com/maria-mies-silvia-federici-and-biopower/</ref> By beginning her analysis from [witch-hunts] and giving contemporary examples, she has put emphasize on ongoing violence against women with colonial means of domination of men, which is omitted in Michel Foucault's analysis. Third, she criticizes him for writing the \u201c[[History of Sexuality|The History of Sexuality]]\u201d (1978) from a \u201cuniversal, abstract, asexual subject\u201d<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 16]]</ref> which enabled him to completely omit a historical event of gendered violence as big as the witch-hunt.\n\n====Historical Background====\n\nAfter the [[Black Death]] (1347-1351) drastically reduced the working population in Europe, it was increasingly difficult for feudal lords to control and discipline the peasants. Because of the scarcity of peasants capable of work, the ones who did work developed strategies against the corrupted lords such as leaving the harvest to rot or simply not finishing the work. This was possible due to the [[subsistence economy]] in which the work was being paid for with products and the right to work on the land, not with money like in the monetary economy. They grew their own food and were not dependent on money for buying basic materials.  It was also a [[solidarity economy]] in which women would share labor, such as [[care work]], in between themselves, parallel to sharing work with men, such as working in the field. This division was a source of emancipation rather than the opposite because it enabled them to have autonomy over their work, as well as over their bodies. Women played a big political role in these societies. When the monetary economy was introduced, only men were entitled to receive payment, after which began the marginalization of women's labor from the economical and political realms of the society.\n\nThe majority of witch hunts occurred between 1500 and 1650, with a peak around the 1620, according to [[Silvia Federici|Federici]]. It was the time when the ideology of [[Mercantilism]] shaped the perceptions of European elites. Having a big labor force was a necessary precondition to having a successful economy. In the context of the aftermath of the [[Black Death]], the question of population control was obvious to them, so began the \u201cdemographic recording, census-taking, and the formalization of demography itself as the first \u2018state science\u2019\u201d.<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 182]]</ref> Finding a way of systematically increasing the size of the labor force was an important political goal for the ruling class and the nascent bourgeoisie.\n\nThe way to systematically increase the size of the labor force was to gain control over the reproduction of society. Women were through this lens seen only as wombs that produce children who will enter the labor force. To gain this control the states used \u201cmulti-media propaganda to generate a mass psychosis among the population.\u201d .<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 168]]</ref> This propaganda machine included names such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean Bodin]],<ref name=\"test\" /> but also many other government officials who traveled the countries and spread the propaganda about witches. The state also used the policing apparatus and methods created by the Inquisition in the previous centuries. They successfully sowed distrust which disintegrated small societies. Their main target was lower class women which nevertheless had knowledges that were of crucial importance for the autonomy and integrity of their societies. Knowledge such as healing, birth control, and midwifery came in direct opposition to the state interests and the new [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanical paradigm]]. Many of these women were hunted down, put through unfair trials, and brutally murdered.\n\nOne of the ways to gain control over the reproductive force of the population was to put the practices of midwifery under a strict state control. Many of the witches were also [[midwives]] or \u201cwise women\u201d, and traditionally the practices of [[midwifery]] and [[obstetrics]] were exclusive to women until the 16th and 17th century. In the 16th century there was a new precondition to being a midwife \u2014 the woman had to demonstrate beforehand that she was a \u201cgood Catholic\u201d.<ref>[[Federici, 2004:183]]</ref> In the 17th century there began to appear the first male midwives and \u201cwithin a century, obstetrics has come almost entirely under state control.\u201d<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 183-184]]</ref>\n\nUnder this interpretation, the witch trials in Europe would have been of a political background, rather than strictly gender- focused outlook, religious or otherwise. However, even this explanation for the widespread trials reflects a misogynistic and female-controlling frame of mind.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Witchcraft]]\n*[[Witchcraft#Witchcraft, feminism, and media|Witchcraft, Feminism, and Media]]\n*[[Goddess movement]]\n*[[Catharism#Role of women and gender|Catharism - Role of Women and Gender]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Early Modern witch hunts]]\n[[Category:Feminism]]\n[[Category:Witch trials]]\n", "text_old": "Various [[feminism|feminist]] interpretations of the witch trials of the Early Modern period have been made and published throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Federici also comments on the developing sexual division of labor at the time, due to rising capitalism, and how this impacted stress for women.\n\n===Caliban and The Witch===\n\nIn her book Caliban and the Witch (2004), [[Silvia Federici]] argues that the [[witch-hunts]] were historical events through which occurred the transformation of women's bodies into \u201cwork machines\u201d for the reproduction of the workforce, a necessary precondition of a shift from the [[subsistence]] to the [[monetary economy]]. She remarks that the period the [[witch-hunts]] happened in the world history took place at the same time with the conquest of America, beginning of the [[slave trade|History of slavery]], and expropriation of the peasantry; which all indicate the rise of [[capitalism]]. In her view, the [[witch-hunt]] was the forgotten piece of the historical puzzle of the emergence of capitalism.\n \n====Theoretical background====\n \nAs opposed to [[Marx]]'s claim, according to Federici, the historical shift from a [[subsistence economy]] (production-for-use) to a [[capitalist economy|capitalism]] (production-for-profit) has not caused a liberation of the [[working class]] from scarcity and necessity, but the other way around, the economy has become subject to [[wage labor]] exploitation, [[unpaid work]] of women, and degradation of environmental nature. Because the burden of the structural change in economic relations and the production with [[enclosures]] in the first phase of capitalist development had stood mostly by women, they were the ones who tried to save their lands, social position, and subsistence-oriented agriculture practices. However, governments in Europe, by passing a law that introduced a new crime, i.e. the accusation of [[witchcraft]] \u2014a ''crimen exceptum'' equal to high treason\u2014 they attempted to silence the resistance of women and any other alternative solutions to feudalism other than capitalism. Besides, it allowed primitive accumulation by taking the capacities available for social production as granted, and treated them as free and infinitely available gifts, in the same way how the capitalist system would treat nature.\n\nFederici has expanded the [[Marxist]] analysis of the birth of [[capitalism]] by including the change in the social position of women and the production of [[labor-power]]. The stress is given to the fact that the division of labor is highly gendered. The new sexual division of labor has developed itself with subjugating women's labor, and women's reproductive function to produce labor-force; the undervaluation and subordination of women by excluding them from waged work; and in association with the mechanization of [[workforce]], women's body has also been started to perceived as machines to produce new workers. Federici and many scholars argue that the sexual division of labor with the control of women's body is the precondition to produce the surplus value. The social reproductive theory<ref name=\"test\">[https://marxismocritico.com/2017/10/17/what-is-social-reproduction-theory/]</ref> mainly argues that capitalism exploits women's labor outside the workplace through their invisible, flexible, and unpaid labor.\n\nBesides the structural changes in the spheres of reproduction and in the terrain of the relation between men and women, Federici argues that the shift coming with all the means and tools of [[capital accumulation]] was an attract to communal [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].  Being midwives, their capabilities of healing practices to cure people with herbs and their knowledge of the properties of plants and roots had given them a position in society. With infra-politics of capitalism, the attack on the healer resulted in that the communal production and survival skills were taken away from the society, which had changed the structure of mutual aid, if not eliminated it completely.\n\nThe second scholar which [[Federici|Silvia Federici]] criticizes is [[Michel Foucault]], and she does this through three points. First, before Michel Foucault, feminist activists and theorists understanding of the body were taken as the substantial factor since the early 1970s to analyze the positions of male and female in society ''avant la lettre''. Second, Michel Foucault argues that in modern society, physical violence has declined, and given its place to [[psychological violence|Psychological abuse]].<ref>https://non.copyriot.com/maria-mies-silvia-federici-and-biopower/</ref> By beginning her analysis from [witch-hunts] and giving contemporary examples, she has put emphasize on ongoing violence against women with colonial means of domination of men, which is omitted in Michel Foucault's analysis. Third, she criticizes him for writing the \u201c[[History of Sexuality|The History of Sexuality]]\u201d (1978) from a \u201cuniversal, abstract, asexual subject\u201d<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 16]]</ref> which enabled him to completely omit a historical event of gendered violence as big as the witch-hunt.\n\n====Historical Background====\n\nAfter the [[Black Death]] (1347-1351) drastically reduced the working population in Europe, it was increasingly difficult for feudal lords to control and discipline the peasants. Because of the scarcity of peasants capable of work, the ones who did work developed strategies against the corrupted lords such as leaving the harvest to rot or simply not finishing the work. This was possible due to the [[subsistence economy]] in which the work was being paid for with products and the right to work on the land, not with money like in the monetary economy. They grew their own food and were not dependent on money for buying basic materials.  It was also a [[solidarity economy]] in which women would share labor, such as [[care work]], in between themselves, parallel to sharing work with men, such as working in the field. This division was a source of emancipation rather than the opposite because it enabled them to have autonomy over their work, as well as over their bodies. Women played a big political role in these societies. When the monetary economy was introduced, only men were entitled to receive payment, after which began the marginalization of women's labor from the economical and political realms of the society.\n\nThe majority of witch hunts occurred between 1500 and 1650, with a peak around the 1620, according to [[Silvia Federici|Federici]]. It was the time when the ideology of [[Mercantilism]] shaped the perceptions of European elites. Having a big labor force was a necessary precondition to having a successful economy. In the context of the aftermath of the [[Black Death]], the question of population control was obvious to them, so began the \u201cdemographic recording, census-taking, and the formalization of demography itself as the first \u2018state science\u2019\u201d.<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 182]]</ref> Finding a way of systematically increasing the size of the labor force was an important political goal for the ruling class and the nascent bourgeoisie.\n\nThe way to systematically increase the size of the labor force was to gain control over the reproduction of society. Women were through this lens seen only as wombs that produce children who will enter the labor force. To gain this control the states used \u201cmulti-media propaganda to generate a mass psychosis among the population.\u201d .<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 168]]</ref> This propaganda machine included names such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean Bodin]],<ref name=\"test\" /> but also many other government officials who traveled the countries and spread the propaganda about witches. The state also used the policing apparatus and methods created by the Inquisition in the previous centuries. They successfully sowed distrust which disintegrated small societies. Their main target was lower class women which nevertheless had knowledges that were of crucial importance for the autonomy and integrity of their societies. Knowledge such as healing, birth control, and midwifery came in direct opposition to the state interests and the new [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanical paradigm]]. Many of these women were hunted down, put through unfair trials, and brutally murdered.\n\nOne of the ways to gain control over the reproductive force of the population was to put the practices of midwifery under a strict state control. Many of the witches were also [[midwives]] or \u201cwise women\u201d, and traditionally the practices of [[midwifery]] and [[obstetrics]] were exclusive to women until the 16th and 17th century. In the 16th century there was a new precondition to being a midwife \u2014 the woman had to demonstrate beforehand that she was a \u201cgood Catholic\u201d.<ref>[[Federici, 2004:183]]</ref> In the 17th century there began to appear the first male midwives and \u201cwithin a century, obstetrics has come almost entirely under state control.\u201d<ref>[[Federici, 2004: 183-184]]</ref>\n\nUnder this interpretation, the witch trials in Europe would have been of a political background, rather than strictly gender- focused outlook, religious or otherwise. However, even this explanation for the widespread trials reflects a misogynistic and female-controlling frame of mind.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Witchcraft]]\n*[[Witchcraft#Witchcraft, feminism, and media|Witchcraft, Feminism, and Media]]\n*[[Goddess movement]]\n*[[Catharism#Role of women and gender|Catharism - Role of Women and Gender]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Early Modern witch hunts]]\n[[Category:Feminism]]\n[[Category:Witch trials]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_interpretations_of_the_Early_Modern_witch_trials"}
