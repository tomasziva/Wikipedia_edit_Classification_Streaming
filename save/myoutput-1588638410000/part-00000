The overall color may be black, brown, red, purple or green. The \"shield\" (pronotum or modified [[prothorax]] that covers [[vestigial]] wings) behind the head may have colored markings. The abdomen may appear to be striped. Females have a long [[ovipositor]], which should not be mistaken for a [[stinger]]. Both sexes have long antennae.\n\nMormon crickets may undergo morphological changes triggered by high population densities, similar to those seen in [[locust]]s. The most noticeable change is in coloration: solitary individuals typically have green or purple coloration, while swarming individuals are often black, brown or red.\n\n==Life cycle==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n[[Image:Mormon Cricket, female, Utah.jpg|thumb|200px|Utah, October 2005]]\nMormon cricket eggs hatch mostly in the spring after they are laid, although in some areas eggs may take as many as five years to hatch. Hatching begins when soil temperatures reach {{convert|40|F|C|disp=flip}}. The [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] pass through seven [[instar]]s before reaching the adult stage, typically taking 60 to 90 days.\n\nBreeding begins within 10 to 14 days of reaching the adult stage. The male passes to the female a large [[spermatophore]] which can be up to 27% of his body weight. The spermatophore is mostly food for the female to consume but also contains sperm to fertilize her eggs. This [[Nuptial gift (animal behavior)|nuptial gift]] causes swarming-phase females to compete for males, a behavior not seen in solitary-phase females.\n\nThe female lays her eggs by thrusting her ovipositor deep into the soil. Each female can lay over one hundred eggs, with individual eggs having the appearance of a grain of rice with a gray to purplish color.\n\n==Swarming==\n[[Image:Mormon crickets in Nevada.jpg|thumb|200px|Nevada, summer 2006]]\nThe Mormon cricket exists in populations of relatively low density throughout most of its range. At certain times and places, however, population explosions or infestations occur in which large numbers of the crickets form roving bands. These bands may include millions of individuals and be found with densities of up to 100 individuals per square meter. These infestations may last years or even decades, and are characterized by a gradual increase and then decrease in population. The factors that trigger these infestations are poorly understood, but are thought to be weather-related.\n\nResearch published in 2006 shows that Mormon crickets move in these migratory bands, firstly to find new sources of the critical nutrients of protein and salt, and secondly to avoid being eaten by hungry crickets approaching from the rear. The Mormon cricket's cannibalistic behavior may lead to [[swarm behavior]] because crickets may need to move constantly forward to avoid attacks from behind.<ref name=Simpson_Cannibal>{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=S.J. |author2=Sword, G.A. |author3=Lorch, P.D. |author4= Couzin, I.D. |title=Cannibal crickets on a forced march for protein and salt |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=March 14, 2006 |volume=103 |issue=11 |pages=4152\u20134156 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0508915103 |pmid=16537500 |pmc=1449662}}</ref><ref name=Sword>{{cite web|last=Sword |first=Gregory |title= Mormon Cricket Ecology and Evolution |url=http://www.bio.usyd.edu.au/molecular_ecology/research/crickets.shtml |publisher=University of Sydney, School of Biological Sciences |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen a large band crosses a road, it can create a safety hazard by causing distracted revulsion on the part of the driver, and by causing the road surface to become slick with crushed crickets.

These predators include [[California gull]]s, [[crows]], [[coyote]]s and various rodents. There are no predators that specialize on Mormon crickets, which may be explained by the cricket's migratory habits and large population fluctuations.

This bait kills both the Mormon crickets that eat the bait, and the crickets that eat crickets that have eaten the bait. Insecticides applied directly to crops may kill the insects, but due to the large size of swarms, this method usually does not save the crop from being destroyed.\n\nAs Mormon crickets are flightless, physical barriers may be effective.
