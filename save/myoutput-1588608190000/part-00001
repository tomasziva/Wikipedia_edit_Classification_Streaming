Collection of the [[Museum of the American Revolution]], Philadelphia]]\nThe following is a list of buildings or locations that served as headquarters for General [[George Washington]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Background==\nOn April 19, 1775, the militia of Massachusetts &ndash; later joined by the militias of other New England colonies &ndash; began a [[Siege of Boston|siege at Boston]] to prevent thousands of newly-arrived British troops from moving inland.\n \nOn June 14, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] created a [[Continental Army]], to be formed out of the individual militias of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. The next day, Congress created the position of '''Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army''', and unanimously elected Washington to that position. Congress formally presented him with his commission on June 19, and he departed [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on June 23, headed for Massachusetts. He arrived at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], on July 2, and took command of the siege. It lasted until March 17, 1776, when the British withdrew by ship.\n\n[[Washington's Aides-de-Camp|Washington's headquarters staff]] consisted of a military secretary &ndash; initially, Colonel [[Joseph Reed (politician)|Joseph Reed]]; and four [[Aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] &ndash; initially, [[William Palfrey]], [[Stephen Moylan]], Richard Cary, and [[Robert Hanson Harrison]]. They managed Washington's correspondence, made copies of each day's General Orders (to be distributed to the commanding officer at each military post), and made copies of individual orders from the commander-in-chief.\n\nTraveling with the headquarters staff (his \"family\") and a troop of life-guards (bodyguards), Washington tended to stay at military camps, taverns, houses belonging to Continental Army officers or sympathetic civilians, and vacant houses seized from Loyalists. Topography and geographical features were exploited to protect a headquarters&mdash;before and after the [[Battle of Germantown]], Washington stayed at the Henry Keely House,<ref name=\"Keely\"/> atop a plateau on the west side of the [[Perkiomen Creek]], while the Continental Army camped on the east side of the creek at [[Pennypacker Mills]]; between Washington and the British Army.\n\nWashington's correspondence and expense accounts are useful sources for determining his location on a specific date. For instance: an expense account entry that lists meals &ndash; but not \"use of house\" &ndash; likely indicates that Washington and his staff [[George Washington's tent|pitched their tents]] on the owner's property.\n\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Headquarters==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"5%\"  | Image\n! width=\"20%\"  | Location/GPS Coordinates\n! width=\"15%\"  | Dates\n! width=\"45%\"  | Notes\n|-\n| [[Benjamin Wadsworth#Wadsworth House|Benjamin Wadsworth House]]<ref>[http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=32 Benjamin Wadsworth House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181637/http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=32 |date=2014-04-16 }} from Historic Buildings of Massachusetts.</ref>\n| [[File:Wadsworth House.JPG|100px]]\n| [[Harvard Yard]], 1341 Massachusetts Avenue,<br>[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]<br><small>{{Coord|42.373234|-71.1182814|name=Benjamin Wadsworth House}}</small> \n| July 2 to 15, 1775\n| First of Washington's Headquarters.<br>July 3 &ndash; Washington takes command of the Continental Army.\n|- \n| John Vassall House, ''also known as'' Longfellow House<br>&ndash;[[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site]]\n| [[File:Longfellow National Historic Site, Cambridge, Massachusetts.JPG|100px]]\n| 105 Brattle Street,<br>[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]<br><small>{{Coord|42.376667|-71.126389|name=Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site}}</small>\n| July 15, 1775 to April 4, 1776\n| March 17 &ndash; [[Siege of Boston]] ends with the British evacuation<br>of nearly 10,000 troops.\n|- \n| [[Samuel Dexter House]]\n|\n| 699 High Street,<br>[[Dedham, Massachusetts]]<br><small>{{Coord|42.25015|-71.17792|name=Samuel Dexter House}}</small>\n| April 4 to 5, 1776\n| \"Expenses paid ...

Collection of the [[Museum of the American Revolution]], Philadelphia]]\nThe following is a list of buildings or locations that served as headquarters for General [[George Washington]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Background==\nOn April 19, 1775, the militia of Massachusetts &ndash; later joined by the militias of other New England colonies &ndash; began a [[Siege of Boston|siege at Boston]] to prevent thousands of newly-arrived British troops from moving inland.\n \nOn June 14, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] created a [[Continental Army]], to be formed out of the individual militias of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. The next day, Congress created the position of '''Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army''', and unanimously elected Washington to that position. Congress formally presented him with his commission on June 19, and he departed [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on June 23, headed for Massachusetts. He arrived at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], on July 2, and took command of the siege. It lasted until March 17, 1776, when the British withdrew by ship.\n\n[[Washington's Aides-de-Camp|Washington's headquarters staff]] consisted of a military secretary &ndash; initially, Colonel [[Joseph Reed (politician)|Joseph Reed]]; and four [[Aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] &ndash; initially, [[William Palfrey]], [[Stephen Moylan]], Richard Cary, and [[Robert Hanson Harrison]]. They managed Washington's correspondence, made copies of each day's General Orders (to be distributed to the commanding officer at each military post), and made copies of individual orders from the commander-in-chief.\n\nTraveling with the headquarters staff (his \"family\") and a troop of life-guards (bodyguards), Washington tended to stay at military camps, taverns, houses belonging to Continental Army officers or sympathetic civilians, and vacant houses seized from Loyalists. Topography and geographical features were exploited to protect a headquarters&mdash;before and after the [[Battle of Germantown]], Washington stayed at the Henry Keely House,<ref name=\"Keely\"/> atop a plateau on the west side of the [[Perkiomen Creek]], while the Continental Army camped on the east side of the creek at [[Pennypacker Mills]]; between Washington and the British Army.\n\nWashington's correspondence and expense accounts are useful sources for determining his location on a specific date. For instance: an expense account entry that lists meals &ndash; but not \"use of house\" &ndash; likely indicates that Washington and his staff [[George Washington's tent|pitched their tents]] on the owner's property.\n\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Headquarters==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"5%\"  | Image\n! width=\"20%\"  | Location/GPS Coordinates\n! width=\"15%\"  | Dates\n! width=\"45%\"  | Notes\n|-\n| [[Benjamin Wadsworth#Wadsworth House|Benjamin Wadsworth House]]<ref>[http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=32 Benjamin Wadsworth House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181637/http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=32 |date=2014-04-16 }} from Historic Buildings of Massachusetts.</ref>\n| [[File:Wadsworth House.JPG|100px]]\n| [[Harvard Yard]], 1341 Massachusetts Avenue,<br>[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]<br><small>{{Coord|42.373234|-71.1182814|name=Benjamin Wadsworth House}}</small> \n| July 2 to 15, 1775\n| First of Washington's Headquarters.<br>July 3 &ndash; Washington takes command of the Continental Army.\n|- \n| John Vassall House, ''also known as'' Longfellow House<br>&ndash;[[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site]]\n| [[File:Longfellow National Historic Site, Cambridge, Massachusetts.JPG|100px]]\n| 105 Brattle Street,<br>[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]<br><small>{{Coord|42.376667|-71.126389|name=Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site}}</small>\n| July 15, 1775 to April 4, 1776\n| March 17 &ndash; [[Siege of Boston]] ends with the British evacuation<br>of nearly 10,000 troops.\n|- \n| [[Samuel Dexter House]]\n|\n| 699 High Street,<br>[[Dedham, Massachusetts]]<br><small>{{Coord|42.25015|-71.17792|name=Samuel Dexter House}}</small>\n| April 4 to 5, 1776\n| \"Expenses paid ...
