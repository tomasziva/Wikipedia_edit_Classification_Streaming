Population of the region: {{Kz-census2009|2,059,200|punct=;}} {{Kz-census1999|1,557,269|punct=.}}\n\n==Geography==\nAlmaty Region surrounds the city of [[Almaty]]. The region borders [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Xinjiang]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The region also touches three other regions of Kazakhstan: [[Jambyl Region]] to the west, [[Karaganda Region]] to the northwest, and [[East Kazakhstan Region]] to the north. Almaty Region has an area of 224,000 square kilometres. \n\nMuch of the northwestern border of the region runs along  [[Lake Balkhash]], whose main affluent, the  [[Ili River]], is the most significant river of the region. In the region's northeast, it shares the four lakes of the Alakol Depression (Lakes [[Lake Alakol|Alakol]], [[Lake Sasykkol|Sasykkol]], Koshkarkol, and [[Zhalanashkol]]) with East Kazakhstan Region. Other lakes within the region include [[Bartogay Lake]] and [[Kapshagay]] lakes, [[Lake Issyk]], [[Kaindy lake|Kaindy]] and Kolsai lakes.\n\nThe [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] branch of the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan Mountains]] extends from China and Kyrgyzstan into Almaty Region, along its southern border with Kyrgyzstan. Farther to the northeast, the [[Dzungarian Alatau]] runs along the region's border with China.\nThe [[Charyn Canyon]] is one of the region's famous scenic spots.\nhttps://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/o-regione/\n\n==History==\n'''Alma-Ata Region''',  the predecessor of today's Almaty Region, was created from the historical region of [[Zhetysu]] on March 10, 1932. Its capital was Alma-Ata ([[Almaty]]). Several times during the Soviet period, the north-eastern part of the region, centered on [[Taldykorgan]], was separated from Alma-Ata Region, forming a separate '''Taldy-Kurgan Region''', only to be merged into Alma-Ata Region again several years later. \n\nIn April 2001 the administrative center of Almaty Region was moved from Almaty to Taldykorgan. Thus Taldykorgan has become a regional capital again - this time without splitting the region.\nAlmaty region was formed on March 10, 1932 with a center in the city of Almaty. The region included 18 districts.\nAt the end of 1939, part of the districts was transferred to the Dzhambul and Semipalatinsk regions, 23 districts remained in the Alma-Ata region, including the newly formed 7.\nIn March 1944, Taldy-Kurgan Region was allocated from its structure, to which 11 districts were transferred.\n\n==Heads of the region==\n# Baiken  Ashymov  1968\u20141970\n# Bimende Sadvokasov\t1970\u20141972\n# Aripbay  Alybaev 1972\u20141978\n# Sakan  Kussainov 1978\u20141982\n# Abubakir  Tynynybaev 1982\u20141986\n# Vladislav  Anufriev 1986\u20141988\n# Anatoly Zhigulin 1988\u20141990\n# Saginbek  Tursunov 1990\u20141993\n# Umirzak Uzbekov (1994-1996)\n# Serik  Ahimbekov 1996\u20141997\n# Zamanbek Nurkadilov (December 1997 - May 2001)\n# Shalbai Kulmakhanov (May 2001 - August 11, 2005)\n# Serik  Umbetov (2005-2011)\n# Anzar Musakhanov (from April 13, 2011 to August 20, 2014) \n# Amandyk Batalov (from August 20, 2014)\n\n\n==Awards==\nOn October 28, 1966, Alma-Ata region was awarded by Order of Lenin for its success in increasing the production and procurement of grain, meat, milk and other agricultural products.\nOn December 3, 1970, Alma-Ata region was awarded by the second Order of Lenin for the great successes achieved by the working people of the region in fulfilling the five-year plan for the development of industrial and agricultural production.\nhttps://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/o-regione/\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe region is administratively divided into sixteen districts and the cities of [[Kapchagay]], [[Taldykorgan]], and [[Tekeli, Kazakhstan|Tekeli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zhetysu.gov.kz/content-view-24.html|script-title=ru:\u0420\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438|publisher=The official portal of akimat of Almaty Region|language=Russian|accessdate=7 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923235246/http://zhetysu.gov.kz/content-view-24.html|archivedate=23 September 2013}}</ref>\n# [[Aksu District, Almaty Region|Aksu District]], with the administrative center in the settlement of [[Zhansugirov]];\n# [[Alakol District]], the town of [[Usharal]];\n# [[Balkhash District]], the [[Village#Central and Eastern Europe|selo]] of [[Bakanas]];\n# [[Enbekshikazakh District]], the town of [[Esik]];\n# [[Eskeldi District]], the settlement of [[Karabulak, Kazakhstan|Karabulak]];\n# [[Ile District, Kazakhstan|Ile District]], the settlement of [[Otegen Batyr]];\n# [[Karasay District]], the town of [[Kaskelen]];\n# [[Karatal District]], the town of [[Ushtobe]];\n# [[Kerbulak District]], the settlement of [[Sary-Ozek, Almaty Region|Saryozek]];\n# [[Koksu District]], the settlement of [[Balpyk Bi]];\n# [[Kegen District]], the settlement of [[Kegen]];\n# [[Panfilov District, Kazakhstan|Panfilov District]], the town of [[Zharkent]];\n# [[Raiymbek District]], the selo of [[Kegen]];\n# [[Sarkand District]], the town of [[Sarkand]];\n# [[Talgar District]], the town of [[Talgar]];\n# [[Uygur District]], the selo of [[Chundzha]];\n# [[Zhambyl District, Almaty Region|Zhambyl District]], the selo of [[Uzynagash]]\n# [[Taldykorgan]]\n# [[Kapchagay]]\n# [[Tekeli]]\n\n==Climate== \nThe natural conditions of the Almaty region include 5 climatic zones - from deserts to eternal snows.

At present, it is still multi-ethnic, however, Kazakhs absolutely prevail (72.07%), the share of Russians has greatly reduced to 13.33% of the region\u2019s inhabitants. The number of Uigurs is also significant (7.73%). The number of other Asian peoples - Turks, Kurds, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, as well as Koreans does not exceed 4% in total. The numerous communities of Germans, Greeks, Poles, Ukrainians, and other European peoples, who were once living in Kazakhstan during the Soviet era, significantly decreased due to mass emigration to other countries after 1991.\nhttps://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/o-regione/ \n\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the 1989 census (excepting Alma-Ata):\n*Kazakhs: 54.2%.\n*Russians: 28.6%. \n*Uigurs: 7.8%. \n*Others: 9.4%.\n\nIn the 1999 census (excepting Almaty):\n*Kazakhs: 66.4%. \n*Russians: 23.8%. \n*Uigurs: 7.0%.\n*Others: 4.6%.\n\nIn the 2009 census (excepting Almaty):\n*Kazakhs: 68.2%. \n*Russians: 22.8%. \n*Uigurs: 6.2%. \n*Other: 3.8%.\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:Tamgaly main petroglyph.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tamgaly main petroglyph]]\n*[[Besqaynar]] -

Population of the region: {{Kz-census2009|2,059,200|punct=;}} {{Kz-census1999|1,557,269|punct=.}}\n\n==Geography==\nAlmaty Region surrounds the city of [[Almaty]]. The region borders [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Xinjiang]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The region also touches three other regions of Kazakhstan: [[Jambyl Region]] to the west, [[Karaganda Region]] to the northwest, and [[East Kazakhstan Region]] to the north. Almaty Region has an area of 224,000 square kilometres. \n\nMuch of the northwestern border of the region runs along  [[Lake Balkhash]], whose main affluent, the  [[Ili River]], is the most significant river of the region. In the region's northeast, it shares the four lakes of the Alakol Depression (Lakes [[Lake Alakol|Alakol]], [[Lake Sasykkol|Sasykkol]], Koshkarkol, and [[Zhalanashkol]]) with East Kazakhstan Region. Other lakes within the region include [[Bartogay Lake]] and [[Kapshagay]] lakes, [[Lake Issyk]], [[Kaindy lake|Kaindy]] and Kolsai lakes.\n\nThe [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] branch of the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan Mountains]] extends from China and Kyrgyzstan into Almaty Region, along its southern border with Kyrgyzstan. Farther to the northeast, the [[Dzungarian Alatau]] runs along the region's border with China.\nThe [[Charyn Canyon]] is one of the region's famous scenic spots.\nhttps://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/o-regione/\n\n==History==\n'''Alma-Ata Region''',  the predecessor of today's Almaty Region, was created from the historical region of [[Zhetysu]] on March 10, 1932. Its capital was Alma-Ata ([[Almaty]]). Several times during the Soviet period, the north-eastern part of the region, centered on [[Taldykorgan]], was separated from Alma-Ata Region, forming a separate '''Taldy-Kurgan Region''', only to be merged into Alma-Ata Region again several years later. \n\nIn April 2001 the administrative center of Almaty Region was moved from Almaty to Taldykorgan. Thus Taldykorgan has become a regional capital again - this time without splitting the region.\nAlmaty region was formed on March 10, 1932 with a center in the city of Almaty. The region included 18 districts.\nAt the end of 1939, part of the districts was transferred to the Dzhambul and Semipalatinsk regions, 23 districts remained in the Alma-Ata region, including the newly formed 7.\nIn March 1944, Taldy-Kurgan Region was allocated from its structure, to which 11 districts were transferred.\n\n==Heads of the region==\n# Baiken  Ashymov  1968\u20141970\n# Bimende Sadvokasov\t1970\u20141972\n# Aripbay  Alybaev 1972\u20141978\n# Sakan  Kussainov 1978\u20141982\n# Abubakir  Tynynybaev 1982\u20141986\n# Vladislav  Anufriev 1986\u20141988\n# Anatoly Zhigulin 1988\u20141990\n# Saginbek  Tursunov 1990\u20141993\n# Umirzak Uzbekov (1994-1996)\n# Serik  Ahimbekov 1996\u20141997\n# Zamanbek Nurkadilov (December 1997 - May 2001)\n# Shalbai Kulmakhanov (May 2001 - August 11, 2005)\n# Serik  Umbetov (2005-2011)\n# Anzar Musakhanov (from April 13, 2011 to August 20, 2014) \n# Amandyk Batalov (from August 20, 2014)\n\n\n==Awards==\nOn October 28, 1966, Alma-Ata region was awarded by Order of Lenin for its success in increasing the production and procurement of grain, meat, milk and other agricultural products.\nOn December 3, 1970, Alma-Ata region was awarded by the second Order of Lenin for the great successes achieved by the working people of the region in fulfilling the five-year plan for the development of industrial and agricultural production.\nhttps://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/o-regione/\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe region is administratively divided into sixteen districts and the cities of [[Kapchagay]], [[Taldykorgan]], and [[Tekeli, Kazakhstan|Tekeli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zhetysu.gov.kz/content-view-24.html|script-title=ru:\u0420\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438|publisher=The official portal of akimat of Almaty Region|language=Russian|accessdate=7 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923235246/http://zhetysu.gov.kz/content-view-24.html|archivedate=23 September 2013}}</ref>\n# [[Aksu District, Almaty Region|Aksu District]], with the administrative center in the settlement of [[Zhansugirov]];\n# [[Alakol District]], the town of [[Usharal]];\n# [[Balkhash District]], the [[Village#Central and Eastern Europe|selo]] of [[Bakanas]];\n# [[Enbekshikazakh District]], the town of [[Esik]];\n# [[Eskeldi District]], the settlement of [[Karabulak, Kazakhstan|Karabulak]];\n# [[Ile District, Kazakhstan|Ile District]], the settlement of [[Otegen Batyr]];\n# [[Karasay District]], the town of [[Kaskelen]];\n# [[Karatal District]], the town of [[Ushtobe]];\n# [[Kerbulak District]], the settlement of [[Sary-Ozek, Almaty Region|Saryozek]];\n# [[Koksu District]], the settlement of [[Balpyk Bi]];\n# [[Kegen District]], the settlement of [[Kegen]];\n# [[Panfilov District, Kazakhstan|Panfilov District]], the town of [[Zharkent]];\n# [[Raiymbek District]], the selo of [[Kegen]];\n# [[Sarkand District]], the town of [[Sarkand]];\n# [[Talgar District]], the town of [[Talgar]];\n# [[Uygur District]], the selo of [[Chundzha]];\n# [[Zhambyl District, Almaty Region|Zhambyl District]], the selo of [[Uzynagash]]\n# [[Taldykorgan]]\n# [[Kapchagay]]\n# [[Tekeli]]\n\n==Climate== \nThe natural conditions of the Almaty region include 5 climatic zones - from deserts to eternal snows.

The number of Uigurs is also significant (7.73%). The number of other Asian peoples - Turks, Kurds, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, as well as Koreans does not exceed 4% in total. The numerous communities of Germans, Greeks, Poles, Ukrainians, and other European peoples, who were once living in Kazakhstan during the Soviet era, significantly decreased due to mass emigration to other countries after 1991.\nhttps://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/o-regione/ \n\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the 1989 census (excepting Alma-Ata):\n*Kazakhs: 54.2%.\n*Russians: 28.6%. \n*Uigurs: 7.8%. \n*Others: 9.4%.\n\nIn the 1999 census (excepting Almaty):\n*Kazakhs: 66.4%. \n*Russians: 23.8%. \n*Uigurs: 7.0%.\n*Others: 4.6%.\n\nIn the 2009 census (excepting Almaty):\n*Kazakhs: 68.2%. \n*Russians: 22.8%. \n*Uigurs: 6.2%. \n*Other: 3.8%.\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:Tamgaly main petroglyph.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tamgaly main petroglyph]]\n*[[Besqaynar]] - Ski resorts located 1500 metres above sea level\n*[[Tamgaly]] - a [[World Heritage Site]] ([[petroglyphs]])\n*[[Charyn Canyon]] - [[Charyn National Park]]\n*[[Talgar]] - a region where the [[Issyk kurgan]] is located\n*[[Medeo]] - one of the most famous [[ice rink]]s in the world\n*[[Dostyk]] - a point of entry from [[China]] to Kazakhstan\n*[[Kapchagay Dam]] on the [[Ili River]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Almaty Province}}\n*[http://zhetysu.gov.kz Official regional website]\n*Investment opportunities https://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/content/investitsionnye-vozmozhnosti-regiona/ \n\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Almaty Region\n|North     = [[East Kazakhstan Region]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Xinjiang]], {{flag|China}}\n|Southeast = \n|South     = {{flagicon image|Issyk kul obl flag.svg}} [[Issyk Kul Region]], {{flag|Kyrgyzstan}}\n|Southwest = {{flagicon image|Flag of Chuy Province.svg}} [[Chuy Region]], {{flag|Kyrgyzstan}}\n|West      = [[Jambyl Region]]\n|Northwest = [[Karaganda Region]]\n}}\n\n{{Almaty Region}}\n{{Regions of Kazakhstan}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Regions of Kazakhstan]]\n[[Category:Almaty Region| ]]\n", "name_user": "\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0448 \u0410\u0440\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaty_Region"}
