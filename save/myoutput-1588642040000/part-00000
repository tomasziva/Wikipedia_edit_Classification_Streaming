At the age of eighteen, Yangming had a talk with [[\u5a04\u8c05|Lou Liang]], who was one of the representative figures of [[Cheng\u2013Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu School]] at that time. Lou's teachings had significantly enhanced Yangming's interest in [[Cheng\u2013Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu School]]. After their conversations, Yangming managed to read through all of [[Zhu Xi|Zhu]]\u2019s work, reflecting on [[Cheng\u2013Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu School]]\u2019s principle that \u201cto acquire knowledge one must study things ([[:zh:\u683c\u7269\u81f4\u77e5|\u683c\u7269\u81f4\u77e5]]).\u201d To practice this principle, Yangming spent seven days doing nothing except staring at, or so to say, studying the bamboos planted in the garden.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Chiu_Yuan.jpg|thumb|199x199px|Lu Jiuyuan]]\nNot surprisingly, not only did he not learn anything from the bamboos, but Yangming also fell seriously ill after sitting in the garden for seven days.

He passed the exam and was later assigned to work in the construction department in the central government. In 1506, Yangming was caught in political conflicts, and soon was demoted to [[Guizhou]], the most deserted place in China at that time.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yangming soon recovered from the setback. While working on improving the living situations of people in Guizhou, Yangming developed his own philosophical principles, which were then called Yangminism, based on ''[[Great Learning|The Great Learning]]'' and [[Lu Jiuyuan|Lu]]\u2019s work.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Major Philosophy Principles ==\n\n=== \"The Supreme Principle is Buried in One's Mind\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Wang|first=Shouren|title=\u50b3\u7fd2\u9304|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> ===\nYangming inherits [[Lu Jiuyuan]]\u2019s idea that everything one needs can be found in one\u2019s heart, opposing to [[Cheng\u2013Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu]]\u2019s idea that one must learn from the external things. Yangming argues that there are countless matters existing in the world, we can never get to study all of, or even most of them. However, when we are interacting with the world, we are using our consciousness to look, smell, and hear what is all around us. Thus, we can find the existence of the whole world in our minds. If we think deeper, we can even see the extensions of the world there. The recognition of extensions here doesn't mean that one can see the whole picture of Eiffel Tower even he has never been to Paris. What Yangming has been trying to prove is that, as we have a completed set of perceptions of the world in our minds, we have as well gotten a hold of the ultimate philosophy, the truth of the world, the supreme principles which have been guiding and teaching us through the ages.\n\n=== Achieve the Ultimate Consciousness ===\n[[File:Wang_Shou-Ren_Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|439x439px|Yangming's handwriting]]\nIn his book, \u50b3\u7fd2\u9304, or I''nstructions for Practical Living and Other Neo-Confucian Writings'' in English, Yangming writes that \"there is nothing exists outside our minds, there is no supreme principle exists outside our hearts.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the problem here is that we let all kinds of selfish desires cover up the supreme principle, so we can't  practice the principle well in our daily lives. Yangming uses an example in his book to demonstrate his idea: if we see a child fall into water well, we can't help but feel bad for the child. The feeling of bad here is an embodiment of the inherent supreme principle in our minds. But, if the child happens to be the son of one's biggest enemy, he may not feel bad for the child after all. <ref name=\":2\" /> This is the situation in which the supreme principle is covered by selfish desires. If one can remove all selfish desires from one's heart, then he would achieve the ultimate consciousness, which is the final purpose pursed by many Chinese philosophers throughout centuries.\n\nOne thing worth noticing here is that, the ultimate consciousness is also in accordance with [[Cheng\u2013Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu]]'s \"to acquire knowledge one must study things ([[:zh:\u683c\u7269\u81f4\u77e5|\u683c\u7269\u81f4\u77e5]]\uff09\" in a way. This means that one must conduct appropriate behaviors under certain circumstances. For instance, everyone knows they should care about their families' wellbeing. But if one only asks whether his families are feeling good or bad and does nothing when he receives the answer \"feeling bad\", this cannot count as the ultimate consciousness. Only does one actually do things to take care of his families can be considered as knowing the ultimate consciousness.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The Unity of Inner Knowledge and Action ===\nThe unity of inner knowledge and action, or \"\u77e5\u884c\u5408\u4e00\", is probably the most important and well-known concept in Yangmingism. Yangming explains this concept as \u201cNobody can separate the knowledge and the action apart. If one knows, one will act. If one knows but don't act, then he has never actually known it. If you can obtain both, when you know something, you are already doing it; when you are doing something, then you already know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNowadays, many people treat knowledge and actions as two distinct things. They think the need to know first, only then can they do something in this area. This lead them to do nothing, as well as to know nothing.\u201d\n\nIn other words, \u77e5\u884c\u5408\u4e00 could be interpret as the consistency of one's Supreme Principle and his objective actions. In the example of a child falling into water well, the action is not trying to save the child, but \u201cfeeling bad for the child\u201d. And the knowledge, the part of the Supreme Principle used here is the sympathy for others. For those who doesn't feel bad for the child, they haven't learn the knowledge of sympathy yet, thus they cannot apply the knowledge in their actions.\n[[File:Great_philosopher_Wang_Shouren.jpg|thumb|272x272px|Wang Yangming]]\nSimilar ideas can be found in the western literature. In [[Demian]], [[Hermann Hesse]] writes that \"only the thoughts that we live out have any value.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hesse, Hermann.|title=Demian|date=2019|publisher=Dreamscape Media|isbn=978-1-9749-3912-1|oclc=1080083089}}</ref> [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s motto \"Mens et Manus,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mind_and_hand/|title=Mind and hand|website=MIT Admissions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> or \"Mind and Hand,\" also reflect the importance of combining the inner knowledge and actions as one.\n\n=== The Four-Sentence Teaching ===\nIn 1528, one year before his death, Yangming summaries his philosophies into a doctrine called \u201cthe Four-Sentence Teaching (\u56db\u53e5\u6559)\u201d. The original Chinese text is \u7121\u5584\u7121\u60e1\u5fc3\u4e4b\u9ad4\uff0c\u6709\u5584\u6709\u60e1\u610f\u4e4b\u52d5\uff1b\u77e5\u5584\u77e5\u60e1\u662f\u826f\u77e5\uff0c\u70ba\u5584\u53bb\u60e1\u662f\u683c\u7269.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kknews.cc/history/qemgk6r.html|title=\u738b\u967d\u660e\u300c\u56db\u53e5\u6559\u300d\u4e4b:\u77e5\u5584\u77e5\u60e1\u662f\u826f\u77e5\u3002|language=zh-tw|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> which can be translated as \u201cPeople\u2019s inward minds don't have the concept of good or bad. If one says he has good or bad in his mind, it is his intentions that moves. Knowing good and bad, as well as doing good and not doing bad, is know the good. Keep the good but remove the bad is rectifying.\u201c\n\n=== Education Philosophies ===\nYangming regards education as the most efficient way to inspire people to find the Supreme Principle in their minds; it means that not only do education institutions need to teach students academic knowledge, but they also need to teach students moral and ethical principles.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://gz.people.com.cn/BIG5/n2/2016/1030/c222152-29224811.html|title=\u5433\u5149\uff1a\u738b\u967d\u660e\u6559\u80b2\u601d\u60f3\u5167\u6db5\u6df1\u523b \u4e94\u9ede\u555f\u793a\u503c\u5f97\u601d\u8003\u3010\u5716\u3011--\u8cb4\u5dde\u983b\u9053--\u4eba\u6c11\u7db2|website=gz.people.com.cn|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> He again emphasized the necessity of uniting knowledge and actions as one in the process of education.<ref name=\":2\" /> Yangming believed that in order to achieve something, one must set up a specific goal first. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Genres ==\n[[File:Zhang_Juzheng.jpg|thumb|207x207px|Zhang Juzheng, one of the greatest Chinese politicians.]]\n\n=== Left Philosophical Genre ===\n\n==== Zhezhong School ====\nNotable figures in this genre include Nie Bao, [[Zhu Shouyin|Zou Shouyi]], [[Xu Jie (Ming dynasty)|Xu Jie]], and [[Zhang Juzheng]]. Zhezhong School emphasizes on inner virtues. Scholars in this school regard virtues and knowledge are the foundation of one's life, arguing that one should solely focus on learning instead of actively seeking fames or reputations. They emphasize the importance of education. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Right Philosophical Genre ===\n\n==== Taizhou School ====\nNotable figures include He Xinyin, Yan Shannong, and [[Wang Gen]]. Taizhou School became widespread because it focuses on the general public. Scholars in Taizhou School believe that even the most ordinary person has the possibility of accomplishing extraordinary achievements. Everyone is a potential saint, as the  universal truth is buried their own mind.<ref name=\":1\" /> Taizhou School is rebellious against both the traditional and the Neo-Confucianism.\n\n== Critics ==\nChinese historian and philosopher, [[Wang Fuzhi]], criticized that Yangming is more of a [[Buddhism|Buddism]] follower than a [[Neo-Confucianism]] philosopher. Yangming's excessive concentration on minds had made his teaching contain a negative attitude coming from his early education in [[Buddhism|Buddism]]. Wang didn't agree with Yangming that there is no good or bad exist in both the world and people's minds. He also argued that \u77e5\u884c\u5408\u4e00, the unity of inner knowledge and actions had made people can no longer separate theories and actual matter apart.\n\n== Yangmingism in Japan ==\n\u967d\u660e\u5b78, or '''\u3088\u3046\u3081\u3044\u304c\u304f''', is the branch of Yangmingism in Japan. Yangmingism was spread to Japan in the later periods of the Ming Dynasty by a traveling Japanese monk. From 1568 to 1603, Yangmingism was at its preliminary stage in Japan. Later, when [[Ming dynasty|the Ming Dynasty]] ended, some of the Ming scholars fled to Japan and helped to develop Yangmingism there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guoxue.com/?p=22247|title=\u300a\u65e5\u672c\u9633\u660e\u5b66\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u7cbe\u795e\u300b\uff1a\u8fe5\u5f02\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u9633\u660e\u5b66 \u2013 \u56fd\u5b66\u7f51|language=zh-CN|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> In 1789, Yangmingism became the dominant philosophy among [[bakufu]] governments in Japan.

If you can obtain both, when you know something, you are already doing it; when you are doing something, then you already know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNowadays, many people treat knowledge and actions as two distinct things. They think the need to know first, only then can they do something in this area. This lead them to do nothing, as well as to know nothing.\u201d\n\nIn other words, \u77e5\u884c\u5408\u4e00 could be interpret as the consistency of one's Supreme Principle and his objective actions. In the example of a child falling into water well, the action is not trying to save the child, but \u201cfeeling bad for the child\u201d. And the knowledge, the part of the Supreme Principle used here is the sympathy for others. For those who doesn't feel bad for the child, they haven't learn the knowledge of sympathy yet, thus they cannot apply the knowledge in their actions.\n[[File:Great_philosopher_Wang_Shouren.jpg|thumb|272x272px|Wang Yangming]]\nSimilar ideas can be found in the western literature. In [[Demian]], [[Hermann Hesse]] writes that \"only the thoughts that we live out have any value.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hesse, Hermann.|title=Demian|date=2019|publisher=Dreamscape Media|isbn=978-1-9749-3912-1|oclc=1080083089}}</ref> [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s motto \"Mens et Manus,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mind_and_hand/|title=Mind and hand|website=MIT Admissions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> or \"Mind and Hand,\" also reflect the importance of combining the inner knowledge and actions as one.\n\n=== The Four-Sentence Teaching ===\nIn 1528, one year before his death, Yangming summaries his philosophies into a doctrine called \u201cthe Four-Sentence Teaching (\u56db\u53e5\u6559)\u201d. The original Chinese text is \u7121\u5584\u7121\u60e1\u5fc3\u4e4b\u9ad4\uff0c\u6709\u5584\u6709\u60e1\u610f\u4e4b\u52d5\uff1b\u77e5\u5584\u77e5\u60e1\u662f\u826f\u77e5\uff0c\u70ba\u5584\u53bb\u60e1\u662f\u683c\u7269.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kknews.cc/history/qemgk6r.html|title=\u738b\u967d\u660e\u300c\u56db\u53e5\u6559\u300d\u4e4b:\u77e5\u5584\u77e5\u60e1\u662f\u826f\u77e5\u3002|language=zh-tw|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> which can be translated as \u201cPeople\u2019s inward minds don't have the concept of good or bad. If one says he has good or bad in his mind, it is his intentions that moves. Knowing good and bad, as well as doing good and not doing bad, is know the good. Keep the good but remove the bad is rectifying.\u201c\n\n=== Education Philosophies ===\nYangming regards education as the most efficient way to inspire people to find the Supreme Principle in their minds; it means that not only do education institutions need to teach students academic knowledge, but they also need to teach students moral and ethical principles.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://gz.people.com.cn/BIG5/n2/2016/1030/c222152-29224811.html|title=\u5433\u5149\uff1a\u738b\u967d\u660e\u6559\u80b2\u601d\u60f3\u5167\u6db5\u6df1\u523b\u00a0\u4e94\u9ede\u555f\u793a\u503c\u5f97\u601d\u8003\u3010\u5716\u3011--\u8cb4\u5dde\u983b\u9053--\u4eba\u6c11\u7db2|website=gz.people.com.cn|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> He again emphasized the necessity of uniting knowledge and actions as one in the process of education.<ref name=\":2\" /> Yangming believed that in order to achieve something, one must set up a specific goal first. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Genres ==\n[[File:Zhang_Juzheng.jpg|thumb|207x207px|Zhang Juzheng, one of the greatest Chinese politicians.]]\n\n=== Left Philosophical Genre ===\n\n==== Zhezhong School ====\nNotable figures in this genre include Nie Bao, [[Zhu Shouyin|Zou Shouyi]], [[Xu Jie (Ming dynasty)|Xu Jie]], and [[Zhang Juzheng]]. Zhezhong School emphasizes on inner virtues. Scholars in this school regard virtues and knowledge are the foundation of one's life, arguing that one should solely focus on learning instead of actively seeking fames or reputations. They emphasize the importance of education. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Right Philosophical Genre ===\n\n==== Taizhou School ====\nNotable figures include He Xinyin, Yan Shannong, and [[Wang Gen]]. Taizhou School became widespread because it focuses on the general public. Scholars in Taizhou School believe that even the most ordinary person has the possibility of accomplishing extraordinary achievements. Everyone is a potential saint, as the  universal truth is buried their own mind.<ref name=\":1\" /> Taizhou School is rebellious against both the traditional and the Neo-Confucianism.\n\n== Critics ==\nChinese historian and philosopher, [[Wang Fuzhi]], criticized that Yangming is more of a [[Buddhism|Buddism]] follower than a [[Neo-Confucianism]] philosopher. Yangming's excessive concentration on minds had made his teaching contain a negative attitude coming from his early education in [[Buddhism|Buddism]]. Wang didn't agree with Yangming that there is no good or bad exist in both the world and people's minds. He also argued that \u77e5\u884c\u5408\u4e00, the unity of inner knowledge and actions had made people can no longer separate theories and actual matter apart.\n\n== Yangmingism in Japan ==\n\u967d\u660e\u5b78, or '''\u3088\u3046\u3081\u3044\u304c\u304f''', is the branch of Yangmingism in Japan. Yangmingism was spread to Japan in the later periods of the Ming Dynasty by a traveling Japanese monk. From 1568 to 1603, Yangmingism was at its preliminary stage in Japan. Later, when [[Ming dynasty|the Ming Dynasty]] ended, some of the Ming scholars fled to Japan and helped to develop Yangmingism there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guoxue.com/?p=22247|title=\u300a\u65e5\u672c\u9633\u660e\u5b66\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u7cbe\u795e\u300b\uff1a\u8fe5\u5f02\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u9633\u660e\u5b66 \u2013 \u56fd\u5b66\u7f51|language=zh-CN|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> In 1789, Yangmingism became the dominant philosophy among [[bakufu]] governments in Japan.
