Kelly Fiveash of ''[[The Register]]'' said that this could mean \"a child's school life including exam results, attendance, teacher assessments and even characteristics\" could be available, with third-party organizations being responsible for anonymizing any publications themselves, rather than the data being anonymized by the government before being handed over. An example of a data request that Gove indicated had been rejected in the past, but might be possible under an improved version of privacy regulations, was for \"analysis on sexual exploitation\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/08/national_pupil_database_regulation_overhaul_in_private_sector_data_grab/|title=Psst: Heard the one about the National Pupil Database?

If criminals gain access to information such as a person's accounts or credit card numbers, that person could become the victim of [[fraud]] or [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases can reveal a great deal about that person's history, such as places he/she has visited, whom he/she has contacted with, products he/she has used, his/her activities and habits, or medications he/she has used. In some cases, corporations may use this information to target individuals with [[marketing]] customized towards those individual's personal preferences, which that person may or may not approve.\n\n===Internet===\n{{Main|Internet privacy}}\nThe ability to control the information one reveals about oneself over the internet, and who can access that information, has become a growing concern. These concerns include whether [[email]] can be stored or read by third parties without consent, or whether third parties can continue to track the websites that someone visited. Another concern is if websites one visited can collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about users.\n\nThe advent of various [[Web search engine|search engines]] and the use of [[data mining]] created a capability for data about individuals to be collected and combined from a wide variety of sources very easily.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2006-06-18-data-mining-privacy_x.htm|title=Research explores data mining, privacy|last=Bergstein|first=Brian|date=2006-06-18|work=USA Today|accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/154986_privacychallenge02.html|title=In this data-mining society, privacy advocates shudder|last=Bergstein|first=Brian|date=2004-01-01|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/21472572/u-s-demands-google-web-data|title=U.S. Demands Google Web Data|last=Swartz|first=Nikki|work=Information Management Journal|year=2006}} Vol. 40 Issue 3, p. 18</ref> The FTC has provided a set of guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practices in an electronic marketplace called the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].\n\nTo avoid giving away too much personal information, emails should be encrypted. Browsing of web pages as well as other online activities should be done trace-less via \"anonymizers\", in case those are not trusted, by open-source distributed anonymizers, so called [[mix net]]s, such as [[I2P]] or [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor \u2013 The Onion Router]]. VPNs ([[Virtual private network|Virtual Private Networks]]) are another \"anonymizer\" that can be used to give someone more protection while online. This includes obfuscating and encrypting web traffic so that other groups cannot see or mine it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vyprvpn.com/why-vpn/protect-privacy-and-security|title=VyprVPN Protects Your Privacy and Security {{!}} Golden Frog|website=www.vyprvpn.com|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> \n\nEmail isn't the only internet content with privacy concerns. In an age where increasing amounts of information is online, social networking sites pose additional privacy challenges. People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or unexpectedly by others. Data about location can also be accidentally published, for example, when someone posts a picture with a store as a background. Caution should be exercised when posting information online, social networks vary in what they allow users to make private and what remains publicly accessible.<ref name=\"SchneiderTheInter08\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E1fQdrzxAPoC&pg=PA17-IA137|title=The Internet: Illustrated Series|author=Schneider, G.|author2=Evans, J.|author3=Pinard, K.T.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423999386|page=156|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> Without strong security settings in place and careful attention to what remains public, a person can be profiled by searching for and collecting disparate pieces of information, worst case leading to cases of [[cyberstalking]]<ref name=\"BocijCyber04\">{{cite book|title=Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family|author=Bocij, P.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|isbn=9780275981181|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cyberstalkinghar00boci/page/268 268]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cyberstalkinghar00boci/page/268}}</ref> or reputation damage.<ref name=\"CannataciPrivacy16\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGC_DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|title=Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age|author=Cannataci, J.A.|author2=Zhao, B.|author3=Vives, G.T.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=9789231001888|page=26|display-authors=etal|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Locational===\nAs location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are advancing ([[location-based service]]s), problems related to user privacy arise.

Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues. Data privacy issues may arise in response to information from a wide range of sources, such as:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Programme Management Managing Multiple Projects Successfully.|date=2009|publisher=Global India Pubns|others=Mittal, Prashant.|isbn=978-9380228204|oclc=464584332}}</ref>\n* [[Healthcare]] records\n* [[Criminal justice]] investigations and proceedings\n* [[Financial]] institutions and transactions\n* [[Biological]] traits, such as [[genetic material]]\n* [[house|Residence]] and geographic records\n* [[Privacy breach]]\n* [[Location-based service]] and [[geolocation]]\n* [[Behavioral Targeting|Web surfing behavior]] or user preferences using [[persistent cookie]]s\n* [[Academic research]]\n\n==Protection of privacy in information systems==\nAs heterogeneous information systems with differing privacy rules are interconnected and information is shared, [[policy appliances]] will be required to reconcile, enforce, and monitor an increasing amount of privacy policy rules (and laws). There are two categories of technology to address privacy protection in [[Commerce|commercial]] IT systems: communication and enforcement.\n\n;Policy communication\n\n*[[P3P]] \u2013 The Platform for Privacy Preferences. P3P is a standard for communicating privacy practices and comparing them to the preferences of individuals.\n\n;Policy enforcement\n\n*[[XACML]] \u2013 The Extensible Access Control Markup Language together with its Privacy Profile is a standard for expressing privacy policies in a machine-readable language which a software system can use to enforce the policy in enterprise IT systems.\n*[[Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language|EPAL]] \u2013 The Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language is very similar to XACML, but is not yet a standard.\n* WS-Privacy - \"Web Service Privacy\" will be a specification for communicating privacy policy in [[web service]]s. For example, it may specify how privacy policy information can be embedded in the [[SOAP]] envelope of a web service message.\n\n;Protecting privacy on the internet\n\nOn the internet many users give away a lot of information about themselves: unencrypted e-mails can be read by the administrators of an [[e-mail server]], if the connection is not encrypted (no [[HTTPS]]), and also the [[internet service provider]] and other parties [[packet analyzer|sniffing]] the network traffic of that connection are able to know the contents.\nThe same applies to any kind of traffic generated on the Internet, including [[web browsing]], [[instant messenger|instant messaging]], and others.\nIn order not to give away too much personal information, e-mails can be encrypted and browsing of webpages as well as other online activities can be done traceless via [[anonymizer]]s, or by open source distributed anonymizers, so-called [[mix network]]s.\nWell known open-source mix nets include [[I2P|I2P \u2013 The Anonymous Network]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].\n\n;Improving privacy through individualization\n\nComputer privacy can be improved through [[forensic identification|individualization]]. Currently security messages are designed for the \"average user\", i.e. the same message for everyone. Researchers have posited that individualized messages and security \"nudges\", crafted based on users' individual differences and personality traits, can be used for further improvements for each person's compliance with computer security and privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blues.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/2015/08/26/the-myth-of-the-average-user-improving-privacy-and-security-systems-through-individualization-nspw-15/|title=The Myth of the Average User: Improving Privacy and Security Systems through Individualization (NSPW '15) {{!}} BLUES|website=blues.cs.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n\n==United States Safe Harbor program and passenger name record issues==\nThe [[United States Department of Commerce]] created the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] certification program in response to the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|1995 Directive on Data Protection]] (Directive 95/46/EC) of the European Commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm |title=Protection of personal data |publisher=[[European Commission]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616181201/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm |date= |archivedate=16 June 2006 |accessdate= }}</ref> Directive 95/46/EC declares in Chapter IV Article 25 that personal data may only be transferred from the countries in the [[European Economic Area]] to countries which provide [[adequate]] privacy protection. Historically, establishing adequacy required the creation of national laws broadly equivalent to those implemented by Directive 95/46/EU. Although there are exceptions to this blanket prohibition \u2013 for example where the disclosure to a country outside the EEA is made with the consent of the relevant individual (Article 26(1)(a)) \u2013 they are limited in practical scope. As a result, Article 25 created a legal risk to organisations which transfer personal data from Europe to the United States.\n\nThe program regulates the exchange of [[passenger name record]] information between the EU and the US. According to the EU directive, personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller himself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.\n\nThe [[European Commission]] has set up the \"Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data,\" commonly known as the \"Article 29 Working Party\". The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.\n\nThe Working Party negotiated with U.S. representatives about the protection of personal data, the [[Safe Harbor Principles]] were the result. Notwithstanding that approval, the self-assessment approach of the Safe Harbor remains controversial with a number of European privacy regulators and commentators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf |title=SEC (2004) 1323: The implementation of Commission Decision 520/2000/EC on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Safe Harbour privacy Principles and related Frequently Asked Questions issued by the US Department of Commerce |publisher=[[European Commission]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724173657/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf |date=20 October 2004 |archivedate=24 July 2006 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe Safe Harbor program addresses this issue in the following way: rather than a blanket law imposed on all organisations in the [[United States]], a voluntary program is enforced by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. U.S. organisations which register with this program, having self-assessed their compliance with a number of standards, are \"deemed adequate\" for the purposes of Article 25. Personal information can be sent to such organisations from the EEA without the sender being in breach of Article 25 or its EU national equivalents. The Safe Harbor was approved as providing adequate protection for personal data, for the purposes of Article 25(6), by the European Commission on 26 July 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0520:EN:HTML |title=2000/520/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce |work=[[Official Journal of the European Union]], L Series |volume=215 |pages=7\u201347 |via=[[Eur-Lex]] |date=25 August 2000 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nUnder the Safe Harbor, adoptee organisations need to carefully consider their compliance with the ''onward transfer obligations'', where personal data originating in the EU is transferred to the US Safe Harbor, and then onward to a third country. The alternative compliance approach of \"[[binding corporate rules]]\", recommended by many EU privacy regulators, resolves this issue. In addition, any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of HR data to the US Safe Harbor must be heard by a panel of EU privacy regulators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/information_safe_harbour_en.pdf |title=Q&A on the European Data Protection Authorities Panel foreseen by the Safe Harbour Decision |publisher=[[European Commission]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724174212/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/information_safe_harbour_en.pdf |date= |archivedate= |accessdate= |archive-date=2006-07-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, a new, controversial,<ref name=R89 /> [[Passenger Name Record]] agreement between the US and the EU was made.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120112021643/http://www.libertysecurity.org/article1591.html</ref><!--NOTE: Archive-only.

For example, third parties can track IP TV programs someone has watched at any given time. \"The addition of any information in a broadcasting stream is not required for an audience rating survey, additional devices are not requested to be installed in the houses of viewers or listeners, and without the necessity of their cooperations, audience ratings can be automatically performed in real-time.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2010/0011389.html | work=FreePatentsOnline.com | title=System for Gathering TV Audience Rating in Real Time in Internet Protocol Television Network and Method Thereof| date=2010-01-14 | accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref>\n\n===Educational===\nIn the United Kingdom in 2012, the Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] described the [[National Pupil Database]] as a \"rich dataset\" whose value could be \"maximised\" by making it more openly accessible, including to private companies. Kelly Fiveash of ''[[The Register]]'' said that this could mean \"a child's school life including exam results, attendance, teacher assessments and even characteristics\" could be available, with third-party organizations being responsible for anonymizing any publications themselves, rather than the data being anonymized by the government before being handed over. An example of a data request that Gove indicated had been rejected in the past, but might be possible under an improved version of privacy regulations, was for \"analysis on sexual exploitation\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/08/national_pupil_database_regulation_overhaul_in_private_sector_data_grab/|title=Psst: Heard the one about the National Pupil Database?

If criminals gain access to information such as a person's accounts or credit card numbers, that person could become the victim of [[fraud]] or [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases can reveal a great deal about that person's history, such as places he/she has visited, whom he/she has contacted with, products he/she has used, his/her activities and habits, or medications he/she has used. In some cases, corporations may use this information to target individuals with [[marketing]] customized towards those individual's personal preferences, which that person may or may not approve.\n\n===Internet===\n{{Main|Internet privacy}}\nThe ability to control the information one reveals about oneself over the internet, and who can access that information, has become a growing concern. These concerns include whether [[email]] can be stored or read by third parties without consent, or whether third parties can continue to track the websites that someone visited. Another concern is if websites one visited can collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about users.\n\nThe advent of various [[Web search engine|search engines]] and the use of [[data mining]] created a capability for data about individuals to be collected and combined from a wide variety of sources very easily.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2006-06-18-data-mining-privacy_x.htm|title=Research explores data mining, privacy|last=Bergstein|first=Brian|date=2006-06-18|work=USA Today|accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/154986_privacychallenge02.html|title=In this data-mining society, privacy advocates shudder|last=Bergstein|first=Brian|date=2004-01-01|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/21472572/u-s-demands-google-web-data|title=U.S. Demands Google Web Data|last=Swartz|first=Nikki|work=Information Management Journal|year=2006}} Vol. 40 Issue 3, p. 18</ref> The FTC has provided a set of guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practices in an electronic marketplace called the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].\n\nTo avoid giving away too much personal information, emails should be encrypted. Browsing of web pages as well as other online activities should be done trace-less via \"anonymizers\", in case those are not trusted, by open-source distributed anonymizers, so called [[mix net]]s, such as [[I2P]] or [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor \u2013 The Onion Router]]. VPNs ([[Virtual private network|Virtual Private Networks]]) are another \"anonymizer\" that can be used to give someone more protection while online. This includes obfuscating and encrypting web traffic so that other groups cannot see or mine it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vyprvpn.com/why-vpn/protect-privacy-and-security|title=VyprVPN Protects Your Privacy and Security {{!}} Golden Frog|website=www.vyprvpn.com|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> \n\nEmail isn't the only internet content with privacy concerns. In an age where increasing amounts of information is online, social networking sites pose additional privacy challenges. People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or unexpectedly by others. Data about location can also be accidentally published, for example, when someone posts a picture with a store as a background. Caution should be exercised when posting information online, social networks vary in what they allow users to make private and what remains publicly accessible.<ref name=\"SchneiderTheInter08\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E1fQdrzxAPoC&pg=PA17-IA137|title=The Internet: Illustrated Series|author=Schneider, G.|author2=Evans, J.|author3=Pinard, K.T.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423999386|page=156|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> Without strong security settings in place and careful attention to what remains public, a person can be profiled by searching for and collecting disparate pieces of information, worst case leading to cases of [[cyberstalking]]<ref name=\"BocijCyber04\">{{cite book|title=Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family|author=Bocij, P.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|isbn=9780275981181|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cyberstalkinghar00boci/page/268 268]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cyberstalkinghar00boci/page/268}}</ref> or reputation damage.<ref name=\"CannataciPrivacy16\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGC_DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|title=Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age|author=Cannataci, J.A.|author2=Zhao, B.|author3=Vives, G.T.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=9789231001888|page=26|display-authors=etal|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Locational===\nAs location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are advancing ([[location-based service]]s), problems related to user privacy arise.

This may be because they have concern that it might affect their insurance coverages or employment.

Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues. Data privacy issues may arise in response to information from a wide range of sources, such as:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Programme Management Managing Multiple Projects Successfully.|date=2009|publisher=Global India Pubns|others=Mittal, Prashant.|isbn=978-9380228204|oclc=464584332}}</ref>\n* [[Healthcare]] records\n* [[Criminal justice]] investigations and proceedings\n* [[Financial]] institutions and transactions\n* [[Biological]] traits, such as [[genetic material]]\n* [[house|Residence]] and geographic records\n* [[Privacy breach]]\n* [[Location-based service]] and [[geolocation]]\n* [[Behavioral Targeting|Web surfing behavior]] or user preferences using [[persistent cookie]]s\n* [[Academic research]]\n\n==Protection of privacy in information systems==\nAs heterogeneous information systems with differing privacy rules are interconnected and information is shared, [[policy appliances]] will be required to reconcile, enforce, and monitor an increasing amount of privacy policy rules (and laws). There are two categories of technology to address privacy protection in [[Commerce|commercial]] IT systems: communication and enforcement.\n\n;Policy communication\n\n*[[P3P]] \u2013 The Platform for Privacy Preferences. P3P is a standard for communicating privacy practices and comparing them to the preferences of individuals.\n\n;Policy enforcement\n\n*[[XACML]] \u2013 The Extensible Access Control Markup Language together with its Privacy Profile is a standard for expressing privacy policies in a machine-readable language which a software system can use to enforce the policy in enterprise IT systems.\n*[[Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language|EPAL]] \u2013 The Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language is very similar to XACML, but is not yet a standard.\n* WS-Privacy - \"Web Service Privacy\" will be a specification for communicating privacy policy in [[web service]]s. For example, it may specify how privacy policy information can be embedded in the [[SOAP]] envelope of a web service message.\n\n;Protecting privacy on the internet\n\nOn the internet many users give away a lot of information about themselves: unencrypted e-mails can be read by the administrators of an [[e-mail server]], if the connection is not encrypted (no [[HTTPS]]), and also the [[internet service provider]] and other parties [[packet analyzer|sniffing]] the network traffic of that connection are able to know the contents.\nThe same applies to any kind of traffic generated on the Internet, including [[web browsing]], [[instant messenger|instant messaging]], and others.\nIn order not to give away too much personal information, e-mails can be encrypted and browsing of webpages as well as other online activities can be done traceless via [[anonymizer]]s, or by open source distributed anonymizers, so-called [[mix network]]s.\nWell known open-source mix nets include [[I2P|I2P \u2013 The Anonymous Network]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].\n\n;Improving privacy through individualization\n\nComputer privacy can be improved through [[forensic identification|individualization]]. Currently security messages are designed for the \"average user\", i.e. the same message for everyone. Researchers have posited that individualized messages and security \"nudges\", crafted based on users' individual differences and personality traits, can be used for further improvements for each person's compliance with computer security and privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blues.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/2015/08/26/the-myth-of-the-average-user-improving-privacy-and-security-systems-through-individualization-nspw-15/|title=The Myth of the Average User: Improving Privacy and Security Systems through Individualization (NSPW '15) {{!}} BLUES|website=blues.cs.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n\n==United States Safe Harbor program and passenger name record issues==\nThe [[United States Department of Commerce]] created the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] certification program in response to the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|1995 Directive on Data Protection]] (Directive 95/46/EC) of the European Commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm |title=Protection of personal data |publisher=[[European Commission]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616181201/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm |date= |archivedate=16 June 2006 |accessdate= }}</ref> Directive 95/46/EC declares in Chapter IV Article 25 that personal data may only be transferred from the countries in the [[European Economic Area]] to countries which provide [[adequate]] privacy protection. Historically, establishing adequacy required the creation of national laws broadly equivalent to those implemented by Directive 95/46/EU. Although there are exceptions to this blanket prohibition \u2013 for example where the disclosure to a country outside the EEA is made with the consent of the relevant individual (Article 26(1)(a)) \u2013 they are limited in practical scope. As a result, Article 25 created a legal risk to organisations which transfer personal data from Europe to the United States.\n\nThe program regulates the exchange of [[passenger name record]] information between the EU and the US. According to the EU directive, personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller himself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.\n\nThe [[European Commission]] has set up the \"Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data,\" commonly known as the \"Article 29 Working Party\". The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.\n\nThe Working Party negotiated with U.S. representatives about the protection of personal data, the [[Safe Harbor Principles]] were the result. Notwithstanding that approval, the self-assessment approach of the Safe Harbor remains controversial with a number of European privacy regulators and commentators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf |title=SEC (2004) 1323: The implementation of Commission Decision 520/2000/EC on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Safe Harbour privacy Principles and related Frequently Asked Questions issued by the US Department of Commerce |publisher=[[European Commission]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724173657/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf |date=20 October 2004 |archivedate=24 July 2006 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe Safe Harbor program addresses this issue in the following way: rather than a blanket law imposed on all organisations in the [[United States]], a voluntary program is enforced by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. U.S. organisations which register with this program, having self-assessed their compliance with a number of standards, are \"deemed adequate\" for the purposes of Article 25. Personal information can be sent to such organisations from the EEA without the sender being in breach of Article 25 or its EU national equivalents. The Safe Harbor was approved as providing adequate protection for personal data, for the purposes of Article 25(6), by the European Commission on 26 July 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0520:EN:HTML |title=2000/520/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce |work=[[Official Journal of the European Union]], L Series |volume=215 |pages=7\u201347 |via=[[Eur-Lex]] |date=25 August 2000 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nUnder the Safe Harbor, adoptee organisations need to carefully consider their compliance with the ''onward transfer obligations'', where personal data originating in the EU is transferred to the US Safe Harbor, and then onward to a third country. The alternative compliance approach of \"[[binding corporate rules]]\", recommended by many EU privacy regulators, resolves this issue. In addition, any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of HR data to the US Safe Harbor must be heard by a panel of EU privacy regulators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/information_safe_harbour_en.pdf |title=Q&A on the European Data Protection Authorities Panel foreseen by the Safe Harbour Decision |publisher=[[European Commission]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724174212/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/information_safe_harbour_en.pdf |date= |archivedate= |accessdate= |archive-date=2006-07-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, a new, controversial,<ref name=R89 /> [[Passenger Name Record]] agreement between the US and the EU was made.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120112021643/http://www.libertysecurity.org/article1591.html</ref><!--NOTE: Archive-only.
