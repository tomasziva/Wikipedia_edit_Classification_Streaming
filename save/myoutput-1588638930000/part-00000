It is the standalone successor of the [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] of [[DayZ (mod)|the same name]]. Following a five-year long [[early access]] period for Windows, the game was officially released in December 2018, and was released for the [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in 2019.\n\nThe game places the player in the fictional [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet Republic]] of Chernarus, where a mysterious plague has turned most of the population into violent \"infected\". As a survivor, the player must scavenge the world for food, water, weapons, and medicine, while killing or avoiding the infected, and killing, avoiding, or cooperating with other players in an effort to survive the [[outbreak]].\n\n''DayZ'' began development in 2012 when the mod's creator, [[Dean Hall (game designer)|Dean Hall]], joined Bohemia Interactive to commence work on the standalone version of the game. The development has been focused on altering the engine to suit the game's needs, developing a working [[Client\u2013server model|client-server architecture]], and introducing new features like diseases and a better inventory system. The game sold over three million copies during its early access phase.\nThis is a great game for kids though.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe goal of ''DayZ'' is to stay alive and healthy during the conditions of the [[zombie outbreak]] that have befallen the in-game world. The player begins equipped with only simple clothes, a road flare and a rag, and must begin exploring the large 225&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> landscape of the fictional former Soviet Republic of Chernarus to investigate locations such as houses, barns, and apartments to scavenge supplies.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/05/30/buy-a-paper-map-of-day-zs-horrifying-world-chernarus-for-15/| title = Buy a paper map of Day Z\u2019s horrifying world, Chernarus| date = May 30, 2012| accessdate =  April 5, 2013 |publisher= [[Future plc]] |work= [[PC Gamer]] |first= Evan |last= Lahti}}</ref><ref name=\"Devblogvid3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/12/25/diary-one-hour-in-dayzs-christmas-ceasefire/ |title= Diary: one hour in DayZ's Christmas ceasefire |date= December 25, 2013 |accessdate= December 26, 2013 |first= Tom |last= Senior |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> These supplies include food and water, which are basic keys to prolonging the player's life.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/games/DayZ-Standalone-Alpha-Newbie-Guide-61173.html |title= DayZ Standalone Alpha: The Newbie Guide |date= December 20, 2013 |accessdate= December 20, 2013 |first= Pete |last= Haas |work= Cinema Blend}}</ref><ref name=\"iDT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/articles/21300/20131229/dayz-standalone-first-impressions-seven-hours-chernarus.htm |title=DayZ Standalone First Impressions: Seven Hours In Chernarus And I'm Hooked |date=December 29, 2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |first=Scott |last=Craft |work=International Digital Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232036/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/articles/21300/20131229/dayz-standalone-first-impressions-seven-hours-chernarus.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2013  }}</ref> Beyond the basics of survival, players can find various forms of clothing, which not only allow them to customize their charactes, but can bring the benefit of extra storage space for supplies and warmth.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/games/DayZ-Standalone-Now-Available-61093.html |title= DayZ Standalone Now Available |date= December 16, 2013 |accessdate= December 18, 2013 |first= William |last= Usher |work= Cinema Blend}}</ref> Also scattered around the map are a variety of weapons, allowing players to protect themselves from [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]] and other players, if necessary.

Following a five-year long [[early access]] period for Windows, the game was officially released in December 2018, and was released for the [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in 2019.\n\nThe game places the player in the fictional [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet Republic]] of Chernarus, where a mysterious plague has turned most of the population into violent \"infected\". As a survivor, the player must scavenge the world for food, water, weapons, and medicine, while killing or avoiding the infected, and killing, avoiding, or cooperating with other players in an effort to survive the [[outbreak]].\n\n''DayZ'' began development in 2012 when the mod's creator, [[Dean Hall (game designer)|Dean Hall]], joined Bohemia Interactive to commence work on the standalone version of the game. The development has been focused on altering the engine to suit the game's needs, developing a working [[Client\u2013server model|client-server architecture]], and introducing new features like diseases and a better inventory system. The game sold over three million copies during its early access phase.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe goal of ''DayZ'' is to stay alive and healthy during the conditions of the [[zombie outbreak]] that have befallen the in-game world. The player begins equipped with only simple clothes, a road flare and a rag, and must begin exploring the large 225&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> landscape of the fictional former Soviet Republic of Chernarus to investigate locations such as houses, barns, and apartments to scavenge supplies.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/05/30/buy-a-paper-map-of-day-zs-horrifying-world-chernarus-for-15/| title = Buy a paper map of Day Z\u2019s horrifying world, Chernarus| date = May 30, 2012| accessdate =  April 5, 2013 |publisher= [[Future plc]] |work= [[PC Gamer]] |first= Evan |last= Lahti}}</ref><ref name=\"Devblogvid3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/12/25/diary-one-hour-in-dayzs-christmas-ceasefire/ |title= Diary: one hour in DayZ's Christmas ceasefire |date= December 25, 2013 |accessdate= December 26, 2013 |first= Tom |last= Senior |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> These supplies include food and water, which are basic keys to prolonging the player's life.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/games/DayZ-Standalone-Alpha-Newbie-Guide-61173.html |title= DayZ Standalone Alpha: The Newbie Guide |date= December 20, 2013 |accessdate= December 20, 2013 |first= Pete |last= Haas |work= Cinema Blend}}</ref><ref name=\"iDT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/articles/21300/20131229/dayz-standalone-first-impressions-seven-hours-chernarus.htm |title=DayZ Standalone First Impressions: Seven Hours In Chernarus And I'm Hooked |date=December 29, 2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |first=Scott |last=Craft |work=International Digital Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232036/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/articles/21300/20131229/dayz-standalone-first-impressions-seven-hours-chernarus.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2013  }}</ref> Beyond the basics of survival, players can find various forms of clothing, which not only allow them to customize their charactes, but can bring the benefit of extra storage space for supplies and warmth.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/games/DayZ-Standalone-Now-Available-61093.html |title= DayZ Standalone Now Available |date= December 16, 2013 |accessdate= December 18, 2013 |first= William |last= Usher |work= Cinema Blend}}</ref> Also scattered around the map are a variety of weapons, allowing players to protect themselves from [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]] and other players, if necessary.
