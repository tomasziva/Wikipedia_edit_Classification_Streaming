The [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] was activated in October 1943 .  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]] and participated in the [[strategic bombing in World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign]] against Germany from 31 May 1944 to 20 April 1945, losing 22 aircraft while flying more than 5,000 sorties.  Following [[V-E Day]], the group returned to the United States, where it was inactivated in November 1945.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n{{Commons category-inline|490th Bombardment Group (United States Army Air Forces)|490th Bombardment Group}}\n[[File:490th Bombardment Group - B-24 Liberator 42-94837.jpg|thumb|490th Bombardment Group B-24 Liberator]]\nThe '''490th Bombardment Group''' was activated at [[Salt Lake City Army Air Base]], Utah on 1 October 1943, with four squadrons, the [[848th Strategic Missile Squadron|848th]], [[849th Strategic Missile Squadron|849th]], [[850th Strategic Missile Squadron|850th]] and [[851st Bombardment Squadron]]s assigned.
