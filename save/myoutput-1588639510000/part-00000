wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nThe town lies on the banks of the [[Suage River]], {{convert|30|km}} north from [[Iloilo City]]. The town has an area of 94&nbsp;km\u00b2, 85% of which is agricultural land. In December 1997, it was declared as the \"Christmas Capital of [[Western Visayas]]\"{{by whom|date=February 2016}} because of its famed Christmas Festival of Lights.\n\nConsidered{{by whom|date=February 2016}} the rice granary of [[Panay]], the town is bordered by [[Dingle, Iloilo|Dingle]] to the north, [[Zarraga, Iloilo|Zarraga]] to the south, [[Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo|Barotac Nuevo]] to the east,  [[New Lucena, Iloilo]] and [[Mina, Iloilo|Mina]] to the west.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe first people of Pototan were the family of Datu Ramon, grandson of Datu Puti, a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] from the town of Dumangas.{{dubious|date=February 2016}} They first settled at Barangay Naslo, which was formerly the [[poblacion]] (town center). In that place was found a luxuriant growth of trees called ''\"putat\"'', after which the place was subsequently called ''\"Kaputatan\"'' or \"place of many Putat trees.\" However, due to its hilly terrain and poor water supply, they decided to move nearer the bank of the [[Suage River]], now called Pototan.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century, the [[China|Chinese]] traders arrived in Pototan.\n\n===Spanish era===\n[[File:Pototan - St. Joseph's Parish - Facade.JPG|thumb|St. Joseph's Church]]\nThe arrival of the [[Spain|Spaniards]] in 1593 sparked new changes in the socio-economic and political life of the natives. It was the start of a new era, the natives were converted to [[Catholicism]] through the efforts of [[Augustinian Friars]]. The settlement was subsequently made into a Parish. Education, though at the onset only for the privileged few, was introduced. The name ''\"Kaputatan\"'', which the Spanish have difficulty pronouncing, was changed to ''\"Pototan\"''.\n\nThe Spanish built roads and bridges.  Don Tomas Sajen and Don Escribano supervised the construction of the Tribunal (municipal hall) with the natives contributing the labor. The Tribunal withstood [[World War II]] and in the early 50s was modified into what is now the Western Visayas Hospital.\n\nIn 1874, Pototanons began to run their own political affairs with the appointment of Don Juan Marcelo as the first [[Capitan Municipal]]. This form of government continued until the arrival of the Americans.\n\nDuring the incumbency of Capitan Municipal Braulio Pe\u00f1aranda in 1891, there was a [[cholera]] outbreak.\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], Pototanons such as [[Teresa Magbanua]] (known as the Joan of arc of the Visayas{{Cook, Bernard A. (2006). Women and War: A Historical Encyclopedia from Antiquity to the Present. ABC-CLIO. p. 465. ISBN 978-1-85109-770-8.}}) and her two brothers, [[Elias Magbanua|Elias]] and [[Pascual Magbanua]] took up arms and joined the revolution.\n\nThe Americans arrived after Spain ceded Philippines to the [[United States]] in 1898. The remaining Spanish population fled to the hills together with many Filipinos including the last Gobernadorcillio, Don [[Maurillo Mendoza]]. He was later held prisoner by the Americans but subsequently named the first Municipal President.\n\n===American era===\nUnder the Americans, the natives were granted the freedom of speech and worship. Education was liberalized; more and better roads and bridges were constructed. Improvements were also noticed in the economic, social and cultural life of the people.\n\nDuring the incumbency of Mun. President [[Maurillo Mendoza]], the Pototanons again witnessed another unforgettable event: the burning of the entire half of the poblacion in November 1914. The cause of the fire is unknown.\n\nWhen the [[Philippine Constitution]] was ratified in 1935, another change in the town's local governance was introduced: the title of Municipal President was changed to Municipal Mayor. [[Santiago Puig]] was the first Municipal Mayor. He was succeeded by Mariano Pe\u00f1aflorida in 1940. Pe\u00f1aflorida served until September 16, 1942.\n\n===World War II===\nThe coming of the [[Japan]]ese during [[World War II]] spread chaos and fear among Pototanons. Mayor Pe\u00f1aflorida continued to act as Mayor under the Free Revolutionary Government of [[Tomas Confesor]] while the Japanese Imperial Forces designated [[Tomas Ferrariz]] as Puppet Mayor.\n\nOn 1945, during the Battle for the Liberation of Iloilo the combined Filipino and American troops together with the Ilonggo guerillas invaded the town of Pototan, Iloilo. The Liberation force included Allied Filipino soldiers of the 6th, 61st and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 6th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, They continued to combat the Japanese Imperial forces until the end of [[World War II]].\n\n==Barangays==\nPototan is politically subdivided into 50 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Abangay\n* Amamaros\n* Bagacay\n* Barasan\n* Batuan\n* Bongco\n* Cahaguichican\n* Callan\n* Cansilayan\n* Casalsagan\n* Cato-ogan\n* Cau-ayan\n* Culob\n* Danao\n* Dapitan\n* Dawis\n* Dongsol\n* Fundacion\n* Guinacas\n* Guibuangan\n* Igang\n* Intaluan\n* Iwa Ilaud\n* Iwa Ilaya\n* Jamabalud\n* Jebioc\n* Lay-Ahan\n* Primitivo Ledesma Ward (Pob.\n* Lopez Jaena Ward ([[Poblacion]])\n* Lumbo\n* Macatol\n* Malusgod\n* Naslo\n* Nabitasan\n* Naga\n* Nanga\n* Pajo\n* Palanguia\n* Fernando Parcon Ward ([[Poblacion]])\n* Pitogo\n* Polot-an\n* Purog\n* Rumbang\n* San Jose Ward ([[Poblacion]])\n* Sinuagan\n* Tuburan\n* Tumcon Ilaya\n* Tumcon Ilaud\n* Ubang\n* Zarrague\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Pototan, Iloilo\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 23\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 22\n| Mar high C = 30\n| Mar low C  = 23\n| Apr high C = 32\n| Apr low C  = 23\n| May high C = 32\n| May low C  = 25\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 25\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 24\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 24\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 57\n| Feb precipitation mm = 37\n| Mar precipitation mm = 41\n| Apr precipitation mm = 42\n| May precipitation mm = 98\n| Jun precipitation mm = 155\n| Jul precipitation mm = 187\n| Aug precipitation mm = 162\n| Sep precipitation mm = 179\n| Oct precipitation mm = 188\n| Nov precipitation mm = 114\n| Dec precipitation mm = 78\n| Jan rain days        = 12.0\n| Feb rain days        = 7.7\n| Mar rain days        = 9.2\n| Apr rain days        = 10.2\n| May rain days        = 19.5\n| Jun rain days        = 24.6\n| Jul rain days        = 26.9\n| Aug rain days        = 25.1\n| Sep rain days        = 25.5\n| Oct rain days        = 25.2\n| Nov rain days        = 18.0\n| Dec rain days        = 13.0\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/pototan_philippines_1692817\n| title =  Pototan: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 3 May 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 3 May 2020  \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Pototan\n| 1903 = 20964\n| 1918 = 25869\n| 1939 = 33020\n| 1948 = 34717\n| 1960 = 37231\n| 1970 = 37250\n| 1975 = 41363\n| 1980 = 44624\n| 1990 = 54035\n| 1995 = 56340\n| 2000 = 61206\n| 2007 = 67626\n| 2010 = 70955\n| 2015 = 75070\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Pototan, Iloilo, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=9&frmIdProvince=54&frmIdLgu=960 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Pototan\n|North     = [[Dingle, Iloilo|Dingle]]\n|East      = [[Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo|Barotac Nuevo]]\n|Southeast = [[Dumangas, Iloilo|Dumangas]]\n|South     = [[Zarraga, Iloilo|Zarraga]]\n|Southwest = [[New Lucena, Iloilo|New Lucena]]\n|West      = [[Badiangan, Iloilo|Badiangan]]<br>[[Mina, Iloilo|Mina]]\n}}\n{{Iloilo}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Iloilo]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=March 2013}}\n{{short description|Municipality of the Philippines in the province of Iloilo}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                   = {{PH wikidata|name}} \n| image_skyline          = Pototan -

wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nThe town lies on the banks of the [[Suage River]], {{convert|30|km}} north from [[Iloilo City]]. The town has an area of 94&nbsp;km\u00b2, 85% of which is agricultural land. In December 1997, it was declared as the \"Christmas Capital of [[Western Visayas]]\"{{by whom|date=February 2016}} because of its famed Christmas Festival of Lights.\n\nConsidered{{by whom|date=February 2016}} the rice granary of [[Panay]], the town is bordered by [[Dingle, Iloilo|Dingle]] to the north, [[Zarraga, Iloilo|Zarraga]] to the south, [[Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo|Barotac Nuevo]] to the east,  [[New Lucena, Iloilo]] and [[Mina, Iloilo|Mina]] to the west.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe first people of Pototan were the family of Datu Ramon, grandson of Datu Puti, a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] from the town of Dumangas.{{dubious|date=February 2016}} They first settled at Barangay Naslo, which was formerly the [[poblacion]] (town center). In that place was found a luxuriant growth of trees called ''\"putat\"'', after which the place was subsequently called ''\"Kaputatan\"'' or \"place of many Putat trees.\" However, due to its hilly terrain and poor water supply, they decided to move nearer the bank of the [[Suage River]], now called Pototan.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century, the [[China|Chinese]] traders arrived in Pototan.\n\n===Spanish era===\n[[File:Pototan - St. Joseph's Parish - Facade.JPG|thumb|St. Joseph's Church]]\nThe arrival of the [[Spain|Spaniards]] in 1593 sparked new changes in the socio-economic and political life of the natives. It was the start of a new era, the natives were converted to [[Catholicism]] through the efforts of [[Augustinian Friars]]. The settlement was subsequently made into a Parish. Education, though at the onset only for the privileged few, was introduced. The name ''\"Kaputatan\"'', which the Spanish have difficulty pronouncing, was changed to ''\"Pototan\"''.\n\nThe Spanish built roads and bridges.  Don Tomas Sajen and Don Escribano supervised the construction of the Tribunal (municipal hall) with the natives contributing the labor. The Tribunal withstood [[World War II]] and in the early 50s was modified into what is now the Western Visayas Hospital.\n\nIn 1874, Pototanons began to run their own political affairs with the appointment of Don Juan Marcelo as the first [[Capitan Municipal]]. This form of government continued until the arrival of the Americans.\n\nDuring the incumbency of Capitan Municipal Braulio Pe\u00f1aranda in 1891, there was a [[cholera]] outbreak.\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], Pototanons such as [[Teresa Magbanua]] (known as the Joan of arc of the Visayas{{Cook, Bernard A. (2006). Women and War: A Historical Encyclopedia from Antiquity to the Present. ABC-CLIO. p. 465. ISBN 978-1-85109-770-8.}}) and her two brothers, [[Elias Magbanua|Elias]] and [[Pascual Magbanua]] took up arms and joined the revolution.\n\nThe Americans arrived after Spain ceded Philippines to the [[United States]] in 1898. The remaining Spanish population fled to the hills together with many Filipinos including the last Gobernadorcillio, Don [[Maurillo Mendoza]]. He was later held prisoner by the Americans but subsequently named the first Municipal President.\n\n===American era===\nUnder the Americans, the natives were granted the freedom of speech and worship. Education was liberalized; more and better roads and bridges were constructed. Improvements were also noticed in the economic, social and cultural life of the people.\n\nDuring the incumbency of Mun. President [[Maurillo Mendoza]], the Pototanons again witnessed another unforgettable event: the burning of the entire half of the poblacion in November 1914. The cause of the fire is unknown.\n\nWhen the [[Philippine Constitution]] was ratified in 1935, another change in the town's local governance was introduced: the title of Municipal President was changed to Municipal Mayor. [[Santiago Puig]] was the first Municipal Mayor. He was succeeded by Mariano Pe\u00f1aflorida in 1940. Pe\u00f1aflorida served until September 16, 1942.\n\n===World War II===\nThe coming of the [[Japan]]ese during [[World War II]] spread chaos and fear among Pototanons. Mayor Pe\u00f1aflorida continued to act as Mayor under the Free Revolutionary Government of [[Tomas Confesor]] while the Japanese Imperial Forces designated [[Tomas Ferrariz]] as Puppet Mayor.\n\nOn 1945, during the Battle for the Liberation of Iloilo the combined Filipino and American troops together with the Ilonggo guerillas invaded the town of Pototan, Iloilo. The Liberation force included Allied Filipino soldiers of the 6th, 61st and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 6th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, They continued to combat the Japanese Imperial forces until the end of [[World War II]].\n\n==Barangays==\nPototan is politically subdivided into 50 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Abangay\n* Amamaros\n* Bagacay\n* Barasan\n* Batuan\n* Bongco\n* Cahaguichican\n* Callan\n* Cansilayan\n* Casalsagan\n* Cato-ogan\n* Cau-ayan\n* Culob\n* Danao\n* Dapitan\n* Dawis\n* Dongsol\n* Fundacion\n* Guinacas\n* Guibuangan\n* Igang\n* Intaluan\n* Iwa Ilaud\n* Iwa Ilaya\n* Jamabalud\n* Jebioc\n* Lay-Ahan\n* Primitivo Ledesma Ward (Pob.\n* Lopez Jaena Ward ([[Poblacion]])\n* Lumbo\n* Macatol\n* Malusgod\n* Naslo\n* Nabitasan\n* Naga\n* Nanga\n* Pajo\n* Palanguia\n* Fernando Parcon Ward ([[Poblacion]])\n* Pitogo\n* Polot-an\n* Purog\n* Rumbang\n* San Jose Ward ([[Poblacion]])\n* Sinuagan\n* Tuburan\n* Tumcon Ilaya\n* Tumcon Ilaud\n* Ubang\n* Zarrague\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Pototan, Iloilo\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 23\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 22\n| Mar high C = 30\n| Mar low C  = 23\n| Apr high C = 32\n| Apr low C  = 23\n| May high C = 32\n| May low C  = 25\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 25\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 24\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 24\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 57\n| Feb precipitation mm = 37\n| Mar precipitation mm = 41\n| Apr precipitation mm = 42\n| May precipitation mm = 98\n| Jun precipitation mm = 155\n| Jul precipitation mm = 187\n| Aug precipitation mm = 162\n| Sep precipitation mm = 179\n| Oct precipitation mm = 188\n| Nov precipitation mm = 114\n| Dec precipitation mm = 78\n| Jan rain days        = 12.0\n| Feb rain days        = 7.7\n| Mar rain days        = 9.2\n| Apr rain days        = 10.2\n| May rain days        = 19.5\n| Jun rain days        = 24.6\n| Jul rain days        = 26.9\n| Aug rain days        = 25.1\n| Sep rain days        = 25.5\n| Oct rain days        = 25.2\n| Nov rain days        = 18.0\n| Dec rain days        = 13.0\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/pototan_philippines_1692817\n| title =  Pototan: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 3 May 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 3 May 2020  \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Pototan\n| 1903 = 20964\n| 1918 = 25869\n| 1939 = 33020\n| 1948 = 34717\n| 1960 = 37231\n| 1970 = 37250\n| 1975 = 41363\n| 1980 = 44624\n| 1990 = 54035\n| 1995 = 56340\n| 2000 = 61206\n| 2007 = 67626\n| 2010 = 70955\n| 2015 = 75070\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Pototan, Iloilo, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=9&frmIdProvince=54&frmIdLgu=960 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Pototan\n|North     = [[Dingle, Iloilo|Dingle]]\n|East      = [[Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo|Barotac Nuevo]]\n|Southeast = [[Dumangas, Iloilo|Dumangas]]\n|South     = [[Zarraga, Iloilo|Zarraga]]\n|Southwest = [[New Lucena, Iloilo|New Lucena]]\n|West      = [[Badiangan, Iloilo|Badiangan]]<br>[[Mina, Iloilo|Mina]]\n}}\n{{Iloilo}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Iloilo]]\n", "name_user": "Uzume", "label": "safe", "comment": "defaults to the current QID", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pototan,_Iloilo"}
