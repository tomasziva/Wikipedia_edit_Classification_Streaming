For [[BBC Radio]] they wrote ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964\u201367), their best-remembered comedy series, which starred [[Kenneth Horne]] and [[Kenneth Williams]].<ref name=\"six\" /> (The last season of ''Round the Horne'' in 1968 was written by others.) This work placed Feldman and Took \"in the front rank of comedy writers\", according to [[Denis Norden]].<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nFeldman then became the chief writer and script editor on ''[[The Frost Report]]'' (1966\u201367). He co-wrote the much-shown [[Class sketch|\"Class\" sketch]] with John Law, in which [[John Cleese]], [[Ronnie Barker]] and [[Ronnie Corbett]] faced the audience, with their descending order of height, suggesting their relative social status as upper class (Cleese), middle class (Barker) and working class (Corbett).<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nThe television [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' raised Feldman's profile as a performer. The other three participants (future [[Monty Python]] members [[Graham Chapman]] and John Cleese, and future [[The Goodies]] member [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]) needed a fourth cast member and had Feldman in mind.<ref name=\"six\" /> In a sketch on 1 March 1967, Feldman's character harassed a patient shop assistant (played by Cleese) regarding a series of fictitious books, achieving success with ''Ethel the Aardvark Goes Quantity Surveying''. His character in ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was often called Mr Pest, according to John Cleese.<ref>[[BBC Radio 2]] programme ''East End Boys'', 2014</ref> Feldman was co-author, along with Cleese, Chapman and Brooke-Taylor of the [[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|\"Four Yorkshiremen\" sketch]], which was written for ''At Last the 1948 Show''.<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nFeldman was given his own series on the BBC called ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' in 1968;<ref name=\"six\" /> it featured Brooke-Taylor, [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]], with Cleese as one of the writers.<ref name=\"six\" /> Feldman won two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. The second series in 1969 was retitled ''It's Marty'' (the second title being retained for the [[DVD-Video|DVD]] of the show).\n\n== After 1970 ==\n[[File:Marty Feldman 1972.JPG|thumb|250px|Promotional photo for ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'', 1972]]\nIn 1971, Feldman gave evidence in favour of the defendants in the obscenity trial for [[OZ (magazine)#UK obscenity trial and appeal|''Oz'' magazine]].<ref name=\"six\" /> He would not swear on the Bible, choosing instead to affirm.<ref name=\"six\" /> Throughout his testimony, he mocked the judge after it was implied that he had no religion because he was not Christian.<ref name=\"six\" /> By this time, ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'' (1971\u20131972) was in preparation, a TV series co-produced by [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the UK and the [[American Broadcasting Company]] which was produced at ATV's [[BBC Elstree Centre|Elstree Studios]], near London.

The ''Marty'' series proved popular enough with an international audience (the first series won the Golden Rose Award at Montreux) to launch a film career. His first feature role was in ''Every Home Should Have One'' (1970).<ref name=\"six\" /> Feldman spent time in [[Soho]] jazz clubs, as he found a parallel between \"riffing\" in a comedy partnership and the improvisation of jazz.<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nOn film, in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), he was [[Igor (Young Frankenstein)|Igor]] (pronounced \"EYE-gore\", a comic response to [[Gene Wilder]]'s claim that \"it's pronounced FRONK-EN-SCHTEEN\"). Many lines in ''Young Frankenstein'' were improvised. Wilder says he had Feldman in mind when he wrote the part.<ref name=\"six\" /> \nFeldman's performances on American television included ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''.\n\nIn 1976, Feldman ventured into [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], starring with [[Barbara Bouchet]] in ''40 gradi all'ombra del lenzuolo'' ''([[Sex with a Smile]]''), a [[sex comedy]]. He appeared in ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'' and Brooks' ''[[Silent Movie]]'', as well as directing and starring in ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]''. He guest-starred in the \"Arabian Nights\" episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' with several ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters, especially [[Cookie Monster]], with whom he shared a playful cameo comparing their eyes side by side.\n\nDuring the course of his career, Feldman recorded two [[LP record]]s, ''Marty'' (1968) and ''I Feel a Song Going Off'' (1969), re-released in 1971 as ''The Crazy World of Marty Feldman''.

For [[BBC Radio]] they wrote ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964\u201367), their best-remembered comedy series, which starred [[Kenneth Horne]] and [[Kenneth Williams]].<ref name=\"six\" /> (The last season of ''Round the Horne'' in 1968 was written by others.) This work placed Feldman and Took \"in the front rank of comedy writers\", according to [[Denis Norden]].<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nFeldman then became the chief writer and script editor on ''[[The Frost Report]]'' (1966\u201367). He co-wrote the much-shown [[Class sketch|\"Class\" sketch]] with John Law, in which [[John Cleese]], [[Ronnie Barker]] and [[Ronnie Corbett]] faced the audience, with their descending order of height, suggesting their relative social status as upper class (Cleese), middle class (Barker) and working class (Corbett).<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nThe television [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' raised Feldman's profile as a performer. The other three participants (future [[Monty Python]] members [[Graham Chapman]] and John Cleese, and future [[The Goodies]] member [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]) needed a fourth cast member and had Feldman in mind.<ref name=\"six\" /> In a sketch on 1 March 1967, Feldman's character harassed a patient shop assistant (played by Cleese) regarding a series of fictitious books, achieving success with ''Ethel the Aardvark Goes Quantity Surveying''. His character in ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was often called Mr Pest, according to John Cleese.<ref>[[BBC Radio 2]] programme ''East End Boys'', 2014</ref> Feldman was co-author, along with Cleese, Chapman and Brooke-Taylor of the [[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|\"Four Yorkshiremen\" sketch]], which was written for ''At Last the 1948 Show''.<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nFeldman was given his own series on the BBC called ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' in 1968;<ref name=\"six\" /> it featured Brooke-Taylor, [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]], with Cleese as one of the writers.<ref name=\"six\" /> Feldman won two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. The second series in 1969 was retitled ''It's Marty'' (the second title being retained for the [[DVD-Video|DVD]] of the show).\n\n== After 1970 ==\n[[File:Marty Feldman 1972.JPG|thumb|250px|Promotional photo for ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'', 1972]]\nIn 1971, Feldman gave evidence in favour of the defendants in the obscenity trial for [[OZ (magazine)#UK obscenity trial and appeal|''Oz'' magazine]].<ref name=\"six\" /> He would not swear on the Bible, choosing instead to affirm.<ref name=\"six\" /> Throughout his testimony, he mocked the judge after it was implied that he had no religion because he was not Christian.<ref name=\"six\" /> By this time, ''[[The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine]]'' (1971\u20131972) was in preparation, a TV series co-produced by [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the UK and the [[American Broadcasting Company]] which was produced at ATV's [[BBC Elstree Centre|Elstree Studios]], near London.

The ''Marty'' series proved popular enough with an international audience (the first series won the Golden Rose Award at Montreux) to launch a film career. His first feature role was in ''Every Home Should Have One'' (1970).<ref name=\"six\" /> Feldman spent time in [[Soho]] jazz clubs, as he found a parallel between \"riffing\" in a comedy partnership and the improvisation of jazz.<ref name=\"six\" />\n\nOn film, in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), he was [[Igor (Young Frankenstein)|Igor]] (pronounced \"EYE-gore\", a comic response to [[Gene Wilder]]'s claim that \"it's pronounced FRONK-EN-SCHTEEN\"). Many lines in ''Young Frankenstein'' were improvised. Wilder says he had Feldman in mind when he wrote the part.<ref name=\"six\" /> \nFeldman's performances on American television included ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''.\n\nIn 1976, Feldman ventured into [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], starring with [[Barbara Bouchet]] in ''40 gradi all'ombra del lenzuolo'' ''([[Sex with a Smile]]''), a [[sex comedy]]. He appeared in ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'' and Brooks' ''[[Silent Movie]]'', as well as directing and starring in ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]''. He guest-starred in the \"Arabian Nights\" episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' with several ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters, especially [[Cookie Monster]], with whom he shared a playful cameo comparing their eyes side by side.\n\nDuring the course of his career, Feldman recorded two [[LP record]]s, ''Marty'' (1968) and ''I Feel a Song Going Off'' (1969), re-released in 1971 as ''The Crazy World of Marty Feldman''.
