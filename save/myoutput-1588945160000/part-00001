The U.S. Census Bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from Spain and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] concluded in 1848, term ''Hispanic'' or ''Spanish American'' was primarily used to describe the [[Hispanos of New Mexico]] within the [[American Southwest]]. The [[1970 United States Census]] controversially broadened the definition to \"a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race\". This is now the common formal and colloquial definition of the term within the United States, outside of New Mexico.<ref name=\"Cobos-1\">Cobos, Rub\u00e9n (2003) \"Introduction,\" ''A Dictionary of New Mexico & Southern Colorado Spanish'' (2nd ed.); Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press; p. ix; {{ISBN|0-89013-452-9}}</ref><ref name=\"OMB1997\">{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.

The first confirmed European landing in the continental United States was by [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], who landed in 1513 at a lush shore he christened ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''.

That same year [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] led 2,000 Spaniards and Mexican Indians across today's [[Arizona]]\u2013Mexico border and traveled as far as central [[Kansas]], close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States.

The overwhelmingly majority of Latinos descend from a mixture of Europeans and Native Americans, and depending on the regions within Latin America, a significant proportion also have high to moderate or low levels of colonial era Sub-Saharan African input. Up to a quarter of Latin Americans also possess colonial era [[New Christian]] Sephardic Jewish ancestry from a full-blooded ancestor of said ancestry within the last 8 generations. To a lesser extent other Latin Americans possess at least partial ancestry of more recent post-colonial ancestry from Ashkenazi Jews, Levantine Arabs (Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian), as well as Chinese and Japanese among others. Thus, as a whole, Latin Americans are a multiracial population, with degrees of admixture levels that vary from person to person, from varying global genetic sources. According to the [[American Community Survey|2017 American Community Survey]], 65% of Hispanic and Latinos identified as White. The largest numbers of those who consider themselves [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanics]] come from within the [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]], [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]], [[Cuban Americans|Cuban]], [[Colombian Americans|Colombian]] and [[Spanish Americans|Spanish]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918181635/http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-09-18 |title=Technical Documentation for the Census 2000 Modified Race Data Summary File |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=B03002.

Note that [[Filipinos]] are generally ''not'' counted as Hispanic, despite the fact that the Spanish colonized the Philippines and many Filipinos have Spanish names.\n\nHispanic and Latinos are racially diverse, although different \"races\" are usually the majority of each Hispanic group. For example, of Latinos deriving from northern Mexico, consider themselves White or acknowledge Native American ancestry with some European mixtures, while of those deriving from southern Mexican ancestry, the majority are Native American or of Native American and European Ancestry. In Guatemala, Native American and bi-racial people of Native American and European descent make the majority, while in El Salvador, whites and Bi-racial people of Native American/European descent are the majority. In the Dominican Republic the population are largely made up of people with inter-mixed ancestries, in which there are even levels of African and European ancestry, with smaller numbers of Whites and Blacks as well.\n\n[[File:Zoe Saldana (Headshot).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Zoe Saldana]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]] (2010)]]\nIn Puerto Rico, people with multi-racial ancestry are the majority.

As a result of their racial diversity, Hispanics form an [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|ethnicity]] sharing a language ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and cultural heritage, rather than a [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|race]]. The phenomenon of biracial people who are predominantly of European descent identifying as white is not limited to Hispanics or Spanish speakers but is also common among English speakers as well: researchers found that most White Americans with less than 28 percent African-American ancestry say they are White; above that threshold, people tended to describe themselves as African-American.<ref>Carl Zimmer (2014).

Global Advances in Health and Medicine, 2(5), 70-74.</ref> Multiple factors such as limited access to health care, legal status and income increase the risk of developing preventable health conditions because many undocumented immigrants postpone routine visits to the doctor until they become seriously ill.\n\n==Mental health==\n\n===Family separation===\n\nDuring the process of migrating to the United States, there are instances in their journey where families experience separation. Before the migration begins, those who are making the journey to the U.S. have to leave behind their families along with their homeland. Additionally, families who are in the process of crossing borders suffer being caught and separated by border patrol agents. Migrants are also in danger of separation if they do not have sufficient resources such as water for all members to continue crossing. Once migrants have arrived to the new country they fear workplace raids where immigrant parents are detained and deported.\n\t\nFamily separation puts U.S born children, undocumented children and their undocumented parents at risk for depression and family maladaptive syndrome. The effects are often long-term and the impact extends to the community level. Children will experience emotional traumas and long-term changes in behaviors. Additionally, when parents are forcefully removed, children develop feelings of abandonment and they might blame themselves for what has happened to their family. Children that are victims to family separation believe in the possibility of never seeing their parents again. These effects can cause negative parent-child attachment. Reunification may be difficult because of harsh immigration laws and re-entry restrictions which further affect the mental health of children and parents.<ref>Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H. (2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12</ref> \n\t\nParents who leave behind everything in their home country also experience negative mental health experiences. According to a study published in 2013, 46% of Mexican migrant men who participated in the study reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms.<ref name=\"auto2\">Letiecq, B., L., Grzywacz, J., G., Gray, K., M., Eudave, Y., M.(2014). Depression among Mexican men on the migration frontier: the role of family separation and other structural and situational stressors. [[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]], 16, 1193-1200</ref> In recent years, the length of stay for migrants has increased, from 3 years to nearly a decade.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Migrants who were separated from their families, either married or single, experienced greater depression than married men accompanied by their spouses.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Furthermore, the study also revealed that men who are separated from their families are more prone to harsher living conditions such as overcrowded housing and are under a greater deal of pressure to send remittance to support their families. These conditions put additional stress on the migrants and often worsens their depression. Families who migrated together experience better living conditions, receive emotional encouragement and motivation from each other, and share a sense of solidarity. They are also more likely to successfully navigate the employment and health care systems in the new country, and aren't pressured to send remittances back home.\n\n===Discrimination===\nIt is reported that 31% of Latinos reported personal experiences with discrimination whilst 82% believed that discrimination plays a crucial role in whether they will find success living in the U.S.<ref name=\"auto3\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H. (2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> The current legislation on immigration policies also plays crucial role in creating a hostile and discriminatory environment for immigrants. In order to measure discrimination for immigrants, it is taken from their perceived discrimination that they feel is towards them and can vary from: personal experiences, social attitudes and ethnic group barriers. The immigrant experience is associated to lower-self esteem, internalizing symptoms and problem behaviors amongst Mexican youth. It is also known that more time spent living in the U.S. is associated with increased feelings of distress, depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Like many other Hispanic and Latino American groups that migrate to the United States, these groups are often stigmatized and given a bad rep. An example would be after 9/11, the migrant \"Latino Other\" along with the terms refugee and asylum seeker have often been seen as a threat to nation security.<ref>Quayson, A., Daswani, G. (2013). A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishing</ref>\n\n===Vulnerabilities===\n\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and [[Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] significantly changed how the United States dealt with immigration. Under this new law, immigrants who overstayed their visas or were found to be in the U.S illegally were subject to be detained and/or deported without legal representation. Immigrants found themselves vulnerable and living in constant fear and mistrust because they may not be allowed back into the country indefinitely. Similarly, this law made it more difficult for other immigrants who want to enter the U.S or gain legal status. These laws also expanded the types of offenses that can be considered worthy of deportation for documented immigrants.<ref name=\"auto4\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H.(2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> Policies enacted by future presidents further limit the number of immigrants entering the country and their expedited removal.\n\nMany immigrant families cannot enjoy doing everyday activities without exercising caution because they fear encountering immigration officers which limits their involvement in community events. Immigrant families also do not trust government institutions and services. Because of their fear of encountering immigration officers, immigrants often feel ostracized and isolated which can lead to the development of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The harmful effects of being ostracized from the rest of society are not limited to just that of undocumented immigrants but it affects the entire family even if some of the members are of legal status. Children often reported having been victims of bullying in school by classmates because their parents are undocumented.<ref>Hinojos, B. (2013). Stressors and Coping Strategies of Undocumented Latinos in Therapy. Public Access Theses and Dissertations from the College of Education and Human Sciences. Retrieved from: https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=cehsdiss</ref> This can cause them to feel isolated and develop a sense of inferiority which can negatively impact their academic performance.\n\n===Stress===\n\nDespite the struggles Latinos families encounter, they have found ways to keep motivated. Many immigrants use religion as a source of motivation. Mexican immigrants believed that the difficulties they face are a part of God's bigger plan and believe their life will get better in the end. They kept their faith strong and pray everyday, hoping that God will keep their families safe.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\">Hinojos, B.(2013). Stressors and Coping Strategies of Undocumented Latinos in Therapy. Public Access Theses and Dissertations from the College of Education and Human Sciences. Retrieved from: https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=cehsdiss</ref> Immigrants participate in church services and bond with other immigrants that share the same experiences.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Undocumented Latinos also find support from friends, family and the community that serve as coping mechanisms. Some Latinos state that their children are the reason they have the strength to keep on going. They want their children to have a future and give them things they aren't able to have themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> The community is able to provide certain resources that immigrant families need such as tutoring for their children, financial assistance, and counseling services.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Some identified that maintaining a positive mental attitude helped them cope with the stresses they experience. Many immigrants refuse to live their life in constant fear which leads to depression in order to enjoy life in the U.S.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> Since many immigrants have unstable sources of income, many plan ahead in order to prevent future financial stress. They put money aside and find ways to save money instead of spend it such as learning to fix appliances themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\n\nMany Latino families migrate to find better economic opportunities in order to send remittances back home. Being undocumented limits the possibilities of jobs that immigrants undertake and many struggle to find a stable job. Many Latinos report that companies turned them down because they do not have a Social Security number. If they are able to obtain a job, immigrants risk losing it if their employer finds out they are unable to provide proof of residency or citizenship. Many look towards agencies that do not ask for identification, but those jobs are often unreliable. In order to prevent themselves from being detained and deported, many have to work under exploitation. In a study, a participant reported \"If someone knows that you don't have the papers. . .that person is a danger. Many people will con them. . . if they know you don't have the papers, with everything they say 'hey I'm going to call immigration on you.'\".<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> These conditions lower the income that Latino families bring to their household and some find living each day very difficult. When an undocumented parent is deported or detained, income will be lowered significantly if the other parent also supports the family financially. The parent who is left has to look after the family and might find working difficult to manage along with other responsibilities. Even if families aren't separated, Latinos are constantly living in fear that they will lose their economic footing.\n\nLiving in poverty has been linked to depression, low self-esteem, loneliness, crime activities and frequent drug use among youth.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Families with low incomes are unable to afford adequate housing and some of them are evicted. The environment in which the children of undocumented immigrants grow up in are often composed of poor air quality, noise, and toxins which prevent healthy development.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Furthermore, these neighborhoods are prone to violence and gang activities, forcing the families to live in constant fear which can contribute to the development of PTSD, aggression, and depression.\n\n== Economic outlook ==\n=== Median income ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:88%\"\n|+ Median household income (2015)\n|-\n!Ethnicity or nationality\n!Income\n|-\n| [[Argentine Americans|Argentinean]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $60,640\n|-\n| [[Spanish Americans|Spaniards]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $60,000\n|-\n| [[Venezuelan Americans|Venezuelan]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $56,800\n|-\n| [[Peruvian Americans|Peruvian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $56,000\n|-\n| [[Colombian Americans|Colombian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $54,500\n|-\n| [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $51,000\n|-\n| [[Nicaraguan Americans|Nicaraguans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $51,000\n|-\n| [[Salvadoran Americans|Salvadoran]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $47,600\n|-\n| [[Cuban Americans|Cubans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $44,400\n|-\n| [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $44,200\n|-\n| [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $40,500\n|-\n| [[Guatemalan Americans|Guatemalans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $40,200\n|-\n| [[Dominican Americans|Dominicans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $36,800\n|-\n| [[Honduran Americans|Hondurans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $36,800\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| colspan=3 | Sources:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/09/15/the-impact-of-slowing-immigration-foreign-born-share-falls-among-14-largest-us-hispanic-origin-groups/|title=The Impact of Slowing Immigration: Foreign-Born Share Falls Among 14 Largest U.S. Hispanic Origin Groups|work=Pew Research Center|accessdate=15 September 2015|first=Gustavo|last=L\u00f3pez|date=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n|}\nIn 2017, the US Census reported the median household incomes of Hispanic and Latino Americans to be $50,486.

However, generally, Spanish spoken in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] is [[Mexican Spanish]] (or [[Chicano|Chicano Spanish]]). An old, colonial variety of Spanish is spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]], which is [[New Mexican Spanish]]. One of the major distinctions of New Mexican Spanish is its heavy use of colonial vocabulary and verb tenses that make [[New Mexican Spanish]] uniquely American amongst Spanish dialects. The Spanish spoken in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] is [[Caribbean Spanish]] and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. [[Canarian Spanish]] is the historic Spanish dialect spoken by the descendants of the earliest Spanish colonists beginning in the 18th century in [[Louisiana]]. Spanish spoken elsewhere throughout the country varies, although is generally [[Mexican Spanish]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/spanish-foreign-language_n_3430860.html|title=8 Reasons Spanish Isn't A Foreign Language In The U.S. (SLIDESHOW)|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nMost generations of descendants of immigrants after the first generation of Spanish speakers tend to speak the Spanish language with accents of American English of the region in which they grew up.\n\n====Spanglish and English dialects====\n{{main|Chicano English|Spanglish|Miami#Dialect|New York Latino English}}\n{{see also|List of English words of Spanish origin}}\nHispanics have influenced the way Americans speak with the introduction of many Spanish words into the English language. Amongst younger generations of Hispanics, [[Spanglish]], or a mix of Spanish and English, may be a common way of speaking. Although they are fluent in both languages, speakers will switch between Spanish and English throughout the conversation. Spanglish is particularly common in Hispanic-majority cities and communities such as [[Miami]], [[Hialeah]], [[San Antonio]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/spanglish/book/|title=Do You Speak American .

In Miami, for example, the [[Miami#Dialect|Miami dialect]] has evolved as the most common form of English spoken and heard in Miami today. This is a native dialect of English, and was developed amongst second and third generations of [[Cuban American]]s in Miami. Today, it is commonly heard everywhere throughout the city. [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]] are examples of people who speak with the Miami dialect. Another major English dialect, is spoken by [[Chicano]]s and [[Tejano]]s in the [[Southwestern United States]], called [[Chicano English]].

The role of [[grandparent]]s is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandparents.about.com/od/grandparentingtoday/a/hispanic_family.htm|title=Grandparents Important in Hispanic Family Structure|author=Susan Adcox|work=About.com Parenting|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nHispanics tend to be very group-oriented, and an emphasis is placed on the well-being of the family above the individual. The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families, and frequent social, family gatherings are common. Traditional rites of passages, particularly [[Roman Catholic]] [[sacrament]]s: such as [[baptism]]s, birthdays, [[First Holy Communion]]s, [[quincea\u00f1era]]s, [[Confirmation]]s, [[graduation]]s and [[wedding]]s are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|title=Hispanic Priorities: Marriage, Family and Youth|website=Hispanics.barna.org|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301025546/http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|archivedate=1 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2011/03/cultural-values-of-latino-patients-and-families/|title=Cultural Values of Latino Patients and Families|website=Dimensionsofculture.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nEducation is another important priority for Hispanic families. Education is seen as the key towards continued [[upward mobility]] in the United States among Hispanic families. A 2010 study by the Associated Press showed that Hispanics place a higher emphasis on education than the average American.

Crossing the borders changes the identities of both the youth and their families. Often \"one must pay special attention to the role expressive culture plays as both entertainment and as a site in which identity is played out, empowered, and reformed\" because it is \"sometimes in opposition to dominant norms and practices and sometimes in conjunction with them.\"<ref name=\"Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette 2004\">Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette. 2004.

New York: Columbia University Press.</ref> The exchange of their culture of origin with American culture creates a dichotomy within the values that the youth find important, therefore changing what it means to be Latino in the global sphere.\n\n==== Transnationalism ====\n[[File:Camila_Cabello_(Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Camila Cabello]] was born in [[Cuba]]. She moved between [[Havana]] and [[Mexico City]] before locating to [[Miami]] at age 5.]]\n\nAlong with feeling that they are neither from the country of their ethnic background nor the United States, a new identity within the United States is formed called ''[[latinidad]]''. This is especially seen in cosmopolitan social settings like New York City, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Underway is \"the intermeshing of different Latino subpopulations has laid the foundations for the emergence and ongoing evolution of a strong sense of ''latinidad\"'' which establishes a \"sense of cultural affinity and identity deeply rooted in what many Latinos perceive to be a shared historical, spiritual, aesthetic and linguistic heritage, and a growing sense of cultural affinity and solidarity in the social context of the United States.\"<ref name=\"Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette 2004\"/> This unites Latinos as one, creating cultural kin with other Latino ethnicities.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Gender roles ====\n[[File:Quincea\u00f1eraSanFranValleBravo.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Quincea\u00f1era]] after a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], celebrating a daughter's 15th birthday, common among Hispanic families]]\nMigration to the United States can change identity for Latino youth in various way, including how they carry their gendered identities. In traditional Latino households, women and young girls are homebodies or ''muchachas de la casa'' (\"girls of the house\"), showing that they abide \"by the cultural norms ... [of] respectability, chastity, and family honor [as] valued by the [Latino] community.\"<ref>Souza, Caridad (2002) \"The Sexual Identities of Young Puerto Rican Mothers,\" Di\u00e1logo: Vol. 6: No. 1, Article 10.</ref> However, when Latina women come to the United States, they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country, and their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners. The unassimilated community views these adapting women as being ''de la calle'' (\"of [or from] the street\"), transgressive and sexually promiscuous. Some Latino families in the United States \"deal with young women's failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways, including sending them to live in ... [the sending country] with family members, regardless of whether or not ... [the young women] are sexually active.\"<ref>P\u00e9rez, Gina. (2003), 'Puertorrique\u00f1as Rencorosas y Mejicanas Sufridas': Gendered Ethnic Identity Formation in Chicago's Latino Communities. Journal of Latin American Anthropology 8(2): 96\u2013124.</ref>\n\nAlong with the increase in independence amongst these young women, there is a diminution in the power of ''[[verg\u00fcenza]]'' (\"shame\") in many of the relations between the two sexes. To have ''verg\u00fcenza'' is to assert male dominance in all spheres, especially in a man's relationship with his female partner; the concept is enforced through shaming males into comporting themselves with a ''[[Machismo|macho]]'' (literally, \"male\" or \"masculine\") archetype in order to establish respect, dominance, and manliness in their social ambits. Although many Latina women in the homeland as well as older Latina women in the United States reinforce this dynamic by not wanting a man who is a ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' (\"shameless one\"), some Latinx youth accept the label of ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' and now wear it proudly. Feeling caught between two distinct societies causes youth to \"meditate between the two cultures and [instills] ambivalence toward feeling a lack of ''verg\u00fcenza''\",<ref>Barriga, Miguel D\u00edaz. 2001. Verg\u00fcenza and Changing Chicano and Chicana Narratives. Men and Masculinities 3(1) 278-298.</ref> resulting in a group of youth who celebrate being ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' while still acknowledging the concept of ''verg\u00fcenza'' within a part of their increasingly composite culture.\n\n==== Sexuality ====\nWith the [[Catholic Church]] remaining a large influence on the Latino culture, the subject of promiscuity and sexuality is often considered taboo. It is taught in many Latino cultures that best way to remain pure of sin and not become pregnant is to remain celibate and heterosexual. All are to be straight and women are to be virgins. A woman must carry herself like a [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]] in order to receive respect and keep the family's honor.\n\nHowever, despite being told that they should essentially suppress any natural feeling of sexual curiosity, through the globalization of encouraging sexual liberation, many young Latina women take their sexuality into their own hands and do not listen to the Madonna ideal. Despite this oppressive nature, \"women are neither passive nor one-dimensional individuals who automatically adapt to these culturally and socially defined moral prescriptions shaping their sex lives in some way\" but instead \"sophisticated, multidimensional, and active social agents who react to these prescriptions in multiform and complicated ways\".<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez, Gloria. 2007.

The U.S. Census Bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from Spain and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] concluded in 1848, term ''Hispanic'' or ''Spanish American'' was primarily used to describe the [[Hispanos of New Mexico]] within the [[American Southwest]]. The [[1970 United States Census]] controversially broadened the definition to \"a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race\". This is now the common formal and colloquial definition of the term within the United States, outside of New Mexico.<ref name=\"Cobos-1\">Cobos, Rub\u00e9n (2003) \"Introduction,\" ''A Dictionary of New Mexico & Southern Colorado Spanish'' (2nd ed.); Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press; p. ix; {{ISBN|0-89013-452-9}}</ref><ref name=\"OMB1997\">{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.

That same year [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] led 2,000 Spaniards and Mexican Indians across today's [[Arizona]]\u2013Mexico border and traveled as far as central [[Kansas]], close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States.

The overwhelmingly majority of Latinos descend from a mixture of Europeans and Native Americans, and depending on the regions within Latin America, a significant proportion also have high to moderate or low levels of colonial era Sub-Saharan African input. Up to a quarter of Latin Americans also possess colonial era [[New Christian]] Sephardic Jewish ancestry from a full-blooded ancestor of said ancestry within the last 8 generations. To a lesser extent other Latin Americans possess at least partial ancestry of more recent post-colonial ancestry from Ashkenazi Jews, Levantine Arabs (Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian), as well as Chinese and Japanese among others. Thus, as a whole, Latin Americans are a multiracial population, with degrees of admixture levels that vary from person to person, from varying global genetic sources. According to the [[American Community Survey|2017 American Community Survey]], 65% of Hispanic and Latinos identified as White. The largest numbers of those who consider themselves [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanics]] come from within the [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]], [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]], [[Cuban Americans|Cuban]], [[Colombian Americans|Colombian]] and [[Spanish Americans|Spanish]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918181635/http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-09-18 |title=Technical Documentation for the Census 2000 Modified Race Data Summary File |publisher=United States Census Bureau }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=B03002.

However, due to the landmark Supreme Court case ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'' in 1982, immigrants are allowed access to K-12 education. This significantly impacted all immigrant groups, including Latinos.

Global Advances in Health and Medicine, 2(5), 70-74.</ref> Multiple factors such as limited access to health care, legal status and income increase the risk of developing preventable health conditions because many undocumented immigrants postpone routine visits to the doctor until they become seriously ill.\n\n==Mental health==\n\n===Family separation===\n\nDuring the process of migrating to the United States, there are instances in their journey where families experience separation. Before the migration begins, those who are making the journey to the U.S. have to leave behind their families along with their homeland. Additionally, families who are in the process of crossing borders suffer being caught and separated by border patrol agents. Migrants are also in danger of separation if they do not have sufficient resources such as water for all members to continue crossing. Once migrants have arrived to the new country they fear workplace raids where immigrant parents are detained and deported.\n\t\nFamily separation puts U.S born children, undocumented children and their undocumented parents at risk for depression and family maladaptive syndrome. The effects are often long-term and the impact extends to the community level. Children will experience emotional traumas and long-term changes in behaviors. Additionally, when parents are forcefully removed, children develop feelings of abandonment and they might blame themselves for what has happened to their family. Children that are victims to family separation believe in the possibility of never seeing their parents again. These effects can cause negative parent-child attachment. Reunification may be difficult because of harsh immigration laws and re-entry restrictions which further affect the mental health of children and parents.<ref>Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H. (2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12</ref> \n\t\nParents who leave behind everything in their home country also experience negative mental health experiences. According to a study published in 2013, 46% of Mexican migrant men who participated in the study reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms.<ref name=\"auto2\">Letiecq, B., L., Grzywacz, J., G., Gray, K., M., Eudave, Y., M.(2014).

[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]], 16, 1193-1200</ref> In recent years, the length of stay for migrants has increased, from 3 years to nearly a decade.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Migrants who were separated from their families, either married or single, experienced greater depression than married men accompanied by their spouses.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Furthermore, the study also revealed that men who are separated from their families are more prone to harsher living conditions such as overcrowded housing and are under a greater deal of pressure to send remittance to support their families. These conditions put additional stress on the migrants and often worsens their depression. Families who migrated together experience better living conditions, receive emotional encouragement and motivation from each other, and share a sense of solidarity. They are also more likely to successfully navigate the employment and health care systems in the new country, and aren't pressured to send remittances back home.\n\n===Discrimination===\nIt is reported that 31% of Latinos reported personal experiences with discrimination whilst 82% believed that discrimination plays a crucial role in whether they will find success living in the U.S.<ref name=\"auto3\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H. (2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> The current legislation on immigration policies also plays crucial role in creating a hostile and discriminatory environment for immigrants. In order to measure discrimination for immigrants, it is taken from their perceived discrimination that they feel is towards them and can vary from: personal experiences, social attitudes and ethnic group barriers. The immigrant experience is associated to lower-self esteem, internalizing symptoms and problem behaviors amongst Mexican youth. It is also known that more time spent living in the U.S. is associated with increased feelings of distress, depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Like many other Hispanic and Latino American groups that migrate to the United States, these groups are often stigmatized and given a bad rep. An example would be after 9/11, the migrant \"Latino Other\" along with the terms refugee and asylum seeker have often been seen as a threat to nation security.<ref>Quayson, A., Daswani, G. (2013). A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishing</ref>\n\n===Vulnerabilities===\n\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and [[Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] significantly changed how the United States dealt with immigration. Under this new law, immigrants who overstayed their visas or were found to be in the U.S illegally were subject to be detained and/or deported without legal representation. Immigrants found themselves vulnerable and living in constant fear and mistrust because they may not be allowed back into the country indefinitely. Similarly, this law made it more difficult for other immigrants who want to enter the U.S or gain legal status. These laws also expanded the types of offenses that can be considered worthy of deportation for documented immigrants.<ref name=\"auto4\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H.(2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> Policies enacted by future presidents further limit the number of immigrants entering the country and their expedited removal.\n\nMany immigrant families cannot enjoy doing everyday activities without exercising caution because they fear encountering immigration officers which limits their involvement in community events. Immigrant families also do not trust government institutions and services. Because of their fear of encountering immigration officers, immigrants often feel ostracized and isolated which can lead to the development of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The harmful effects of being ostracized from the rest of society are not limited to just that of undocumented immigrants but it affects the entire family even if some of the members are of legal status. Children often reported having been victims of bullying in school by classmates because their parents are undocumented.<ref>Hinojos, B. (2013).

Retrieved from: https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=cehsdiss</ref> This can cause them to feel isolated and develop a sense of inferiority which can negatively impact their academic performance.\n\n===Stress===\n\nDespite the struggles Latinos families encounter, they have found ways to keep motivated. Many immigrants use religion as a source of motivation. Mexican immigrants believed that the difficulties they face are a part of God's bigger plan and believe their life will get better in the end. They kept their faith strong and pray everyday, hoping that God will keep their families safe.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\">Hinojos, B.(2013).

Some Latinos state that their children are the reason they have the strength to keep on going. They want their children to have a future and give them things they aren't able to have themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> The community is able to provide certain resources that immigrant families need such as tutoring for their children, financial assistance, and counseling services.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Some identified that maintaining a positive mental attitude helped them cope with the stresses they experience. Many immigrants refuse to live their life in constant fear which leads to depression in order to enjoy life in the U.S.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> Since many immigrants have unstable sources of income, many plan ahead in order to prevent future financial stress. They put money aside and find ways to save money instead of spend it such as learning to fix appliances themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\n\nMany Latino families migrate to find better economic opportunities in order to send remittances back home. Being undocumented limits the possibilities of jobs that immigrants undertake and many struggle to find a stable job. Many Latinos report that companies turned them down because they do not have a Social Security number. If they are able to obtain a job, immigrants risk losing it if their employer finds out they are unable to provide proof of residency or citizenship. Many look towards agencies that do not ask for identification, but those jobs are often unreliable. In order to prevent themselves from being detained and deported, many have to work under exploitation. In a study, a participant reported \"If someone knows that you don't have the papers. . .that person is a danger. Many people will con them. . . if they know you don't have the papers, with everything they say 'hey I'm going to call immigration on you.'\".<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> These conditions lower the income that Latino families bring to their household and some find living each day very difficult. When an undocumented parent is deported or detained, income will be lowered significantly if the other parent also supports the family financially. The parent who is left has to look after the family and might find working difficult to manage along with other responsibilities. Even if families aren't separated, Latinos are constantly living in fear that they will lose their economic footing.\n\nLiving in poverty has been linked to depression, low self-esteem, loneliness, crime activities and frequent drug use among youth.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Families with low incomes are unable to afford adequate housing and some of them are evicted. The environment in which the children of undocumented immigrants grow up in are often composed of poor air quality, noise, and toxins which prevent healthy development.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Furthermore, these neighborhoods are prone to violence and gang activities, forcing the families to live in constant fear which can contribute to the development of PTSD, aggression, and depression.\n\n== Economic outlook ==\n=== Median income ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:88%\"\n|+ Median household income (2015)\n|-\n!Ethnicity or nationality\n!Income\n|-\n| [[Argentine Americans|Argentinean]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $60,640\n|-\n| [[Spanish Americans|Spaniards]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $60,000\n|-\n| [[Venezuelan Americans|Venezuelan]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $56,800\n|-\n| [[Peruvian Americans|Peruvian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $56,000\n|-\n| [[Colombian Americans|Colombian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $54,500\n|-\n| [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $51,000\n|-\n| [[Nicaraguan Americans|Nicaraguans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $51,000\n|-\n| [[Salvadoran Americans|Salvadoran]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $47,600\n|-\n| [[Cuban Americans|Cubans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $44,400\n|-\n| [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $44,200\n|-\n| [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $40,500\n|-\n| [[Guatemalan Americans|Guatemalans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $40,200\n|-\n| [[Dominican Americans|Dominicans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $36,800\n|-\n| [[Honduran Americans|Hondurans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $36,800\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| colspan=3 | Sources:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/09/15/the-impact-of-slowing-immigration-foreign-born-share-falls-among-14-largest-us-hispanic-origin-groups/|title=The Impact of Slowing Immigration: Foreign-Born Share Falls Among 14 Largest U.S. Hispanic Origin Groups|work=Pew Research Center|accessdate=15 September 2015|first=Gustavo|last=L\u00f3pez|date=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n|}\nIn 2017, the US Census reported the median household incomes of Hispanic and Latino Americans to be $50,486.

An old, colonial variety of Spanish is spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]], which is [[New Mexican Spanish]]. One of the major distinctions of New Mexican Spanish is its heavy use of colonial vocabulary and verb tenses that make [[New Mexican Spanish]] uniquely American amongst Spanish dialects. The Spanish spoken in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] is [[Caribbean Spanish]] and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. [[Canarian Spanish]] is the historic Spanish dialect spoken by the descendants of the earliest Spanish colonists beginning in the 18th century in [[Louisiana]].

Amongst younger generations of Hispanics, [[Spanglish]], or a mix of Spanish and English, may be a common way of speaking. Although they are fluent in both languages, speakers will switch between Spanish and English throughout the conversation. Spanglish is particularly common in Hispanic-majority cities and communities such as [[Miami]], [[Hialeah]], [[San Antonio]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/spanglish/book/|title=Do You Speak American .

In Miami, for example, the [[Miami#Dialect|Miami dialect]] has evolved as the most common form of English spoken and heard in Miami today. This is a native dialect of English, and was developed amongst second and third generations of [[Cuban American]]s in Miami. Today, it is commonly heard everywhere throughout the city. [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]] are examples of people who speak with the Miami dialect.

Statistically, Hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the American average. Hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members. This may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other, although four generations is uncommon in the United States. The role of [[grandparent]]s is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandparents.about.com/od/grandparentingtoday/a/hispanic_family.htm|title=Grandparents Important in Hispanic Family Structure|author=Susan Adcox|work=About.com Parenting|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nHispanics tend to be very group-oriented, and an emphasis is placed on the well-being of the family above the individual. The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families, and frequent social, family gatherings are common. Traditional rites of passages, particularly [[Roman Catholic]] [[sacrament]]s: such as [[baptism]]s, birthdays, [[First Holy Communion]]s, [[quincea\u00f1era]]s, [[Confirmation]]s, [[graduation]]s and [[wedding]]s are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|title=Hispanic Priorities: Marriage, Family and Youth|website=Hispanics.barna.org|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301025546/http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|archivedate=1 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2011/03/cultural-values-of-latino-patients-and-families/|title=Cultural Values of Latino Patients and Families|website=Dimensionsofculture.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nEducation is another important priority for Hispanic families.

A further 13% admitted to \"being bothered but accepting\" of a marriage of a family member to a White and 22% admitted to \"being bothered but accepting\" of a marriage of a family member to a Black. Only 5% of Hispanics objected outright marriage of a family member to a non-Hispanic Black and 2% to a non-Hispanic White.<ref name=\"Pew Social Trends: Marrying Out\"/>\n\nUnlike intermarriage with other racial groups, intermarriage with non-Hispanic Blacks varies by nationality of origin.

Crossing the borders changes the identities of both the youth and their families. Often \"one must pay special attention to the role expressive culture plays as both entertainment and as a site in which identity is played out, empowered, and reformed\" because it is \"sometimes in opposition to dominant norms and practices and sometimes in conjunction with them.\"<ref name=\"Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette 2004\">Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette. 2004.

New York: Columbia University Press.</ref> The exchange of their culture of origin with American culture creates a dichotomy within the values that the youth find important, therefore changing what it means to be Latino in the global sphere.\n\n==== Transnationalism ====\n[[File:Camila_Cabello_(Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Camila Cabello]] was born in [[Cuba]]. She moved between [[Havana]] and [[Mexico City]] before locating to [[Miami]] at age 5.]]\n\nAlong with feeling that they are neither from the country of their ethnic background nor the United States, a new identity within the United States is formed called ''[[latinidad]]''. This is especially seen in cosmopolitan social settings like New York City, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Underway is \"the intermeshing of different Latino subpopulations has laid the foundations for the emergence and ongoing evolution of a strong sense of ''latinidad\"'' which establishes a \"sense of cultural affinity and identity deeply rooted in what many Latinos perceive to be a shared historical, spiritual, aesthetic and linguistic heritage, and a growing sense of cultural affinity and solidarity in the social context of the United States.\"<ref name=\"Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette 2004\"/> This unites Latinos as one, creating cultural kin with other Latino ethnicities.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Gender roles ====\n[[File:Quincea\u00f1eraSanFranValleBravo.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Quincea\u00f1era]] after a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], celebrating a daughter's 15th birthday, common among Hispanic families]]\nMigration to the United States can change identity for Latino youth in various way, including how they carry their gendered identities. In traditional Latino households, women and young girls are homebodies or ''muchachas de la casa'' (\"girls of the house\"), showing that they abide \"by the cultural norms ... [of] respectability, chastity, and family honor [as] valued by the [Latino] community.\"<ref>Souza, Caridad (2002) \"The Sexual Identities of Young Puerto Rican Mothers,\" Di\u00e1logo: Vol. 6: No. 1, Article 10.</ref> However, when Latina women come to the United States, they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country, and their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners. The unassimilated community views these adapting women as being ''de la calle'' (\"of [or from] the street\"), transgressive and sexually promiscuous. Some Latino families in the United States \"deal with young women's failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways, including sending them to live in ... [the sending country] with family members, regardless of whether or not ... [the young women] are sexually active.\"<ref>P\u00e9rez, Gina. (2003), 'Puertorrique\u00f1as Rencorosas y Mejicanas Sufridas': Gendered Ethnic Identity Formation in Chicago's Latino Communities. Journal of Latin American Anthropology 8(2): 96\u2013124.</ref>\n\nAlong with the increase in independence amongst these young women, there is a diminution in the power of ''[[verg\u00fcenza]]'' (\"shame\") in many of the relations between the two sexes. To have ''verg\u00fcenza'' is to assert male dominance in all spheres, especially in a man's relationship with his female partner; the concept is enforced through shaming males into comporting themselves with a ''[[Machismo|macho]]'' (literally, \"male\" or \"masculine\") archetype in order to establish respect, dominance, and manliness in their social ambits. Although many Latina women in the homeland as well as older Latina women in the United States reinforce this dynamic by not wanting a man who is a ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' (\"shameless one\"), some Latinx youth accept the label of ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' and now wear it proudly. Feeling caught between two distinct societies causes youth to \"meditate between the two cultures and [instills] ambivalence toward feeling a lack of ''verg\u00fcenza''\",<ref>Barriga, Miguel D\u00edaz. 2001. Verg\u00fcenza and Changing Chicano and Chicana Narratives. Men and Masculinities 3(1) 278-298.</ref> resulting in a group of youth who celebrate being ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' while still acknowledging the concept of ''verg\u00fcenza'' within a part of their increasingly composite culture.\n\n==== Sexuality ====\nWith the [[Catholic Church]] remaining a large influence on the Latino culture, the subject of promiscuity and sexuality is often considered taboo. It is taught in many Latino cultures that best way to remain pure of sin and not become pregnant is to remain celibate and heterosexual. All are to be straight and women are to be virgins. A woman must carry herself like a [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]] in order to receive respect and keep the family's honor.\n\nHowever, despite being told that they should essentially suppress any natural feeling of sexual curiosity, through the globalization of encouraging sexual liberation, many young Latina women take their sexuality into their own hands and do not listen to the Madonna ideal.

The transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the Latino immigrant population.
