The word \"n\u016br'\" is Arabic for \"light\", and has been passed on to many other languages. It is often used in the [[Quran]], notably in a verse that states\nhas been the subject of much discussion. Many classical commentators on the Quran considered that this should be taken metaphorically, as in the sense that God illuminates the world with understanding, rather than literally. The Andalusian scholar [[Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi]] categorized ''n\u016br''  into different levels of understanding from the most profound to the most mundane. [[Shia Islam|Shias]] believe ''n\u016br'', in the sense of inner esoteric understanding, is inherited through the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]], who in turn communicate it to the people.\n\n==Quran==\n\nThe word ''n\u016br'' comes from the same root as the Hebrew ''aor'', the primal light described in the [[Book of Genesis]] that was created at the beginning.{{sfn|Douglas-Klotz|2005|p=255}}\nThe word ''n\u016br'', or its derivatives, occurs forty-nine times in the Quran. It is used in reference to God, [[Muhammad]], the Quran, the Book, the Torah, the moon and the faithful men and women.\n''Al-nur'' is often used in combination with ''zulumat'' (darkness) in terms that describe movement from darkness into light, and from ignorance into faith.{{sfn|Fatani|2006|p=467}}\nThe word ''n\u016br'' is also used in eight basic referential meanings:{{sfn|Fatani|2006|p=468}}\n#The religion of Islam\n#Faith\n#God's commandments and moral laws in the Torah and the Gospels\n#The light of day\n#The guiding light that God will give to the faithful on the Day of Resurrection\n#The commandments and injunctions of the Quran\n#Justice\n#The light of the moon\n\nThe mystical ''[[An-Nur|Sura 24]]'' of the [[Quran]] contains the ''[[Ayat an-Nur]]'', the Verse of Light (Q24:35), which reads, \"God is the light of the heavens and the earth; the likeness of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp (the lamp in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star) kindled from a Blessed Tree, an olive that is neither of the East nor of the West whose oil well nigh would shine, even if no fire touched it; light upon light; (God guides to His light whom he will.)\"{{sfn|Irwin|2011|p=27-28}}\nThe phrase \"light upon light\" (''nurun 'ala nur'') in this ''sura'' is often used among Muslims to denote the infinite beauty, guidance and light of God.{{sfn|Fatani|2006|p=467}}\n\n==Classical commentaries==\n\nMost classical commentators other than Sufis took the statement \"God is the light of the heavens and the earth\" as a metaphor, and considered that God should not be literally equated with the natural phenomenon of light. [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] (839\u2013923) in his ''Jami al-bayan'' says that the best interpretation is to substitute \"guide\" for \"light\", as \"God is the guide of the heavens and the earth\". \nOther interpretations make God the source of illumination rather than the light itself, as \"God lights the heavens and the earth.{{sfn|Sands|2006|p=110}}\nThe Persian scholar [[Al-Zamakhshari]]  ({{circa|1074 \u20131144}}) says that the phrase \"God is the light\" is like saying \"Zayd is generous and munificent\". \nThis does not mean that Zayd is the properties of generosity and munificence, but that he has these properties.\nAl-Zamakhshari rejected the possibility of attributes separate from God, such as power or knowledge or light, which would be contrary to the unity of God.{{sfn|Sands|2006|p=110}}\nHe interpreted \"God is the light of the heavens and the earth\" as meaning,\n{{blockquote|He is the possessor of the light of the heavens and the owner of the light of the heavens. The light of the heavens and the earth is the truth (''[[Haqiqa|al-\u1e25aqq]]''), which can be compared to light in its manifestation and clarification, just as he says, \"God is the friend of those who believe; He brings them forth from the shadows to the light (2:257), i.e., from the false to the true (''al-\u1e25aqq'').{{sfn|Sands|2006|p=110}} }}\n\n[[Al-Ghazali]] ({{circa|1058\u20131111}}) wrote a treatise on how different types of light should be defined, and how the phrase \"God is the light of the heavens and the earth\" should be interpreted. In his view, \"light\" can have three different meanings. The first is the ordinary usage, \"an expression of what can be seen in itself and through which other things can be seen, like the sun\". In Arabic the word \"light\" may also refer to the eye, through which perception takes place, and this may be a more appropriate interpretation.{{sfn|Sands|2006|p=115}}\nThe \"eye\" of the intellect is an even more perfect organ of perception, and \"light\" may refer to this organ.\nIn this sense \"light\" may refer to Muhammad, and to a lesser extent to the other prophets and religious scholars.\nA third interpretation is that \"light\" is the first light (''al-n\u016br al-awwal'') and the real light (''al-n\u016br al-\u1e25aqq'') since it is the only light that does not take its luminosity from some other source. God is light, the only light, the universal light, and he is hidden from mortals because he is pure light, although he is omnipresent. \nUsing the term \"light\" for any other purpose is metaphor.{{sfn|Sands|2006|p=116}}\n\nAnother passage of the Quran states \"The earth will shine with the light of its Lord\" (Q39:69).\nMainstream [[exegete]]s take this statement literally. \nExegetes of the rationalist [[Mu'tazila]] school of theology of the 8th\u201310th centuries interpreted the word ''n\u016br'' in this passage in the sense of \"the truth, the Quran and the proof\" rather than the commonplace meaning of \"light\".{{sfn|Abdul-Raof|2012|p=36}}\nShia exegetes take it to mean \"the land of the soul will shine with the Lord's light of justice and truth during the time of Imam al-Mahdi.\"\nSufi exegetes take ''n\u016br'' in this case to mean \"justice\", or take the statement to mean \"God will create a special light to shine on the Earth\".{{sfn|Abdul-Raof|2012|p=148}}\n\n==Shia belief==\n\nThe adherents of [[Shia Islam]] believe that divine guidance continues to reach mankind through the progeny of Muhammad. \nThe Imams have the function of conveying the inner, esoteric understanding to mankind. According to Nadia Eboo Jamal, the Imams are \"the inheritors of his spiritual knowledge ('''ilm''), the bearers of the light (''n\u016br'') of God and His living proof (''hujjah'') on earth.\"{{sfn|Alibhai|2002|p=3}}\n\nAccording to the fifth Shiite Imam, [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the imams are the ''mu\u1e25addath\u016bn'' that are mentioned in the Quran, and are the light of God (''n\u016br All\u0101h'').{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=79}}\nHe was asked to comment on the Quranic verse Q64:8, \"And believe in Allah and His Messenger and the ''n\u016br'' (light) that We have brought down.\" He replied that the imams from the Prophet's family were in fact the light of God (''n\u016br Allah'') in the heavens and on earth. This spiritual light, passed down from one generation to the next, symbolizes the eternal knowledge that Muhammad passed on to [[Ali]] and his descendants.{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=80}}\n\nThere seem to be two concepts. The ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' is passed down through genealogical descent, while the ''n\u016br Allah'' is inherited at the time the previous possessor dies. \nThe imam has the ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' at birth, but is silent until he receives the ''n\u016br Allah''.{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=81}}\nThe ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' is the symbol of succession and the substance that connects Adam to Muhammad and Muhammad to the imams.\nThe ''n\u016br Allah'' is the symbol of prophecy, which the imams share with the prophets and all men chosen by God.{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=82}}\n\n==Sufi interpretation==\n\nTo the Sufis, ''n\u016br'' is the first creation of Allah, and all other things and beings were gradually created from it.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=72}}\nThe Andalusian scholar [[Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi]] (1076\u20131148)) elaborated the concept that Muhammad existed before creation.\nThis is the doctrine of ''An-N\u016br al-Mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'', or the Muhammadan Light. \nThe light existed before creation, and everything was created from it. \nThe world is a manifestation of the light, which was incarnated in Adam, the prophets and the ''Aq\u1e6d\u0101b''.{{sfn|Trimingham|1998|p=161}}\nIbn al-Arabi wrote, \"The creation began with ''n\u016br'' Muhammad. The lord brought the ''n\u016br'' from his own heart.\"{{sfn|Dehlvi|2012|p=54}}\nThe Persian poet and Sufi theoretician [[Fariduddin Attar]] ({{circa|1145\u20131221}}) wrote, \"The origin of the soul is the absolute light, nothing else. That means it was the light of Muhammad, nothing else.\"{{sfn|Dehlvi|2012|p=53}}\n\nTo the Sufis, light also represents what we know about our inner self, and darkness what we do not know.{{sfn|Douglas-Klotz|2005|p=253}}\nIbn Arabi distinguished three types of light: ''N\u00fbr al-anw\u00e2r'' (The Light of lights), which reveals the absolute reality in its most transcendent aspect, ''anw\u00e2r al-ma'\u00e2ni'' (The Light of the intellect) and ''anw\u00e2r al-tabi'\u00e2'' (The Light of nature).{{sfn|Yahya|1991|pp=35\u201344}}\nThe [[Iranian peoples|Persian]] philosopher [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155\u201391) wrote, \"Allah's essence is the original creative Light, always illuminating existence. It constantly manifests the universe and energizes it. Allah's Essential Light radiates the whole cosmos in abundant beauty and completeness. To be illuminated by this process means nothing less than salvation.\"{{sfn|Douglas-Klotz|2005|p=253}}\n\nMu\u1e25ammad ibn Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u00e1 Kh\u0101dim\u012b ({{circa|1702\u20131763}}) writes that, \"protecting the spiritual heart from worldly thoughts can be accomplished by the spiritual heart's benefiting (receiving \"Fayd\" (''n\u016br'' [light]) from the spiritual heart of the perfect Sufi master. The spiritual luminance (Fayd) flows from one spiritual heart to another by way of love. \nDeath of the perfect spiritual guide or his being in a distant country does not stop the flow of spiritual luminance (Fayd).\"{{sfn|Kh\u0101dim\u012b|2005|p=7}}\nAccording to [[Inayat Khan]] (1882\u20131927) the soul is like a ray of the sun.\nThe angels, who do not have physical bodies, are made of ''n\u016br'', or light, that comes from the divine Sun, the Spirit of God.\nAll souls are made of ''Nur'', or contain some part of that essence, which is the essence of the whole manifestation.{{sfn|Khan|2013|p=80}}\n\n==Medieval Bengal==\nHans Harder writes that in medieval Bengali Sufi cosmology the ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' is personified. \nThe ''n\u016br'', created by the lord, in turn brought the world into existence from drops of perspiration (gharma, gh\u0101m) that appeared in different parts of his body.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nHe says the concept is common in Maijbhandari writings, often used to describe the saints or their sensual qualities.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nGholan Morshed wrote an article that identified ''n\u016br'' with Muhammad.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nIn his ''Is'l\u0101m\u012b prabandha sambh\u0101r'' he wrote that ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' is the moving force behind all creation, and should not be seen as separate from Muhammad.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=75}} He wrote,\n{{blockquote|At the background [''ant\u0101ral''] of the creation, His [Muhammad's] ''n\u016br'', the ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'', is at play [''l\u012bl\u0101rta''] as the life-breath of the creation. This is the highest secret of the play of creation, full of science [''bij\u0148\u0101n'may'']. Therefore Muhammad is not any special person, not confined to any specific country, race [''j\u0101ti''] or by any border. In the form of ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'', He is qualified [''gu\u0146\u0101nvita''] by the same quality as Allah.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=75}} }}\n\nLutfunnesa Hosaini wrote a treatise ''T\u0101oh\u012bd'', part of which discusses the creation of the world from the time when ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' emerged to the time when [[Muhammad]] was born.\nShe writes that the ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' was divided into four parts. From the first three emerged the pen, the book of destinies and the throne. \nThe fourth part was divided into four. From the first three emerged the angels that held the throne, the seat of the throne, and all of the other angels.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nThe last part gave rise to the sky, the earth, heaven and hell, and to a part that then gave the light of the eyes of the believers, the light of their hearts, the light of the ''taw\u1e25\u012bd'' and the ''kalima''.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\n\nLutfunnesa Hosaini gives another account with reference to a Quranic commentary named ''Tafs\u012br-i r\u016b\u1e25 al-kit\u0101b''.\nIn this version ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' was also used to create the ''n\u016br'' of Adam, stored on his back.\nThe angels gathered behind Adam to see the light. Adam asked the Lord to put the light on his forehead, and the angels came round to where he could see them. Adam wanted to see the light himself, and the Lord transferred it to his index finger. When Adam came down to earth, lights entered his back again, and the ''n\u016br'' was then passed from Adam through the backs of various men and the wombs of women down to the parents of Muhammad.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=74}}\n\n==Modern Turkey==\n\n[[Said Nurs\u00ee]] founded the Nur movement in Turkey, stressing patience and spiritual withdrawal after the secularization program of the 1930s and 1940s had crushed revolt.{{sfn|Yavuz|2003|p=33}}\nThe adherents of the Nur movement and the Sufi orders in general consider that societal change will be enabled if individuals are redeemed. Negative feelings such as anger and shame should be controlled through inner mobilization.{{sfn|Yavuz|2003|p=30}}\nSaid Nurs\u00ee's textually-based Nurcu movement evolved from the Sufi orders. According to the Nurcu leader Mehmet K\u0131rk\u0131nc\u0131, \"the sun of Islam set down in 1925 and dawned in 1950 with the writings of Said, which enlighten the darkness of [[Kemalism]] with its light [nur].\"{{sfn|Yavuz|2003|p=57}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Yaqeen]]\n*[[Baqaa]]\n*[[Five Pure Lights|The five lights]] a similar concept\n\n==References==\n{{notes}}\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Abdul-Raof|first=Hussein|title=Theological Approaches to Qur'anic Exegesis: A Practical Comparative-contrastive Analysis\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjjcRAZQ1s4C&pg=PA36|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-44958-8}}\n*{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/SiteAssets/pdf/Surviving%20the%20Mongols.pdf|last=Alibhai|first=Fayaz S.|publisher=The Institute of Ismaili Studies|year=2002|title=Surviving the Mongols: Nizari Quhistani and the Continuity of Ismaili Tradition in Persia \u2013 A Reading Guide|accessdate=2014-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514154504/http://www.iis.ac.uk/SiteAssets/pdf/Surviving%20the%20Mongols.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-14|url-status=dead}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Dehlvi|first=Sadia|title=Sufism: Heart of Islam\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zw_Q2Rbh7yIC&pg=PT53|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |date=2012-09-05|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-93-5029-448-2}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Douglas-Klotz|first=Neil|title=The Sufi Book of Life: 99 Pathways of the Heart for the Modern Dervish\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOWLnAaP2zAC&pg=PA255|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |year=2005|publisher=Penguin Compass|isbn=978-0-14-219635-9}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Fatani|first=Afnan H.|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&pg=PA467|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-32639-1|chapter=NUR}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Harder|first=Hans|title=Sufism and Saint Veneration in Contemporary Bangladesh: The Maijbhandaris of Chittagong\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vSsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA72|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |date=2011-03-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83189-8}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Irwin|first=Robert|title=Memoirs of a Dervish: Sufis, Mystics and the Sixties\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrQLyh49XGcC&pg=PA27|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |date=2011-04-14|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=1-84765-404-5}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Kh\u0101dim\u012b|first=Mu\u1e25ammad|title=Ethics of Islam\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQP-Nhmq6VIC&pg=PA7|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2005|publisher=Hakikat Kitapevi|id=GGKEY:3HXN4S2CKUF}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Khan|first=Hazrat Inayat|title=The Heart of Sufism: Essential Writings of Hazrat Inayat Khan\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3N92HA0PJgC&pg=PT80|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |date=2013-07-02|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2874-2}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Lalani|first=Arzina R.|title=Early Shi'i Thought: The Teachings of Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gy8X3WK2h44C&pg=PA79|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-434-4}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Sands|first=Kristin|title=Sufi Commentaries on the Qur'an in Classical Islam\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uU9_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA110|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |date=2006-07-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-21144-9}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Trimingham|first= J.

God is light, the only light, the universal light, and he is hidden from mortals because he is pure light, although he is omnipresent. \nUsing the term \"light\" for any other purpose is metaphor.{{sfn|Sands|2006|p=116}}\n\nAnother passage of the Quran states \"The earth will shine with the light of its Lord\" (Q39:69).\nMainstream [[exegete]]s take this statement literally. \nExegetes of the rationalist [[Mu'tazila]] school of theology of the 8th\u201310th centuries interpreted the word ''n\u016br'' in this passage in the sense of \"the truth, the Quran and the proof\" rather than the commonplace meaning of \"light\".{{sfn|Abdul-Raof|2012|p=36}}\nShia exegetes take it to mean \"the land of the soul will shine with the Lord's light of justice and truth during the time of Imam al-Mahdi.\"\nSufi exegetes take ''n\u016br'' in this case to mean \"justice\", or take the statement to mean \"God will create a special light to shine on the Earth\".{{sfn|Abdul-Raof|2012|p=148}}\n\n==Shia belief==\n\nThe adherents of [[Shia Islam]] believe that divine guidance continues to reach mankind through the progeny of Muhammad. \nThe Imams have the function of conveying the inner, esoteric understanding to mankind. According to Nadia Eboo Jamal, the Imams are \"the inheritors of his spiritual knowledge ('''ilm''), the bearers of the light (''n\u016br'') of God and His living proof (''hujjah'') on earth.\"{{sfn|Alibhai|2002|p=3}}\n\nAccording to the fifth Shiite Imam, [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the imams are the ''mu\u1e25addath\u016bn'' that are mentioned in the Quran, and are the light of God (''n\u016br All\u0101h'').{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=79}}\nHe was asked to comment on the Quranic verse Q64:8, \"And believe in Allah and His Messenger and the ''n\u016br'' (light) that We have brought down.\" He replied that the imams from the Prophet's family were in fact the light of God (''n\u016br Allah'') in the heavens and on earth. This spiritual light, passed down from one generation to the next, symbolizes the eternal knowledge that Muhammad passed on to [[Ali]] and his descendants.{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=80}}\n\nThere seem to be two concepts. The ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' is passed down through genealogical descent, while the ''n\u016br Allah'' is inherited at the time the previous possessor dies. \nThe imam has the ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' at birth, but is silent until he receives the ''n\u016br Allah''.{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=81}}\nThe ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' is the symbol of succession and the substance that connects Adam to Muhammad and Muhammad to the imams.\nThe ''n\u016br Allah'' is the symbol of prophecy, which the imams share with the prophets and all men chosen by God.{{sfn|Lalani|2000|p=82}}\n\n==Sufi interpretation==\n\nTo the Sufis, ''n\u016br'' is the first creation of Allah, and all other things and beings were gradually created from it.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=72}}\nThe Andalusian scholar [[Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi]] (1076\u20131148)) elaborated the concept that Muhammad existed before creation.\nThis is the doctrine of ''An-N\u016br al-Mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'', or the Muhammadan Light. \nThe light existed before creation, and everything was created from it. \nThe world is a manifestation of the light, which was incarnated in Adam, the prophets and the ''Aq\u1e6d\u0101b''.{{sfn|Trimingham|1998|p=161}}\nIbn al-Arabi wrote, \"The creation began with ''n\u016br'' Muhammad. The lord brought the ''n\u016br'' from his own heart.\"{{sfn|Dehlvi|2012|p=54}}\nThe Persian poet and Sufi theoretician [[Fariduddin Attar]] ({{circa|1145\u20131221}}) wrote, \"The origin of the soul is the absolute light, nothing else. That means it was the light of Muhammad, nothing else.\"{{sfn|Dehlvi|2012|p=53}}\n\nTo the Sufis, light also represents what we know about our inner self, and darkness what we do not know.{{sfn|Douglas-Klotz|2005|p=253}}\nIbn Arabi distinguished three types of light: ''N\u00fbr al-anw\u00e2r'' (The Light of lights), which reveals the absolute reality in its most transcendent aspect, ''anw\u00e2r al-ma'\u00e2ni'' (The Light of the intellect) and ''anw\u00e2r al-tabi'\u00e2'' (The Light of nature).{{sfn|Yahya|1991|pp=35\u201344}}\nThe [[Persian]] philosopher [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155\u201391) wrote, \"Allah's essence is the original creative Light, always illuminating existence. It constantly manifests the universe and energizes it. Allah's Essential Light radiates the whole cosmos in abundant beauty and completeness. To be illuminated by this process means nothing less than salvation.\"{{sfn|Douglas-Klotz|2005|p=253}}\n\nMu\u1e25ammad ibn Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u00e1 Kh\u0101dim\u012b ({{circa|1702\u20131763}}) writes that, \"protecting the spiritual heart from worldly thoughts can be accomplished by the spiritual heart's benefiting (receiving \"Fayd\" (''n\u016br'' [light]) from the spiritual heart of the perfect Sufi master. The spiritual luminance (Fayd) flows from one spiritual heart to another by way of love. \nDeath of the perfect spiritual guide or his being in a distant country does not stop the flow of spiritual luminance (Fayd).\"{{sfn|Kh\u0101dim\u012b|2005|p=7}}\nAccording to [[Inayat Khan]] (1882\u20131927) the soul is like a ray of the sun.\nThe angels, who do not have physical bodies, are made of ''n\u016br'', or light, that comes from the divine Sun, the Spirit of God.\nAll souls are made of ''Nur'', or contain some part of that essence, which is the essence of the whole manifestation.{{sfn|Khan|2013|p=80}}\n\n==Medieval Bengal==\nHans Harder writes that in medieval Bengali Sufi cosmology the ''n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad'' is personified. \nThe ''n\u016br'', created by the lord, in turn brought the world into existence from drops of perspiration (gharma, gh\u0101m) that appeared in different parts of his body.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nHe says the concept is common in Maijbhandari writings, often used to describe the saints or their sensual qualities.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nGholan Morshed wrote an article that identified ''n\u016br'' with Muhammad.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nIn his ''Is'l\u0101m\u012b prabandha sambh\u0101r'' he wrote that ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' is the moving force behind all creation, and should not be seen as separate from Muhammad.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=75}} He wrote,\n{{blockquote|At the background [''ant\u0101ral''] of the creation, His [Muhammad's] ''n\u016br'', the ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'', is at play [''l\u012bl\u0101rta''] as the life-breath of the creation. This is the highest secret of the play of creation, full of science [''bij\u0148\u0101n'may'']. Therefore Muhammad is not any special person, not confined to any specific country, race [''j\u0101ti''] or by any border. In the form of ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'', He is qualified [''gu\u0146\u0101nvita''] by the same quality as Allah.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=75}} }}\n\nLutfunnesa Hosaini wrote a treatise ''T\u0101oh\u012bd'', part of which discusses the creation of the world from the time when ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' emerged to the time when [[Muhammad]] was born.\nShe writes that the ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' was divided into four parts. From the first three emerged the pen, the book of destinies and the throne. \nThe fourth part was divided into four. From the first three emerged the angels that held the throne, the seat of the throne, and all of the other angels.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\nThe last part gave rise to the sky, the earth, heaven and hell, and to a part that then gave the light of the eyes of the believers, the light of their hearts, the light of the ''taw\u1e25\u012bd'' and the ''kalima''.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=73}}\n\nLutfunnesa Hosaini gives another account with reference to a Quranic commentary named ''Tafs\u012br-i r\u016b\u1e25 al-kit\u0101b''.\nIn this version ''n\u016br-i mu\u1e25ammad\u012b'' was also used to create the ''n\u016br'' of Adam, stored on his back.\nThe angels gathered behind Adam to see the light. Adam asked the Lord to put the light on his forehead, and the angels came round to where he could see them. Adam wanted to see the light himself, and the Lord transferred it to his index finger. When Adam came down to earth, lights entered his back again, and the ''n\u016br'' was then passed from Adam through the backs of various men and the wombs of women down to the parents of Muhammad.{{sfn|Harder|2011|p=74}}\n\n==Modern Turkey==\n\n[[Said Nurs\u00ee]] founded the Nur movement in Turkey, stressing patience and spiritual withdrawal after the secularization program of the 1930s and 1940s had crushed revolt.{{sfn|Yavuz|2003|p=33}}\nThe adherents of the Nur movement and the Sufi orders in general consider that societal change will be enabled if individuals are redeemed. Negative feelings such as anger and shame should be controlled through inner mobilization.{{sfn|Yavuz|2003|p=30}}\nSaid Nurs\u00ee's textually-based Nurcu movement evolved from the Sufi orders. According to the Nurcu leader Mehmet K\u0131rk\u0131nc\u0131, \"the sun of Islam set down in 1925 and dawned in 1950 with the writings of Said, which enlighten the darkness of [[Kemalism]] with its light [nur].\"{{sfn|Yavuz|2003|p=57}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Yaqeen]]\n*[[Baqaa]]\n*[[Five Pure Lights|The five lights]] a similar concept\n\n==References==\n{{notes}}\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Abdul-Raof|first=Hussein|title=Theological Approaches to Qur'anic Exegesis: A Practical Comparative-contrastive Analysis\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjjcRAZQ1s4C&pg=PA36|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-44958-8}}\n*{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/SiteAssets/pdf/Surviving%20the%20Mongols.pdf|last=Alibhai|first=Fayaz S.|publisher=The Institute of Ismaili Studies|year=2002|title=Surviving the Mongols: Nizari Quhistani and the Continuity of Ismaili Tradition in Persia \u2013 A Reading Guide|accessdate=2014-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514154504/http://www.iis.ac.uk/SiteAssets/pdf/Surviving%20the%20Mongols.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-14|url-status=dead}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Dehlvi|first=Sadia|title=Sufism: Heart of Islam\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zw_Q2Rbh7yIC&pg=PT53|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |date=2012-09-05|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-93-5029-448-2}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Douglas-Klotz|first=Neil|title=The Sufi Book of Life: 99 Pathways of the Heart for the Modern Dervish\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOWLnAaP2zAC&pg=PA255|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |year=2005|publisher=Penguin Compass|isbn=978-0-14-219635-9}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Fatani|first=Afnan H.|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&pg=PA467|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-32639-1|chapter=NUR}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Harder|first=Hans|title=Sufism and Saint Veneration in Contemporary Bangladesh: The Maijbhandaris of Chittagong\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vSsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA72|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |date=2011-03-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83189-8}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Irwin|first=Robert|title=Memoirs of a Dervish: Sufis, Mystics and the Sixties\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrQLyh49XGcC&pg=PA27|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |date=2011-04-14|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=1-84765-404-5}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Kh\u0101dim\u012b|first=Mu\u1e25ammad|title=Ethics of Islam\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQP-Nhmq6VIC&pg=PA7|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2005|publisher=Hakikat Kitapevi|id=GGKEY:3HXN4S2CKUF}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Khan|first=Hazrat Inayat|title=The Heart of Sufism: Essential Writings of Hazrat Inayat Khan\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3N92HA0PJgC&pg=PT80|accessdate=2014-12-14\n |date=2013-07-02|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2874-2}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Lalani|first=Arzina R.|title=Early Shi'i Thought: The Teachings of Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gy8X3WK2h44C&pg=PA79|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |year=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-434-4}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Sands|first=Kristin|title=Sufi Commentaries on the Qur'an in Classical Islam\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uU9_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA110|accessdate=2014-12-15\n |date=2006-07-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-21144-9}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Trimingham|first= J.
