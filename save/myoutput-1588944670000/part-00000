After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1983. The band then released the album ''[[Diamond Life]]'' a year later, which became one of the best-selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist. It also gained widespread critical acclaim and is included in the reference book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Robert Dimery|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse/page/518 518]|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=9781844036240|url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse/page/518}}</ref> In July 1985, Sade was among the performers at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. In late 1985, they released ''[[Promise (Sade album)|Promise]]'', which was also a resounding critical and commercial success, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]] and becoming the band's first album to debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It later earned quadruple platinum certification in the U.S., and reached platinum across Europe. It also earned the group the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1986. Their following two releases, 1988's ''[[Stronger Than Pride]]'' and 1992's ''[[Love Deluxe]]'', were also critically and commercially successful; however, the band would go on hiatus after the birth of Sade's child, while the singer experienced widespread media coverage during the period for unsubstantiated claims of [[Major depressive disorder|mental health]] and [[addiction]] issues.\n\nAfter a spell of eight years without an album, which came after Sade appeared in the film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986), the band reunited in 1999, and released ''[[Lovers Rock (Sade album)|Lovers Rock]]'' in 2000. The album departed from the jazz-inspired inflections of their previous work, featuring mellower sounds and pop compositions, and was critically praised, earning the group the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. The band would then undergo another term of hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]''. The album was another commercial success, although critical reception remained divided, but won the group the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. Following the album's release, the band entered a third period of hiatus, and have only released two new songs (2018's \"[[Flower of the Universe]]\" for the soundtrack of Disney's ''[[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|A Wrinkle in Time]]'' and \"The Big Unknown\", part of the soundtrack for Steve McQueen's film ''Widows'') to date.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/07/you-can-now-listen-to-sades-first-new-song-in-seven-years-flower-of-the-universe/?noredirect=on \"You can now listen to Sade's first new song in seven years, 'Flower of the Universe' \"].

After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1983. The band then released the album ''[[Diamond Life]]'' a year later, which became one of the best-selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist. It also gained widespread critical acclaim and is included in the reference book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Robert Dimery|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse/page/518 518]|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=9781844036240|url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse/page/518}}</ref> In July 1985, Sade was among the performers at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. In late 1985, they released ''[[Promise (Sade album)|Promise]]'', which was also a resounding critical and commercial success, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]] and becoming the band's first album to debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It later earned quadruple platinum certification in the U.S., and reached platinum across Europe. It also earned the group the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1986. Their following two releases, 1988's ''[[Stronger Than Pride]]'' and 1992's ''[[Love Deluxe]]'', were also critically and commercially successful; however, the band would go on hiatus after the birth of Sade's child, while the singer experienced widespread media coverage during the period for unsubstantiated claims of [[Major depressive disorder|mental health]] and [[addiction]] issues.\n\nAfter a spell of eight years without an album, which came after Sade appeared in the film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986), the band reunited in 1999, and released ''[[Lovers Rock (Sade album)|Lovers Rock]]'' in 2000. The album departed from the jazz-inspired inflections of their previous work, featuring mellower sounds and pop compositions, and was critically praised, earning the group the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. The band would then undergo another term of hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]''. The album was another commercial success, although critical reception remained divided, but won the group the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. Following the album's release, the band entered a third period of hiatus, and have only released two new songs (2018's \"[[Flower of the Universe]]\" for the soundtrack of Disney's ''[[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|A Wrinkle in Time]]'' and \"The Big Unknown\", part of the soundtrack for Steve McQueen's film ''Widows'') to date.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/07/you-can-now-listen-to-sades-first-new-song-in-seven-years-flower-of-the-universe/?noredirect=on \"You can now listen to Sade's first new song in seven years, 'Flower of the Universe' \"].
