{"title_page": "Subtle realism", "text_new": "'''Subtle realism''' is a distinctive philosophical position within social science that, along with other forms of [[Philosophical realism|realism]], stands opposed to various kinds of [[relativism]] and [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]].

As this suggests, the philosophical position to which the term 'subtle realism' refers is by no means entirely novel. For example, key elements of it can be found in [[Susan Haack]]'s book ''Evidence and Inquiry'', and in her other writings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Haack|first=Susan|title=Evidence and Inquiry: A pragmatist reconstruction, Second edition|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2009|isbn=|location=Amherst NY|pages=}}</ref> And Haack, like Hammersley, draws on the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].\n\nMany qualitative researchers are strongly opposed to the epistemological, ontological, and/or axiological assumptions taken to be characteristic of quantitative method, these usually given the label '[[positivism]]'. However, there were diverse philosophical influences on qualitative work, ranging through [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[hermeneutics]], [[Critical theory|Critical Theory,]] and '[[postmodernism]]'. As a result, over time, multiple forms of [[qualitative research]] arose that were in contention with one another; indeed, their advocates often accused one another of positivism. In the process, the meaning of this term shifted. Initially, it was the idea that social phenomena can only be understood scientifically through measuring and controlling variables on the basis of observable data, with the aim of discovering scientific laws. Subsequently, 'positivism' was often treated as simply the belief that the task of research is to document ''facts'' about social phenomena, these phenomena being assumed to exist independently of any investigation of them. In other words, the meaning of 'positivism' came to be conflated with that of 'realism'. Also rejected by many qualitative researchers was the idea that phenomena can only be documented accurately through a commitment to [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]];<ref>Hammersley, M. \u2018Objectivity: a reconceptualisation\u2019, in Williams, M. and Vogt, P. (eds.) ''The Sage Handbook of Methodological Innovation'', London, Sage, 2011.</ref> which they interpreted as the effort to eliminate, or at least minimise, the influence on the process of inquiry of the value-commitments, prior assumptions, and social/personal characteristics of the researcher. Many qualitative researchers thus came to deny that there can be a single reality, one that exists independently of particular perspectives. They argued that we could never gain direct knowledge of such a reality, that all 'contact' with it would rely on prior assumptions and be shaped by the characteristics of the researcher and the research process. Therefore, they insisted that reality is always constructed on the basis of some perspective; and that, since there are multiple perspectives relying on discrepant assumptions, there are multiple 'realities': incommensurable experiential worlds among which there can be no adjudication because we cannot have unmediated access to 'things-in-themselves'. This line of argument drew especially on work concerned with the role of metaphysical assumptions in natural science, notably [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'',<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> though key elements can be traced back to [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian philosophy]].<ref>Heis, Jeremy, \"Neo-Kantianism\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2018 Edition), Edward N.

One version of this treats these perspectives as capturing important aspects of human reality, an idea anticipated in the nineteenth century by [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]] who 'argued for a revised notion of objectivity, contending that historical understanding draws on the same imaginative capacities that enables poets to transcend the limits of their own sociohistorical conditions'.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Owensby|first=Jacob|title=Dilthey and the Narrative of History|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Ithaca NY|pages=x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Ermarth|first=M.|title=Wilhelm Dilthey: the critique of historical reason|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}</ref> However, as already noted, often the idea that there is a reality beyond particular perspectives was rejected; and this led to proposals that research accounts should be judged not in terms of their correspondence to 'reality', but according to their usefulness in practical terms, their political implications (for example whether they challenge 'social inequality'), their aesthetic qualities, or their psychological value, in the sense of whether they are inspiring, uplifting or facilitate human solidarity.

It asserts that there is a single reality (not multiple realities corresponding to different perspectives); that the researcher is part of this reality not separate from or above it; that it is possible to gain knowledge of the phenomena that make up this reality, but that beliefs cannot be ''logically'' derived from, or proven absolutely via, sense impressions or any other kind of immediately given data; that a distinction must be drawn between what is true and what can be believed with justification, the latter being decided on the basis of what is beyond reasonable doubt; and that any understanding or knowledge produced comprises answers to particular questions about the phenomena, rather than capturing those phenomena 'in themselves' \u2013 in other words, it cannot simply reproduce them.\n\nIn more detail, subtle realism has the following components:\n\n# ''The nature of knowledge''. While 'knowledge' is an achievement term (to say that someone knows something is to say both that he or she believes it ''and'' that it is true), this does not mean that the word 'knowledge' can only be applied to beliefs whose validity is beyond all possible doubt. In its normal usage we say something is true if we judge it to be beyond reasonable doubt. This implies accepting that all beliefs are fallible: they may turn out to be false despite a previous judgment having been justified that they were true. However, this does not mean that they are all equally likely to be false. Crucial here, then, is a rejection of the idea that what is true must be beyond all possible doubt, and a distinction between what is true and what one is justified in believing at any point in time. The idea that we must rely on what is beyond reasonable doubt is derived from [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s critique of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Almeder|first=R.|title=The Philosophy of Charles S. Peirce|publisher=Blackwell|year=1980|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref> But also implied here is that the threshold appropriate for determining what is reasonable, and therefore what it is justifiable to believe, can vary across activities and contexts, partly depending on the relative cost of false positives and false negatives.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hammersley|first=Martyn|title=Methodology, Who Needs It?|publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=|location=London|pages=ch5}}</ref>\n# ''The process of gaining knowledge.'' Deciding what is beyond reasonable doubt involves assessing, first of all, the relationship between a knowledge claim and what is already taken to be well-established knowledge (Does it follow logically from this?, Is it more weakly implied by this?, Is it compatible with this?, Is it at odds with this?) (Hammersley calls this 'plausibility');<ref>Hammersley, M. (1992) ''What's Wrong with Ethnography?'', London, Routledge, ch4</ref> and, second, with how the knowledge claim was produced, specifically what were the chances of error in its production (the label given to this is 'credibility'). Faced with a knowledge claim that is neither sufficiently plausible nor credible, determining its likely truth depends upon the evidence available to support it, this evidence, in turn, being judged as regards ''its'' plausibility and credibility. Besides the search for evidence, further information may also be sought about how the knowledge claim, or relevant evidence, was produced so as to have better grounds for assessing its credibility. To use a commonplace example from detective stories, a witness claims to have seen someone murdered. A first basis for judging this is whether or not the allegedly murdered person is known to be still alive (if so, the claim is very implausible, unless we believe in resurrection). If the person concerned has disappeared, then the claim that murder has taken place is compatible with what is known, so this provides a relatively weak degree of plausibility; finding the body would increase this. To strengthen the basis for making a judgment about who was the killer it is necessary to make sure that the witness was where he or she claimed to have seen the murder; had a clear view of what went on; that what was seen is strongly indicative of murder; and so on. In seeking further evidence we may want information about the witness (how good is the eyesight, does he or she have any reason to lie, etc.), facts about the scene, or testimony from other witnesses. In this way a case can be built for concluding that a murder took place and who did it, that it did not take place, or that the validity of the witness's statement remains uncertain. Nevertheless, any claim about the murder remains fallible, even if it is beyond reasonable doubt.\n# ''The relationship between inquiry and reality''. All knowledge is constructed, and is never solely a matter of strictly logical inference from given data but rather involves imagination and ampliative inference (inference where the conclusion reached is not already contained in the starting assumptions).<ref>Hintikka, Jaakko J. (2020) 'Logic', ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Available at: <nowiki>https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic</nowiki></ref> As a result, it is recognised that prior assumptions and commitments can lead to insights, but subtle realists insist that these can also lead to error and that this tendency must be controlled. They also argue that there is only one reality, and that reality is simply 'what is there' \u2013 it is not an object in the world. Furthermore, generally speaking, the phenomena investigated are independent of the researcher and the process of inquiry, in the sense that making a knowledge claim, or engaging in inquiry about some set of phenomena, does not in itself change those phenomena, thereby determining what is true or false. However, the task of research is not to reproduce these phenomena as they are, to represent them 'in their own terms', or in terms of their essential character, but rather to answer questions (implicit or explicit) about them. So, the knowledge produced comprises answers to those questions. This means that there can be multiple, non-contradictory descriptions and explanations of the same phenomenon, depending on what questions about it are being addressed. In this sense there can be, and indeed usually are, multiple perspectives, even though there is a single reality.\n\nThe implications of subtle realism for research are that scientific investigation of social phenomena is possible and desirable; and that it is quite distinct from, even though it shares some characteristics with, the production of literary or artistic fictions, the pursuit of practical or political goals, and the realisation of ethical ideals. Equally important, it does not differ fundamentally in character from the ordinary inquiry and sense-making we all engage in during the course of everyday life; though the questions it addresses are usually much more difficult to answer than mundane ones, and it employs refined methods designed to tackle those questions.<ref>Seale, C.(1999) ''The Quality of Qualitative Research.''London: Sage.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Philosophical realism]]\n", "text_old": "'''Subtle realism''' is a distinctive philosophical position within social science that, along with other forms of [[Philosophical realism|realism]], stands opposed to various kinds of [[relativism]] and [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]].

Furthermore, generally speaking, the phenomena investigated are independent of the researcher and the process of inquiry, in the sense that making a knowledge claim, or engaging in inquiry about some set of phenomena, does not in itself change those phenomena, thereby determining what is true or false. However, the task of research is not to reproduce these phenomena as they are, to represent them 'in their own terms', or in terms of their essential character, but rather to answer questions (implicit or explicit) about them. So, the knowledge produced comprises answers to those questions. This means that there can be multiple, non-contradictory descriptions and explanations of the same phenomenon, depending on what questions about it are being addressed. In this sense there can be, and indeed usually are, multiple perspectives, even though there is a single reality.\n\nThe implications of subtle realism for research are that scientific investigation of social phenomena is possible and desirable; and that it is quite distinct from, even though it shares some characteristics with, the production of literary or artistic fictions, the pursuit of practical or political goals, and the realisation of ethical ideals. Equally important, it does not differ fundamentally in character from the ordinary inquiry and sense-making we all engage in during the course of everyday life; though the questions it addresses are usually much more difficult to answer than mundane ones, and it employs refined methods designed to tackle those questions.<ref>Seale, C.(1999) ''The Quality of Qualitative Research.''London: Sage.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n[[Category:Philosophical realism]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: Subsequently \u2192 Subsequently,, etc) \u2192 etc.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtle_realism"}
