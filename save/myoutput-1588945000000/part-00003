Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and [[En-suite|en-suite bathroom]]s. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually [[Room number|numbered]] (or named in some smaller hotels and [[Bed and breakfast|B&Bs]]) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In [[Japan]], [[capsule hotel]]s provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.\n\nThe precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]]. For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travelers. Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in [[Exeter]] in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.\n\nHotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel facility offers [[Luxury goods|luxury]] amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site [[restaurant]], and the highest level of personalized service, such as a [[concierge]], [[room service]], and clothes pressing staff. [[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often contain upscale full-service facilities with many full-service accommodations, an on-site full-service [[restaurant]], and a variety of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. [[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities. Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. [[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.\n\n[[Timeshare]] and [[destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. A [[motel]] is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. [[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting. A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]]. Some hotels are built specifically as destinations in themselves, for example [[casino]]s and holiday [[resort]]s.\n\nMost hotel establishments are run by a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the \"[[Hotel manager|Hotel Manager]]\"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''hotel'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''h\u00f4tel'' (coming from the same origin as ''[[hospital]]''), which referred to a French version of a building seeing frequent visitors, and providing care, rather than a place offering accommodation. In contemporary French usage, ''h\u00f4tel'' now has the same meaning as the English term, and ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier]]'' is used for the old meaning, as well as \"h\u00f4tel\" in some place names such as [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Paris|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]] (in Paris), which has been a hospital since the [[Middle Ages]]. The French spelling, with the [[circumflex]], was also used in English, but is now rare. The circumflex replaces the 's' found in the earlier ''[[hostel]]'' spelling, which over time took on a new, but closely related meaning. Grammatically, hotels usually take the [[definite article]] \u2013 hence \"The Astoria Hotel\" or simply \"The Astoria.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tabard inn mid19th.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Tabard Inn, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark, London]]]]\nFacilities offering hospitality to travellers have been a feature of the earliest civilizations. In [[Greco-Roman culture]] and [[ancient Persia]], hospitals for recuperation and rest were built at [[thermal bath]]s. Japan's [[Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan]], founded in 705, was officially recognised by the [[Guinness World Records]] as the oldest hotel in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Oldest hotel|url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-hotel|accessdate = 2015-04-04|publisher = Guinness World Records}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], various religious orders at [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s would offer accommodation for travellers on the road.\n\nThe precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]], possibly dating back to the rule of [[Ancient Rome]]. These would provide for the needs of travellers, including food and lodging, [[Stable|stabling]] and [[fodder]] for the traveller's horse(s) and fresh horses for the [[mail coach]]. Famous London examples of inns include the [[The George, Southwark|George]] and the [[The Tabard|Tabard]]. A typical layout of an inn had an inner court with bedrooms on the two sides, with the [[kitchen]] and [[parlour]] at the front and the stables at the back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4017990.html|title=Hotels: A Brief History |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nFor a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travellers (in other words, a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]). Coaching [[inn]]s stabled teams of [[horse]]s for [[stagecoach]]es and [[mail coach]]es and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart, but this depended very much on the terrain.\n\n[[File:TremontHouse ca1830s byJamesBennett Boston SimonsUPNE.png|thumb|right|[[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] in [[Boston]], United States, a luxury hotel, the first to provide indoor plumbing]]\nSome [[England|English]] towns had as many as ten such [[inn]]s and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the wealthy passengers. By the end of the century, coaching inns were being run more professionally, with a regular timetable being followed and fixed menus for food.<ref>Coaching Era, The: ''Stage and Mail Coach Travel in and Around Bath, Bristol and Somerset'', Roy Gallop, Fiducia  (2003), {{ISBN|1-85026-019-2}}</ref>\n\nInns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in grandeur and the level of service provided. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was [[Royal Clarence Hotel|opened]] in [[Exeter]] in 1768, although the idea only really caught on in the early 19th century. In 1812, Mivart's Hotel opened its doors in [[London]], later changing its name to [[Claridge's]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/buildings/inns.shtml|title=Researching the history of pubs, inns and hotels|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nHotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century. Luxury hotels, including the 1829 [[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] in [[Boston]], the 1836 [[Astor House]] in [[New York City]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles25/hotels-12.shtml |title=Nineteenth Century Hotels In The United States|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref> the 1889 [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and the [[C\u00e9sar Ritz|Ritz chain of hotels]] in London and [[Paris]] in the late 1890s, catered to an ever more wealthy clientele.\n\n==International scale==\nHotels cater to travelers from many countries and languages, since no one country dominates the travel industry.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Most hotels and major hospitality companies that operate hotels have set widely accepted industry standards to classify hotel types. General categories include the following:\n\n==={{anchor|Luxury}}International luxury===\n[[File:H\u00f4tel George-V 25 08 2007 n3.jpg|thumb|[[Four Seasons Hotel George V]] in [[Paris]], France]]\n[[Image:Mandarin_Oriental_Bangkok_Exec_Suite.jpg|thumb|[[Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok]], Thailand]]\nInternational luxury hotels offer high quality amenities, full service accommodations, on-site full-service restaurants, and the highest level of personalized and professional service in major or capital cities. International luxury hotels are classified with at least a [[AAA Five Diamond Award|Five Diamond]] rating or [[Star (classification)|Five Star]] [[hotel rating]] depending on the country and local classification standards. ''Examples include: [[Grand Hyatt]], [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad]], [[InterContinental Hotels & Resorts|InterContinental]], [[Sofitel]], [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]], [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]], [[The Peninsula Hotels|The Peninsula]], [[Rosewood Hotels & Resorts|Rosewood]], [[JW Marriott Hotels|JW Marriott]] and [[The Ritz-Carlton]].''\n\n==={{anchor|Lifestyle}}Lifestyle luxury resorts===\n[[File:Main swimming pool, Shangri-La Fijian Resort.jpg|thumb|[[Shangri-La's Fijian Resort]] in [[Yanuca]] Island, Fiji]]\n[[Image:Wild-wadi.jpg|thumb|[[Jumeirah Beach Hotel]] in [[Dubai]], United Arab Emirates]]\nLifestyle luxury [[resorts]] are branded hotels that appeal to a guest with lifestyle or personal image in specific locations. They are typically full-service and classified as luxury. A key characteristic of lifestyle resorts is focus on providing a unique guest experience as opposed to simply providing lodging. Normally, lifestyle resorts are classified with a Five Star hotel rating depending on the country and local classification standards. Examples include: [[Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts|Waldorf Astoria]], [[St. Regis Hotels & Resorts|St. Regis]], [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Shangri-La]], [[The Oberoi Group|Oberoi]], [[Belmond Limited|Belmond]], [[Jumeirah (hotel chain)|Jumeirah]], [[Aman Resorts|Aman]], [[Taj Hotels]], [[Hoshino Resorts|Hoshino]], [[Raffles Hotels & Resorts|Raffles]], [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]], [[Banyan Tree Holdings|Banyan Tree]], [[Regent Hotels & Resorts|Regent]] and [[Park Hyatt]].\n\n==={{anchor|Full}}Upscale full-service===\n[[Conference and resort hotels|Upscale full service hotels]] often provide a wide array of guest services and on-site facilities. Commonly found amenities may include: on-site food and beverage (room service and restaurants), meeting and conference services and facilities, fitness center, and business center. Upscale full-service hotels range in quality from upscale to luxury.  This classification is based upon the quality of facilities and amenities offered by the hotel.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Full-Service Vs.

These hotels are generally 100 rooms or fewer.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hvs.com/Content/3171.pdf|title = Boutique Hotels Segment|last = Balekjian|first = Cristina|date = September 2011|journal = HVS|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Focused}}Focused or select service===\nSmall to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a limited number of on-site amenities that only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the single business traveler. Most focused or select service hotels may still offer full service accommodations but may lack leisure amenities such as an on-site restaurant or a swimming pool. Examples include [[Hyatt Place]], [[Holiday Inn]], [[Courtyard by Marriott]] and [[Hilton Garden Inn]].\n\n==={{anchor|Economy}}Economy and limited service===\nSmall to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a very limited number of on-site amenities and often only offer basic accommodations with little to no services, these facilities normally only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the budget-minded traveler seeking a \"no frills\" accommodation. Limited service hotels often lack an on-site restaurant but in return may offer a limited complimentary food and beverage amenity such as on-site continental breakfast service.  Examples include [[Ibis Budget]], [[Hampton Inn]], [[Aloft Hotels|Aloft]], [[Holiday Inn Express]], [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn]], [[Four Points by Sheraton]].\n\n==={{anchor|Extended}}Extended stay===\n[[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel. Extended stay hotels may offer non-traditional pricing methods such as a weekly rate that caters towards travelers in need of short-term accommodations for an extended period of time. Similar to limited and select service hotels, on-site amenities are normally limited and most extended stay hotels lack an on-site restaurant. Examples include [[Staybridge Suites]], [[Candlewood Suites]], [[Homewood Suites by Hilton]], [[Home2 Suites by Hilton]], [[Residence Inn by Marriott]], [[Element by Westin|Element]], and [[Extended Stay America]].\n\n==={{anchor|Timeshare}}Timeshare and destination clubs===\n[[Timeshare]] and [[Destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership also referred to as a vacation ownership involving the purchase and ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage during a specified period of time. Timeshare resorts often offer amenities similar that of a Full service hotel with on-site restaurant(s), swimming pools, recreation grounds, and other leisure-oriented amenities. Destination clubs on the other hand may offer more exclusive private accommodations such as private houses in a neighborhood-style setting. Examples of timeshare brands include [[Hilton Grand Vacations]], [[Marriott Vacation Club International]], [[Westgate Resorts]], [[Disney Vacation Club]], and [[Holiday Inn|Holiday Inn Club Vacations]].\n\n==={{anchor|Motel}}Motel===\nA [[motel]], an abbreviation for \"motor hotel\", is a small-sized low-rise lodging establishment similar to a limited service, lower-cost hotel, but typically with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. Motels were built to serve road travellers, including travellers on road trip vacations and workers who drive for their job (travelling salespeople, truck drivers, etc.). Common during the 1950s and 1960s, motels were often located adjacent to a major highway, where they were built on inexpensive land at the edge of towns or along stretches of freeway.\n\nNew motel construction is rare in the 2000s as hotel chains have been building economy-priced, limited service franchised properties at freeway exits which compete for largely the same clientele, largely saturating the market by the 1990s. Motels are still useful in less populated areas for driving travelers, but the more populated an area becomes, the more hotels move in to meet the demand for accommodation. While many motels are unbranded and independent, many of the other motels which remain in operation joined national franchise chains, often rebranding themselves as hotels, inns or lodges.  Some examples of chains with motels include [[EconoLodge]], [[Motel 6]], [[Super 8 Motels|Super 8]], and [[Travelodge]].\n\nMotels in some parts of the world are more often regarded as places for romantic assignations where rooms are often rented by the hour. This is fairly common in parts of [[Latin America]].\n\n==={{anchor|Microstay}}Microstay===\nHotels may offer rooms for [[microstay]]s,<ref>{{cite news|title=By-the-Hour Microstays Add to Big Hotels' Bottom Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/business/a-room-by-the-hour-to-refresh.html|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> a type of booking for less than 24 hours where the customer chooses the check in time and the length of the stay.

Degree programs such as [[hospitality management studies]], a [[business degree]], and/or certification programs formally prepare hotel managers for industry practice.\n\nMost hotel establishments consist of a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the \"Hotel Manager\"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel, [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.\n\n=={{anchor|Unique}}Unique and specialty hotels==\n\n=== {{anchor|Historic}} Historic inns and boutique hotels ===\n[[File:Hotel Astoria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]] and statue of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia]]\n[[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.\nSome hotels have gained their renown through tradition, by hosting significant events or persons, such as Schloss [[Cecilienhof]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], which derives its fame from the [[Potsdam Conference]] of the [[World War II]] allies [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Schloss Cecilienhof - Cecilienhof Palace |url=http://www.potsdam.de/node/276259 |work=Landeshauptstadt Potsdam |access-date=23 October 2015}}</ref> The [[Taj Mahal Palace & Tower]] in [[Mumbai]] is one of India's most famous and historic hotels because of its association with the [[Indian independence movement]].

Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and [[En-suite|en-suite bathroom]]s. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually [[Room number|numbered]] (or named in some smaller hotels and [[Bed and breakfast|B&Bs]]) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In [[Japan]], [[capsule hotel]]s provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.\n\nThe precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]]. For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travelers. Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in [[Exeter]] in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.\n\nHotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel facility offers [[Luxury goods|luxury]] amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site [[restaurant]], and the highest level of personalized service, such as a [[concierge]], [[room service]], and clothes pressing staff. [[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often contain upscale full-service facilities with many full-service accommodations, an on-site full-service [[restaurant]], and a variety of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. [[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities. Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. [[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.\n\n[[Timeshare]] and [[destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. A [[motel]] is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. [[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting. A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]]. Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself, for example at [[casino]]s and holiday [[resort]]s.\n\nMost hotel establishments are run by a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the \"[[Hotel manager|Hotel Manager]]\"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''hotel'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''h\u00f4tel'' (coming from the same origin as ''[[hospital]]''), which referred to a French version of a building seeing frequent visitors, and providing care, rather than a place offering accommodation. In contemporary French usage, ''h\u00f4tel'' now has the same meaning as the English term, and ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier]]'' is used for the old meaning, as well as \"h\u00f4tel\" in some place names such as [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Paris|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]] (in Paris), which has been a hospital since the [[Middle Ages]]. The French spelling, with the [[circumflex]], was also used in English, but is now rare. The circumflex replaces the 's' found in the earlier ''[[hostel]]'' spelling, which over time took on a new, but closely related meaning. Grammatically, hotels usually take the [[definite article]] \u2013 hence \"The Astoria Hotel\" or simply \"The Astoria.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tabard inn mid19th.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Tabard Inn, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark, London]]]]\nFacilities offering hospitality to travellers have been a feature of the earliest civilizations. In [[Greco-Roman culture]] and [[ancient Persia]], hospitals for recuperation and rest were built at [[thermal bath]]s. Japan's [[Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan]], founded in 705, was officially recognised by the [[Guinness World Records]] as the oldest hotel in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Oldest hotel|url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-hotel|accessdate = 2015-04-04|publisher = Guinness World Records}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], various religious orders at [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s would offer accommodation for travellers on the road.\n\nThe precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]], possibly dating back to the rule of [[Ancient Rome]]. These would provide for the needs of travellers, including food and lodging, [[Stable|stabling]] and [[fodder]] for the traveller's horse(s) and fresh horses for the [[mail coach]]. Famous London examples of inns include the [[The George, Southwark|George]] and the [[The Tabard|Tabard]]. A typical layout of an inn had an inner court with bedrooms on the two sides, with the [[kitchen]] and [[parlour]] at the front and the stables at the back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4017990.html|title=Hotels: A Brief History |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nFor a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travellers (in other words, a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]). Coaching [[inn]]s stabled teams of [[horse]]s for [[stagecoach]]es and [[mail coach]]es and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart, but this depended very much on the terrain.\n\n[[File:TremontHouse ca1830s byJamesBennett Boston SimonsUPNE.png|thumb|right|[[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] in [[Boston]], United States, a luxury hotel, the first to provide indoor plumbing]]\nSome [[England|English]] towns had as many as ten such [[inn]]s and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the wealthy passengers. By the end of the century, coaching inns were being run more professionally, with a regular timetable being followed and fixed menus for food.<ref>Coaching Era, The: ''Stage and Mail Coach Travel in and Around Bath, Bristol and Somerset'', Roy Gallop, Fiducia  (2003), {{ISBN|1-85026-019-2}}</ref>\n\nInns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in grandeur and the level of service provided. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was [[Royal Clarence Hotel|opened]] in [[Exeter]] in 1768, although the idea only really caught on in the early 19th century. In 1812, Mivart's Hotel opened its doors in [[London]], later changing its name to [[Claridge's]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/buildings/inns.shtml|title=Researching the history of pubs, inns and hotels|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nHotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century.

''Examples include: [[Grand Hyatt]], [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad]], [[InterContinental Hotels & Resorts|InterContinental]], [[Sofitel]], [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]], [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]], [[The Peninsula Hotels|The Peninsula]], [[Rosewood Hotels & Resorts|Rosewood]], [[JW Marriott Hotels|JW Marriott]] and [[The Ritz-Carlton]].''\n\n==={{anchor|Lifestyle}}Lifestyle luxury resorts===\n[[File:Main swimming pool, Shangri-La Fijian Resort.jpg|thumb|[[Shangri-La's Fijian Resort]] in [[Yanuca]] Island, Fiji]]\n[[Image:Wild-wadi.jpg|thumb|[[Jumeirah Beach Hotel]] in [[Dubai]], United Arab Emirates]]\nLifestyle luxury [[resorts]] are branded hotels that appeal to a guest with lifestyle or personal image in specific locations. They are typically full-service and classified as luxury. A key characteristic of lifestyle resorts is focus on providing a unique guest experience as opposed to simply providing lodging. Normally, lifestyle resorts are classified with a Five Star hotel rating depending on the country and local classification standards. Examples include: [[Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts|Waldorf Astoria]], [[St. Regis Hotels & Resorts|St. Regis]], [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Shangri-La]], [[The Oberoi Group|Oberoi]], [[Belmond Limited|Belmond]], [[Jumeirah (hotel chain)|Jumeirah]], [[Aman Resorts|Aman]], [[Taj Hotels]], [[Hoshino Resorts|Hoshino]], [[Raffles Hotels & Resorts|Raffles]], [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]], [[Banyan Tree Holdings|Banyan Tree]], [[Regent Hotels & Resorts|Regent]] and [[Park Hyatt]].\n\n==={{anchor|Full}}Upscale full-service===\n[[Conference and resort hotels|Upscale full service hotels]] often provide a wide array of guest services and on-site facilities. Commonly found amenities may include: on-site food and beverage (room service and restaurants), meeting and conference services and facilities, fitness center, and business center. Upscale full-service hotels range in quality from upscale to luxury.  This classification is based upon the quality of facilities and amenities offered by the hotel.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Full-Service Vs.

These hotels are generally 100 rooms or fewer.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hvs.com/Content/3171.pdf|title = Boutique Hotels Segment|last = Balekjian|first = Cristina|date = September 2011|journal = HVS|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Focused}}Focused or select service===\nSmall to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a limited number of on-site amenities that only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the single business traveler. Most focused or select service hotels may still offer full service accommodations but may lack leisure amenities such as an on-site restaurant or a swimming pool. Examples include [[Hyatt Place]], [[Holiday Inn]], [[Courtyard by Marriott]] and [[Hilton Garden Inn]].\n\n==={{anchor|Economy}}Economy and limited service===\nSmall to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a very limited number of on-site amenities and often only offer basic accommodations with little to no services, these facilities normally only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the budget-minded traveler seeking a \"no frills\" accommodation. Limited service hotels often lack an on-site restaurant but in return may offer a limited complimentary food and beverage amenity such as on-site continental breakfast service.  Examples include [[Ibis Budget]], [[Hampton Inn]], [[Aloft Hotels|Aloft]], [[Holiday Inn Express]], [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn]], [[Four Points by Sheraton]].\n\n==={{anchor|Extended}}Extended stay===\n[[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel. Extended stay hotels may offer non-traditional pricing methods such as a weekly rate that caters towards travelers in need of short-term accommodations for an extended period of time. Similar to limited and select service hotels, on-site amenities are normally limited and most extended stay hotels lack an on-site restaurant. Examples include [[Staybridge Suites]], [[Candlewood Suites]], [[Homewood Suites by Hilton]], [[Home2 Suites by Hilton]], [[Residence Inn by Marriott]], [[Element by Westin|Element]], and [[Extended Stay America]].\n\n==={{anchor|Timeshare}}Timeshare and destination clubs===\n[[Timeshare]] and [[Destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership also referred to as a vacation ownership involving the purchase and ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage during a specified period of time. Timeshare resorts often offer amenities similar that of a Full service hotel with on-site restaurant(s), swimming pools, recreation grounds, and other leisure-oriented amenities. Destination clubs on the other hand may offer more exclusive private accommodations such as private houses in a neighborhood-style setting. Examples of timeshare brands include [[Hilton Grand Vacations]], [[Marriott Vacation Club International]], [[Westgate Resorts]], [[Disney Vacation Club]], and [[Holiday Inn|Holiday Inn Club Vacations]].\n\n==={{anchor|Motel}}Motel===\nA [[motel]], an abbreviation for \"motor hotel\", is a small-sized low-rise lodging establishment similar to a limited service, lower-cost hotel, but typically with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. Motels were built to serve road travellers, including travellers on road trip vacations and workers who drive for their job (travelling salespeople, truck drivers, etc.). Common during the 1950s and 1960s, motels were often located adjacent to a major highway, where they were built on inexpensive land at the edge of towns or along stretches of freeway.\n\nNew motel construction is rare in the 2000s as hotel chains have been building economy-priced, limited service franchised properties at freeway exits which compete for largely the same clientele, largely saturating the market by the 1990s. Motels are still useful in less populated areas for driving travelers, but the more populated an area becomes, the more hotels move in to meet the demand for accommodation. While many motels are unbranded and independent, many of the other motels which remain in operation joined national franchise chains, often rebranding themselves as hotels, inns or lodges.  Some examples of chains with motels include [[EconoLodge]], [[Motel 6]], [[Super 8 Motels|Super 8]], and [[Travelodge]].\n\nMotels in some parts of the world are more often regarded as places for romantic assignations where rooms are often rented by the hour. This is fairly common in parts of [[Latin America]].\n\n==={{anchor|Microstay}}Microstay===\nHotels may offer rooms for [[microstay]]s,<ref>{{cite news|title=By-the-Hour Microstays Add to Big Hotels' Bottom Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/business/a-room-by-the-hour-to-refresh.html|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> a type of booking for less than 24 hours where the customer chooses the check in time and the length of the stay.

Degree programs such as [[hospitality management studies]], a [[business degree]], and/or certification programs formally prepare hotel managers for industry practice.\n\nMost hotel establishments consist of a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the \"Hotel Manager\"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel, [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.\n\n=={{anchor|Unique}}Unique and specialty hotels==\n\n=== {{anchor|Historic}} Historic inns and boutique hotels ===\n[[File:Hotel Astoria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]] and statue of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia]]\n[[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.\nSome hotels have gained their renown through tradition, by hosting significant events or persons, such as Schloss [[Cecilienhof]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], which derives its fame from the [[Potsdam Conference]] of the [[World War II]] allies [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Schloss Cecilienhof - Cecilienhof Palace |url=http://www.potsdam.de/node/276259 |work=Landeshauptstadt Potsdam |access-date=23 October 2015}}</ref> The [[Taj Mahal Palace & Tower]] in [[Mumbai]] is one of India's most famous and historic hotels because of its association with the [[Indian independence movement]].

Others have achieved fame by association with dishes or cocktails created on their premises, such as the [[Hotel de Paris]] where the [[cr\u00eape Suzette]] was invented or the [[Raffles Hotel]] in [[Singapore]], where the [[Singapore Sling]] cocktail was devised.<ref>{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Campbell |title=Singapore Journal; Back to Somerset Maugham and Life's Seamy Side |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/travel/singapore-sling-is-spoken-here.html |location=Singapore |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 December 1982 |access-date=11 February 2019 |page=6 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hotel Ritz Paris.jpg|thumb|right|[[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] in [[France]]]]\n\nA number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]], through its association with [[Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin's]] song, '[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]'. The [[Algonquin Hotel]] in New York City is famed as the meeting place of the literary group, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], and [[Hotel Chelsea]], also in New York City, has been the subject of a number of songs and the scene of the stabbing of [[Nancy Spungen]] (allegedly by her boyfriend [[Sid Vicious]]).\n\n==={{anchor|Resort}}Resort hotels===\n[[File:Wynn 2 (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Wynn Las Vegas]], United States]]\nSome hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself to create a captive trade, example at [[casino]]s, [[amusement park]]s and holiday [[resort]]s. Though hotels have always been built in popular destinations, the defining characteristic of a [[resort hotel]] is that it exists purely to serve another attraction, the two having the same owners.\n\nOn the [[Las Vegas Strip]] there is a tradition of [[one-upmanship]] with luxurious and extravagant hotels in a concentrated area. This trend now has extended to other resorts worldwide, but the concentration in Las Vegas is still the world's highest: nineteen of the world's twenty-five largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 67,000 rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/largesthotels.htm |title=The 25 Largest Hotels in the World|accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Other speciality hotels===\n\n[[File:HMSQueenMary photo D Ramey Logan.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[RMS Queen Mary]], Long Beach, California, United States]]\n* The [[Burj al-Arab]] hotel in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], built on an artificial island, is structured in the shape of a boat's sail.\n*The [[Library Hotel]] in New York City, is unique in that each of its ten floors is assigned one category from the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]].\n* The Jailhotel L\u00f6wengraben in [[Lucerne, Switzerland]] is a converted prison now used as a hotel.\n* The [[Luxor (hotel)|Luxor]], a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in [[Paradise, Nevada]], United States is unusual due to its pyramidal structure.\n* The [[Liberty Hotel]] in [[Boston]] used to be the [[Charles Street Jail]].\n* Hotel Kakslauttanen in [[Finland]], a collection of glass igloos in Lapland that allow you to watch the Northern Lights<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://qosy.co/most-luxurious-hotels-retreats/ |title=101 Most Luxurious Hotels and Retreats in the World |access-date=16 April 2014 |work=Qosy}}</ref>\n* Built in [[Scotland]] and completed in 1936, The former [[ocean liner]] {{RMS|Queen Mary}} in [[Long Beach, California]], United States uses its first-class staterooms as a hotel, after retiring in 1967 from Transatlantic service.\n* The [[Wigwam Motel]]s used patented [[novelty architecture]] in which each motel room was a free-standing concrete wigwam or teepee.\n* Various [[caboose|Caboose Motel]] or Red Caboose Inn properties are built from decommissioned rail cars.\n*Throughout the world there are several hotels built from converted airliners.\n\n===Bunker hotels===\nThe [[Null Stern Hotel]] in [[Teufen AR|Teufen]], [[Appenzellerland]], [[Switzerland]] and the Concrete Mushrooms in [[Albania]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Doug |last=McKinlay |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/sep/13/nuclear-bunker-hotel-null-stern-switzerland |title=Switzerland's Null Stern Hotel: the nuclear option |newspaper=[[Guardian (newspaper)|Guardian]] |date=13 September 2009 |access-date=2 January 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225222747/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/sep/13/nuclear-bunker-hotel-null-stern-switzerland |archive-date=22 November 2011 |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}</ref> are former nuclear [[bunker]]s transformed into hotels.\n\n===Cave hotels===\nThe Cuevas Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n (named after the [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n|author]]) in [[Guadix]], Spain, as well as several hotels in [[Cappadocia]], Turkey, are notable for being built into natural cave formations, some with rooms underground.
