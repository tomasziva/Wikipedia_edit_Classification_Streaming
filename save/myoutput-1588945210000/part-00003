{"title_page": "Dutch grammar", "text_new": "{{Dutch grammar}}\nThis article outlines the [[grammar]] of the [[Dutch language]], which shares strong similarities with [[German grammar]] and also, to a lesser degree, with [[English grammar]].\n\n==Preliminary considerations==\n\nVowel length is indicated in Dutch spelling using a combination of double vowels and double consonants. Changes from single to double letters are common when discussing Dutch grammar, but they are entirely predictable once one knows how the spelling rules work.{{cn|date=July 2018}} This means that the spelling alternations do not form part of the grammar, and they are not discussed here. For more information, see [[Dutch orthography]].\n\n==Word order==\n\nDutch word order is underlyingly [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] (subject\u2013object\u2013verb). There is an additional rule called [[V2 word order|V2]] in main clauses, which moves the finite (inflected for subject) verb into the second position in the sentence. Because of this, sentences with only one verb appear with [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] (subject\u2013verb\u2013object) or [[Verb\u2013subject\u2013object|VSO]] (verb\u2013subject\u2013object) order.\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Jan||hielp||zijn moeder\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Jan||helped||his mother\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Jan helped his mother.\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Gisteren||hielp||Jan||zijn moeder\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n| Yesterday||helped||Jan||his mother\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Yesterday, Jan helped his mother.\"\n|}\n\nHowever, any other verbs or verbal particles are placed at the end of the clause in accordance with the underlying SOV order, giving an intermediate order of SVOV(V)(V)...\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Jan||wilde||zijn moeder||gaan helpen\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Jan||wanted||his mother||to go help\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Jan wanted to go help his mother.\"\n|}\n\nIn subordinate clauses, the order is exclusively SOV.<ref>Jan Koster: \"[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/kost006dutc01/kost006dutc01_001.htm Dutch as an SOV Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413224259/http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/kost006dutc01/kost006dutc01_001.htm |date=2005-04-13 }}\", ''Linguistic analysis'' 1 (1975), p. 111-136.</ref><ref>http://www.let.rug.nl/~zwart/college/docs/zinsleer/zinsleer6.pdf</ref> In subordinate clauses two word orders are possible for the verb clusters and are referred to as the \"red\": ''omdat ik heb gewerkt'', \"because I have worked\": like in English, where the auxiliary verb precedes the past particle, and the \"green\": ''omdat ik gewerkt heb'', where the past particle precedes the auxiliary verb, \"because I worked have\": like in German. <ref>http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_han001200701_01/_han001200701_01_0019.php</ref> In Dutch, the green word order is most used in speech, and the red is the most used in writing, particularly in journalistic texts, but the \"green\" is also used in writing.{{cn|date=May 2019}} Unlike in English, however, adjectives and adverbs must precede the verb: ''dat het boek groen is'', \"that the book is green\". For an explanation of verb clusters of three or more see: [[V2 word order#German, Dutch, Afrikaans|V2 word order]]\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Jan||zei||dat||hij||zijn moeder||wilde||gaan helpen\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Jan||said||that||he||his mother||wanted||to go help\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Jan said that he wanted to go help his mother.\"\n|}\n\nIn yes\u2013no questions, the verb of the main clause is usually, but not always, placed first instead of second. If the verb comes second, this often implies disbelief, like in English: \"The prisoner escaped?\" vs. \"Did the prisoner escape?\"\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Hielp||Jan||zijn moeder?\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Helped||Jan||his mother?\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Did Jan help his mother?\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Wilde||Jan||zijn moeder||gaan helpen?\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Wanted||Jan||his mother||to go help?\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Did Jan want to go help his mother?\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Zei||Jan||dat||hij||zijn moeder||wilde||gaan helpen?\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n| Said||Jan||that||he||his mother||wanted||to go help?\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Did Jan say that he wanted to go help his mother?\"\n|}\n\nIn imperative sentences, the verb of the main clause is always placed first, although it may be preceded by a noun phrase indicating who is being addressed.\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|(Jan,)||ga||je moeder||helpen!\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|(Jan,)||go||your mother||help!\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"(Jan,) go help your mother!\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| (Jan,)||zeg||dat||je||je moeder||wilde||gaan helpen!\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n| (Jan,)||say||that||you||your mother||wanted||to go help!\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"(Jan,) say that you wanted to go help your mother!\"\n|}\n\nIn the following example, the SOV order in the subordinate clause causes the various noun phrases to be separated from the verbs that introduce them, creating a relatively deep \"nesting\" structure:\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Ik zie dat || de ouders || de kinderen || Jan || het huis || hebben || laten || helpen || schilderen.\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|I see that || the parents || the children || Jan || the house || have || let || help || paint\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"I see that the parents have let the children help Jan paint the house.\"\n|}\n\n[[Adjective]]s always come before the [[noun]] to which they belong.\n:''rode appels'' \u2013 red apples\n\nIn contrast to English, adpositional phrase come in the order [[time\u2013manner\u2013place]], so that time modifiers usually come before place modifiers:\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Ik|| ben ||dit ||jaar ||naar ||Frankrijk ||geweest\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|I|| am ||this ||year ||to ||France ||been\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"I have been to France this year.\"\n|}\n\n==Nouns==\n{{see also|Gender in Dutch grammar}}\n\nIn Dutch, nouns are marked for [[Grammatical number|number]] in singular and plural. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] have largely fallen out of use, as have the endings that were used for them. Standard Dutch has three [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. However, in large parts of the [[Netherlands]] there is no grammatical distinction between what were originally masculine and feminine genders, and there is only a distinction between common and neuter. Gender is not overtly marked on nouns either, and must be learned for each noun.\n\n===Plural===\n\nThe [[plural]] is formed by addition of ''-en'' (pronounced {{IPA|/\u0259n/}} or {{IPA|/\u0259/}}) or ''-s'', with the usual spelling changes in the case of the former. Which of the two is used is somewhat unpredictable, although some general rules can be given:\n\n* Single-syllable words, which are common in Dutch, normally use ''-en'':\n** ''deur'' \"door\" \u2192 ''deuren''\n** ''boot'' \"boat\" \u2192 ''boten''\n** ''huis'' \"house\" \u2192 ''huizen''\n** ''dief'' \"thief\" \u2192 ''dieven''\n* Words ending in a [[schwa]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} often use ''-s'', but a sizable number uses ''-n'', particularly if they are older. Some nouns may allow either ending. Nouns that are substantivised forms of adjectives always use ''-n''.\n** ''tante'' \"aunt\" \u2192 ''tantes''\n** ''chocolade'' \"chocolate\" \u2192 ''chocolades''\n** ''bode'' \"messenger\" \u2192 ''boden'' or ''bodes''\n** ''oxide'' \"oxide\" \u2192 ''oxiden''\n** ''grote'' \"great one\" \u2192 ''groten''\n* Relatively modern words ending in a long vowel use ''-'s'' (with an apostrophe), but if they end in ''-ee'' or ''-\u00e9'' then no apostrophe is used. Older ones generally use ''-en'' or ''-\u00ebn'' (with diaeresis).\n** ''baby'' \"baby\" \u2192 ''baby's''\n** ''caf\u00e9'' \"caf\u00e9, bar, pub\" \u2192 ''caf\u00e9s''\n** ''pizza'' \"pizza\" \u2192 ''pizza's''\n** ''radio'' \"radio\" \u2192 ''radio's''\n** ''ree'' \"roe\" \u2192 ''ree\u00ebn''\n** ''la'' (also ''lade'') \"drawer\" \u2192 ''laden'' (but in colloquial usage sometimes also ''la's'')\n* Words ending in unstressed ''-el'' or ''-er'' usually use ''-s''. If ''-en'' is allowed it tends to be more archaic or poetic.\n** ''akker'' \"agricultural field\" \u2192 ''akkers''\n** ''appel'' \"apple\" \u2192 ''appels'' or (archaic) ''appelen'' (note: for the derived noun ''aardappel'' \"potato\", the plural ''aardappelen'' is still common, alongside ''aardappels'')\n** ''lepel'' \"spoon\" \u2192 ''lepels''\n** ''sleutel'' \"key\" \u2192 ''sleutels''\n** ''vader'' \"father\" \u2192 ''vaders'' or (archaic) ''vaderen''\n* Initialisms (words pronounced as letters) follow the rules for whatever the final syllable suggests, usually by adding ''-s'' but occasionally ''-en'':\n** ''APK'' \"vehicle inspection\" \u2192 ''APK's''\n** ''cd'' \"CD\" \u2192 ''cd's''\n\n====Plurals with vowel change====\n\nA number of common nouns inherited from [[Old Dutch language|Old Dutch]] have a short vowel in the singular but a long vowel in the plural. When short ''i'' is lengthened in this way, it becomes long ''e''.\n\n* ''dag'' {{IPA|/d\u0251x/}} \u2018day\u2019 \u2192 ''dagen'' {{IPA|/\u02c8da\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)/}} \u2018days\u2019\n* ''gebrek'' {{IPA|/\u0263\u0259\u02c8br\u025bk/}} \u2018lack, deficiency\u2019 \u2192 ''gebreken'' {{IPA|/\u0263\u0259\u02c8bre\u02d0k\u0259(n)/}} \u2018deficiencies\u2019\n* ''schip'' {{IPA|/sx\u026ap/}} \u2018ship\u2019 \u2192 ''schepen'' {{IPA|/\u02c8sxe\u02d0p\u0259(n)/}} \u2018ships\u2019\n* ''slot'' {{IPA|/sl\u0254t/}} \u2018lock\u2019 \u2192 ''sloten'' {{IPA|/\u02c8slo\u02d0t\u0259(n)/}} \u2018locks\u2019 (also the plural of ''sloot'' \u2018ditch\u2019)\n\nOther nouns with this change include: ''(aan)bod'' \u2018offer\u2019, ''bad'' \u2018bath\u2019, ''bedrag'' \u2018(money) contribution\u2019, ''bevel'' \u2018command\u2019, ''blad'' \u2018sheet of paper; magazine\u2019 (not \u2018leaf\u2019), ''dak'' \u2018roof\u2019, ''dal'' \u2018valley\u2019, ''gat'' \u2018hole\u2019, ''gebed'' \u2018prayer\u2019, ''gebod'' \u2018commandment\u2019, ''gen'' \u2018gene\u2019, ''glas'' \u2018glass\u2019, ''god'' \u2018god\u2019, ''hertog'' \u2018duke\u2019, ''hof'' \u2018court\u2019, ''hol'' \u2018cave; burrow\u2019, ''lid'' \u2018member\u2019, ''lot'' \u2018lottery ticket\u2019, ''oorlog'' \u2018war\u2019, ''pad'' \u2018path\u2019, ''schot'' \u2018shot\u2019, ''slag'' \u2018strike, battle\u2019, ''smid'' \u2018smith\u2019, ''spel'' \u2018large game; spectacle\u2019 (not in the sense of a smaller everyday game), ''staf'' \u2018staff\u2019, ''vat'' \u2018vat, barrel\u2019, ''verbod'' \u2018ban, prohibition\u2019, ''verdrag'' \u2018treaty\u2019, ''verlof'' \u2018permission\u2019, ''weg'' \u2018road, way\u2019.\n\nThe noun ''stad'' {{IPA|/st\u0251t/}} \u2018town, city\u2019 has [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] in the plural alongside lengthening: ''steden'' {{IPA|/\u02c8ste\u02d0d\u0259(n)/}} \u2018towns, cities\u2019. The plural of nouns ending in the suffix ''-heid'' {{IPA|/\u0266\u025bit/}} \u2018-ness, -hood\u2019 is irregular ''-heden'' {{IPA|/\u0266e\u02d0d\u0259(n)/}}.\n\n====Plurals in ''-eren''====\n\nA few neuter nouns have a plural in ''-eren''. This ending derives from the old Germanic \"z-stem\" nouns, and is cognate with the English ''-ren'' (''children'', ''brethren'' etc.). The following nouns have this type of plural:\n\n* ''been'' \"bone\" \u2192 ''beenderen'' (when used in the sense \"leg\", the plural is the regular ''benen'')\n* ''blad'' \"leaf\" \u2192 ''bladeren'' (when used in the sense \"sheet, magazine\", the plural is ''bladen'')\n* ''ei'' \"egg\" \u2192 ''eieren''\n* ''gelid'' \"rank, file\" \u2192 ''gelederen''\n* ''gemoed'' \"mood, emotion\" \u2192 ''gemoederen''\n* ''goed'' \"good\" \u2192 ''goederen''\n* ''hoen'' \"fowl\" \u2192 ''hoenderen''\n* ''kalf'' \"calf\" \u2192 ''kalveren''\n* ''kind'' \"child\" \u2192 ''kinderen''\n* ''kleed'' \"cloth\" \u2192 (archaic) ''klederen'' or ''kleren'' \"clothes\" (nowadays a [[plurale tantum]] like in English)\n* ''lam'' \"lamb\" \u2192 ''lammeren''\n* ''lied'' \"song\" \u2192 ''liederen'' (somewhat dated; the plural of the diminutive is often used instead: ''liedjes'')\n* ''rad'' \"wheel\" \u2192 ''raderen''\n* ''rund'' \"cattle\" \u2192 ''runderen''\n* ''volk'' \"people, nation\" \u2192 ''volkeren'' (the regular ''volken'' is also used)\n\nWhen used in compounds, the stem of these nouns usually includes the ''-er''. For example: ''ei'''er'''schaal'' \"eggshell\", ''kind'''er'''arbeid'' \"child labour\", ''kled'''er'''dracht'' \"traditional costume\", ''rund'''er'''tartaar'' \"beef [[tartare]]\", ''volk'''er'''moord'' \"genocide\". This is not a rule, however, and compounds with the singular form also exist: ''eivorm'' \"egg-shape\", ''rundvlees'' \"beef\", ''volk'''s'''lied'' \"national anthem\".\n\n====Foreign plurals====\n\nFor a number of nouns of Latin origin, a Latin-like plural may be used. Depending on the word and the formalness of the setting, a regular plural in ''-en'' or ''-s'' can also be used.\n\n* ''museum'' \"museum\" \u2192 ''musea'' or ''museums''\n* ''politicus'' \"politician\" \u2192 ''politici''\n\nSome modern scientific words borrowed from Latin or Greek form their plurals with vowel lengthening, like the native words listed above. These words are primarily Latin agent nouns ending in ''-or'' and names of particles ending in ''-on''. Alongside the change in vowel length, there is also a stress shift in the plural, patterned on the Latin third declension where this also occurs. In each case, the singular follows a Latin-like stress, while the plural stresses the ''-on-'' or ''-or-''. Some examples:\n\n* ''elektron'' ({{IPA|/e\u02d0\u02c8l\u025bktr\u0254n/}} \"electron\") \u2192 ''elektronen'' ({{IPA|/e\u02d0l\u025bk\u02c8tro\u02d0n\u0259(n)/}} \"electrons\")\n* ''doctor'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0254kt\u0254r/}} \"doctor (holder of a doctorate)\") \u2192 ''doctoren'' ({{IPA|/d\u0254k\u02c8to\u02d0r\u0259(n)/}} \"doctors\")\n* ''graviton'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8\u0263ra\u02d0vit\u0254n/}} \"graviton\") \u2192 ''gravitonen'' ({{IPA|/\u0263ra\u02d0vi\u02c8to\u02d0n\u0259(n)/}} \"gravitons\")\n* ''reactor'' ({{IPA|/re\u02d0\u02c8\u0251kt\u0254r/}} \"reactor\") \u2192 ''reactoren'' ({{IPA|/re\u02d0\u0251k\u02c8to\u02d0r\u0259(n)/}} \"reactors\")\n\nWords borrowed from English or French will generally form their plural in ''-s'', in imitation of the native plural of those languages. This applies especially to recent borrowings.\n\n* ''harddisk'' \u2192 ''harddisks''\n* ''bonbon'' \u2192 ''bonbons''\n\n===Diminutive===\n\nMany nouns have a [[diminutive]] form alongside the normal base form. This form is used to indicate small size, or emphasize a particular endearing quality. Use of diminutives is very common, so much that they could be considered part of the noun's inflectional paradigm.\n\nThere are two basic ways to form the diminutive: with ''-tje'' or with ''-ke(n)''. The former is the standard way, while the latter is found in some dialects, mostly in the south ([[Brabantian]] and [[Limburgish]]). The diminutive on ''-ke(n)'' is common in informal Belgian Dutch (due to final-n deletion in Dutch, the final -n is often not pronounced). All diminutives have neuter gender, no matter what the gender of the original noun was. The plural is always formed with ''-s''.\n\n====Diminutive in ''-tje''====\n\nThe basic suffix ''-tje'' is modified in different ways depending on the final sounds of the noun it is attached to.\n\nThe ''-t-'' is removed from the ending when added to words ending in a [[fricative]] or [[plosive]] (-b, -c, -d, -f, -g, -ch, -k, -p, -q, -s, -sj, -t, -v, -x, -z).\n\n* hond \u2192 hondje\n* brief \u2192 briefje\n* hok \u2192 hokje\n* vis \u2192 visje\n* douche \u2192 doucheje ({{IPA|/du\u0283/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u02c8du\u0283(j)\u0259/}})\n* race \u2192 raceje ({{IPA|/re\u02d0s/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u02c8re\u02d0sj\u0259/}} ~ {{IPA|/\u02c8re\u02d0\u0283\u0259/}})\n\nNote that the last two words really end in a consonant, despite not being spelled that way.\n\nWhen the vowel of the last syllable is both short and stressed, and it is followed by a [[sonorant]], an extra schwa ''-e-'' is inserted, giving '''-etje'''.\n* kom \u2192 kommetje\n* pil \u2192 pilletje\n* lam \u2192 lammetje\n* ding \u2192 dingetje\n* vriendin \u2192 vriendinnetje\n* baron \u2192 baronnetje\n\nIn all other cases, the basic form '''-tje''' is used. This includes:\n* Words ending in a stressed tense/long vowel or [[diphthong]].\n* Words ending in any unstressed vowel. \n* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by ''-l'', ''-n'', ''-r''.\n* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by ''-m''. The resulting combination ''-mtje'' is assimilated to '''-mpje'''.\n* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by ''-ng''. The resulting combination ''-ngtje'' is assimilated to '''-nkje'''.\n\nWhen the final vowel is long, it is doubled accordingly. Final ''-i'', which does not really occur in native Dutch words, is converted into ''-ie''. Final ''-y'' gets an apostrophe.\n\n* koe \u2192 koetje\n* auto \u2192 autootje\n* mama \u2192 mamaatje\n* vrouw \u2192 vrouwtje\n* taxi \u2192 taxietje\n* baby \u2192 baby'tje\n* school \u2192 schooltje\n* kuil \u2192 kuiltje\n* maan \u2192 maantje\n* muur \u2192 muurtje\n* appel \u2192 appeltje\n* boom \u2192 boompje\n* duim \u2192 duimpje\n* bodem \u2192 bodempje\n* koning \u2192 koninkje\n* houding \u2192 houdinkje\n\nIn the case of the vowels ''oe'' and ''ie'', there is some ambiguity. While pronounced short in many dialects, they can also be long for some speakers, so forms both with and without the extra ''-e-'' can be found.\n* bloem \u2192 bloemetje ''or'' bloempje (however ''bloemetje'' has an additional meaning: ''bouquet'')<ref>http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1195/bloem_bloempje_bloemetje/</ref>\n* wiel \u2192 wieltje ''or'' wieletje\n\n====Diminutive in ''-ke(n)''====\n\nIn the south, the ending ''-ke(n)'' is often used instead. It also has different forms depending on the preceding sounds, with rules very similar to those for the ''-tje'' ending.\n\nAn older form of this ending was ''-ken'', which is more like its German cognate ''-chen''. This form is not used much today, due to final n-deletion which is common in Dutch, but it is still found in older texts and names. A famous example is ''[[Manneken Pis]]''.\n\nWhen the word ends in a [[velar]] consonant (-g, -ch, -k, -ng), an extra [[Dissimilation|dissimilative]] ''-s-'' is inserted, giving '''-ske(n)'''.\n* dag \u2192 dagske\n* lach \u2192 lachske\n* stok \u2192 stokske\n* ding \u2192 dingske\n* koning \u2192 koningske\n\nAn extra ''-e-'' is inserted in three cases, giving '''-eke(n)''':\n* Words ending in a non-velar plosive (-p, -b, -t, -d).\n* Words ending in ''-n'', which is not a velar itself but would assimilate to one before the following ''-k-''.\n* Words ending in ''-m'', ''-l'' or ''-r'' preceded by a stressed short vowel.\n\nExamples:\n\n* hond \u2192 hondeke\n* voet \u2192 voeteke\n* map \u2192 mappeke\n* boon \u2192 boneke\n* bon \u2192 bonneke\n* kom \u2192 kommeke\n* hol \u2192 holleke\n* bar \u2192 barreke\n\nIn all other cases, the ending is the basic '''-ke(n)'''. This includes:\n* Words ending in a vowel.\n* Words ending in a non-velar [[fricative]] (-f, -v, -s, -z).\n* Words ending in ''-m'', ''-l'', ''-r'' preceded by a long vowel, [[diphthong]], or unstressed vowel.\n\nExamples:\n\n* mama \u2192 mamake\n* koe \u2192 koeke\n* slof \u2192 slofke\n* doos \u2192 dooske\n* school \u2192 schoolke\n* muur \u2192 muurke\n* boom \u2192 boomke\n* bodem \u2192 bodemke\n\n====Umlaut in diminutives====\n\nStandard Dutch, as well as most dialects, do not use [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] as a grammatical marker. However, some eastern dialects (East [[Brabantian]], [[Limburgish]] and many [[Low Saxon dialects in the Netherlands|Low Saxon]] areas) have regular umlaut of the preceding vowel in diminutives. As this is not a standard feature, it is rare in the written language except when used to evoke a local feeling. It can be more common in the spoken language. Some examples:\n\n* ''man'' \u2192 ''menneke''\n* ''boom'' \u2192 ''beumke''\n* ''pop'' \u2192 ''pupke''\n\n====Diminutives of nouns with irregular plurals====\n\nNouns with irregular plurals tend to have the same irregularity in the diminutive as well. This is not a rule, however, and both forms can often be found. For some nouns, the irregularity is more common in the plural of the diminutive, and only rarely appears in the singular. Some examples:\n\n* ''blad'' \u2018leaf; sheet of paper\u2019 \u2192 ''blaadje'' \u2018small leaf; folio\u2019, in plural also ''bladertjes''\n* ''dag'' \u2018day\u2019 \u2192 ''dagje'' \u2018short day\u2019, in plural also ''daagjes''\n* ''glas'' \u2018drinking glass\u2019 \u2192 ''glaasje'' \u2018small glass\u2019\n* ''kind'' \u2018child\u2019 \u2192 ''kindje'' \u2018toddler\u2019, in plural also ''kindertjes''\n* ''pad'' \u2018path\u2019 \u2192 ''paadje'' \u2018narrow or short path\u2019 (vs. ''pad'' \u2018toad\u2019 \u2192 ''padje'' \u2018toadlet\u2019)\n* ''rad'' \u2018wheel\u2019 \u2192 ''radje'' or ''radertje'' \u2018little wheel\u2019\n* ''schip'' \u2018ship\u2019 \u2192 ''scheepje'' \u2018little ship\u2019\n* ''spel'' \u2018game\u2019 \u2192 ''speeltje'' \u2018toy\u2019\n* ''vat'' \u2018barrel\u2019 \u2192 ''vaatje'' \u2018small barrel\u2019\n\n===Cases===\n{{main|Archaic Dutch declension}}\n\n[[Noun cases]] were still prescribed in the formal written standard up until the 1940s, but were abolished then because they had long disappeared from the spoken language. Because of this, they are nowadays restricted mostly to set phrases and are [[Archaism|archaic]]. The former Dutch case system resembled that of modern [[German language|German]], and distinguished four cases: [[Nominative case|nominative]] (subject), [[Genitive case|genitive]] (possession or relation), [[Dative case|dative]] (indirect object, object of preposition) and [[Accusative case|accusative]] (direct object, object of preposition). Only the nominative and genitive are productive, with the genitive seldom used and only surviving in the margins of the language. Some examples of the three non-nominative cases in fixed expressions:\n\n* Genitive: ''de dag '''des''' oordeel'''s''''' \"judgement day\", ''Koninkrijk '''der''' Nederlanden'' \"Kingdom of the Nederlands\"\n* Dative: ''in feit'''e''''' \"in fact\", ''heden '''ten''' dag'''e''''' \"nowadays\", ''bij deze'''n''''' \"hereby\"\n* Accusative: ''op '''den''' duur'' \"eventually\", ''goede'''n'''avond'' \"good evening\"\n\nThe role of cases has been taken over by prepositions and word order in modern Dutch. For example, the distinction between direct and indirect object is now made by placing the indirect object before the direct object, or by using the preposition ''aan'' \"to\" with the indirect object. The genitive is replaced with the preposition ''van'' \"of\". Usage of cases with prepositions has disappeared as well.\n\nCases are still occasionally used productively, which are often [[calque]]s of existing phrases. This is particularly true of the genitive case,<ref>http://www.nytud.hu/imm14/abs/scott.pdf</ref> which is still used occasionally to evoke a formal style. Speakers' awareness of how the cases were originally used is generally low. People may confuse the old masculine/neuter genitive article ''des'' and the corresponding noun ending ''-s'' with the article ''der'' (with no ending) used for feminine or plural nouns.\n\n==Articles==\n\nDutch has both a [[definite article]] (\"the\") and an [[indefinite article]] (\"a\" or \"an\").<ref>{{cite web | title=de / het: algemene regels | website=Onze Taal | date=2011-04-08 | url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/de-het-algemene-regels/ | language=nl | access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://understandingdutch.com/difference-between-de-and-het-dutch |title=Difference between de and het |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2018-05-05 |website=UnderstandingDutch.com |publisher= |access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n|-\n! Definite singular\n| '''de''' man\n| '''de''' vrouw\n| '''het''' huis\n|-\n! Definite plural\n| '''de''' mannen\n| '''de''' vrouwen\n| '''de''' huizen\n|-\n! Indefinite singular\n| '''een''' man\n| '''een''' vrouw\n| '''een''' huis\n|}\n\n''Het'' and ''een'' are normally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0259t/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259n/}}, respectively. They may sometimes also be contracted in spelling to reflect this: ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>t'', ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>n''.\n\nThere is no indefinite article in the plural, the noun is just used on its own. However, there is a negative indefinite article '''''geen''''' (\"no, not a, not any\"). Similarly to ''een'' it is invariable, showing no inflection for gender or number.\n\n* ''Dat is geen man'' (\"That is not a man\")\n* ''Dat is geen vrouw'' (\"That is not a woman\")\n* ''Dat is geen huis'' (\"That is not a house\")\n* ''Dat zijn geen mannen'' (\"Those aren't men\")\n* ''Ik heb geen water'' (\"I have no water\", \"I don't have any water\")\n\nThe articles formerly had forms for the different cases as well. See [[Archaic Dutch declension]] for more information.\n\n==Adjectives and adverbs==\n\nWithin the Dutch [[noun phrase]], adjectives are placed in front of the noun and after the article (if present).\n\n===Inflection===\n\nThe inflection of adjectives follows the gender and number of the following noun. They also inflect for [[definiteness]], like in many other [[Germanic languages]]. When preceded by a definite article, demonstrative determiner, possessive determiner or any other kind of word that acts to distinguish one particular thing from another, the definite form of the adjective is used. In other cases, such as with an indefinite article, indefinite determiner (like ''veel'' \"many\" or ''alle'' \"all\"), the indefinite form is used.\n\nDespite the many different aspects that determine the inflection of an adjective, the adjective only occurs in two main forms. The '''uninflected form''' or '''base form''' is the adjective without any endings. The '''inflected form''' has the ending ''-e''. The inflection of adjectives is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n! Plural\n|-\n! Indefinite\n| een klein'''e''' man\n| een klein'''e''' vrouw\n| een klein huis\n| klein'''e''' mannen, vrouwen, huizen\n|-\n! Definite\n| de klein'''e''' man\n| de klein'''e''' vrouw\n| het klein'''e''' huis\n| de klein'''e''' mannen, vrouwen, huizen\n|}\n\nAdjectives are only inflected in this way when they are in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] role, where they precede a noun and modify it. Adjectives in a predicative role, which are used in predicative sentences with a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, are not inflected and always use the uninflected form. Compare:\n\n* ''de klein'''e''' man'' (\"the small man\") &mdash; ''de man is klein'' (\"the man is small\")\n* ''klein'''e''' huizen'' (\"small houses\") &mdash; ''huizen zijn klein'' (\"houses are small\")\n\nMost adjectives ending in ''-en'' have no inflected form. This includes adjectives for materials, as well as the past participles of strong verbs.\n\n* ''de houten stoel'' (\"the wooden chair\")\n* ''het stenen huis'' (\"the brick house\")\n* ''de gebroken lampen'' (\"the broken lamps\")\n\nAdjectives that end in a vowel in their uninflected form are rare, and there are no fixed rules for them. Often, the uninflected and inflected forms are the same, but sometimes an extra ''-\u00eb'' is added on anyway.\n\n====Additional uses of the uninflected form====\n\nUninflected adjectives are occasionally found in other contexts. With neuter nouns, if the adjective is inherently part of the noun as part of a set phrase, then the uninflected form is often used in the definite singular as well:\n\n* ''het openbaar vervoer'' (\"the public transport\", as a specific entity)\n* ''het openbar'''e''' vervoer'' (\"the public transport\", meaning the transport that is public, it could be any transport)\n* ''het groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal'' (\"the big dictionary of the Dutch language\", as a proper title)\n* ''het grot'''e''' woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal'' (\"the big dictionary of the Dutch language\", a dictionary that happens to be big)\n* ''het Burgerlijk Wetboek'' (\"the civil code\", as a proper name)\n\nIndefinite adjectives describing people often remain uninflected, if they express a personal quality. This is not stylistically neutral, but has a formal, rhetorical or poetic ring to it, and can occasionally distinguish literal meanings of an adjective from a more figurative one. Furthermore, this is only done with some nouns, not all.\n\n* ''een talentvol schrijver'' (\"a talented writer\") &mdash; ''een talentvolle schrijver'' (the same)\n* ''een groot man'' (\"a great man\"; figurative meaning) &mdash; ''een grote man'' (\"a big/tall man\"; literal meaning) &mdash; ''een grote vrouw'' (\"a great/big/tall woman\"; ''-e'' is always used with ''vrouw'')\n\n===Partitive===\n\nAdjectives have a special form called the '''partitive''' that is used after an [[indefinite pronoun]] such as ''iets'' \u2018something\u2019, ''niets'' \u2018nothing\u2019, ''veel'' \u2018much, a lot\u2019, ''weinig'' \u2018little, a few\u2019. The partitive form takes the ending ''-s''.\n\n* ''Vertel me iets interessant'''s'''.'' (\"Tell me something interesting.\")\n* ''Ik heb iemand nieuw'''s''' leren kennen.'' (\"I've got to meet somebody new.\")\n\nAdjectives already ending in ''-s'' or ''-sch'' don't take this ending:\n\n* ''Ik heb iets paars aangetrokken.'' (\"I've put on something purple.\") (the base form is already ''paars'')\n* ''Er is niet veel fantastisch aan.'' (\"There isn't much fantastic about it.\")\n\nThe few adjectives that end in a long vowel take instead ''-\u2019s'' with an apostrophe like certain noun plurals.\n\n* ''Ik vond paars niet zo mooi, dus heb ik nu iets lila'''\u2019s'''.'' (\"I didn't like purple so much, so now I have something lilac.\")\n\n===Adjectives used as adverbs===\n\nThe uninflected form of an adjective is implicitly also an adverb. This makes it hard at times to distinguish adjectives and adverbs in Dutch.\n\n* ''Dat is een snell'''e''' auto. De auto rijdt snel.'' (\"That is a fast car. The car drives fast.\")\n* ''Wij werden vriendelijk begroet door die vriendelijk'''e''' mensen.'' (\"We were kindly welcomed by those kind people.\")\n\n===Adjectives used as nouns===\n\nThe inflected form of an adjective can also be used as a noun. Three types can be distinguished:\n\n* The noun that the adjective refers to is omitted but implied. The adjective will then be inflected as if the noun had been present, although the inflected form is normally used even in the indefinite neuter singular.\n** ''Je kunt deze auto kopen in verschillende kleuren. Wil je de '''groene''', de '''blauwe''' of de '''gele'''?'' (\"You can buy this car in various colours. Do you want the green, the blue or the yellow one?\")\n** ''Wij hebben drie kinderen, twee '''grote''' en een '''kleine'''.'' (\"We have three children, two big ones and a small one.\", alternatively ''Wij hebben drie kinderen, twee grote en een klein.'')\n* The adjective is used as a masculine/feminine noun in its own right, usually referring to a person. The ''-e'' will always be added, even to adjectives that already end in ''-en''. The plural is formed with ''-n''.\n** ''Je rijdt als een '''blinde'''!'' (\"You drive like a blind person!\")\n** ''Waar ben je, mijn '''geliefde'''?'' (\"Where are you, my loved one?\")\n** ''Laat de '''gevangene''' vrij!'' (\"Release the prisoner!\", from the past participle ''gevangen'' \"captured, imprisoned\")\n** ''De '''rijken''' moeten de '''armen''' helpen.'' (\"The rich should help the poor.\")\n* The adjective is used as a neuter [[mass noun]] describing a concept.\n** ''Ik kan geen antwoord geven, omdat ik het '''gevraagde''' niet begrijp.'' (\"I can't answer, because I don't understand what was asked.\")\n** ''Angst voor het '''onbekende''' is heel gewoon.'' (\"Fear of the unknown is very normal.\")\n\n===Comparative and superlative===\n\nAdjectives have three degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative. The comparative and superlative are formed synthetically, by adding endings to the adjective. The comparative and superlative can also be formed analytically by using ''meer'' \"more\" and ''meest'' \"most\", but this is much rarer than in English. The analytic forms are used only when the word would become particularly long, or when it would become hard to pronounce (particularly in the superlative).\n\nThe comparative is formed by adding ''-er'' to the base form. For adjectives that end in ''-r'', the comparative is formed by adding ''-der'' to the base form instead. The comparative inflects as an adjective in its own right, having inflected and partitive forms. The uninflected comparative can be used as an adverb as well.\n\n* ''Ik ben groot, maar jij bent grot'''er'''.'' (\"I'm big, but you're bigger.\")\n* ''Dit speelgoed kan gevaarlijk zijn voor klein'''ere''' kinderen. (\"This toy can be dangerous for smaller children.\")\n* ''Deze jas is duur'''der'''.'' (\"This coat is more expensive.\")\n* ''Heb je niets goedkop'''ers'''?'' (\"Do you have nothing cheaper?\")\n* ''Dat heb je nog fantastisch'''er''' gedaan dan de vorige keer!'' (\"You did it even more fantastically than last time!\")\n\nThe superlative is formed by adding ''-st''. This is equivalent to adding ''-t'' to the partitive, and the same rules apply. When an adjective ends in ''-s'' or ''-sch'', this becomes ''-st'' and ''-scht'', but these forms are more rarely used, and the analytic form with ''meest'' is preferred.\n\n* ''De Mont Blanc is de hoog'''ste''' berg van de Alpen.'' (\"Mont Blanc is the highest mountain of the Alps.\")\n* ''Dit is het vies'''te''' toilet dat ik ooit heb gezien.'' (\"This is the dirtiest toilet I've ever seen.\", alternatively ''Dit is het '''meest vieze''' toilet...'')\n\nBecause it is most often used to distinguish one particular thing from all others, the superlative is generally accompanied by a definite article. This means it is rarely found in the uninflected form. Even in predicative sentences, a definite article precedes, so it becomes more like a noun phrase with an implied noun.\n\n* ''Deze jas is de duur'''ste'''.'' (\"This coat is the most expensive.\")\n* ''Dit huis is het groot'''ste'''.'' (\"This house is the biggest.\")\n\nWhen used as an adverb, the superlative is always preceded by the neuter article ''het'', unlike in English where this is optional. Either the uninflected or the inflected form can be used, without any difference in meaning. This form can also be used as part of predicative sentences, which can lead to a mismatch of genders which may seem odd at first glance, but is correct nonetheless:\n\n* ''Deze jas is '''het''' duur'''st'''('''e''').'' (\"This coat is (the) most expensive\")\n* ''Dit huis is '''het''' groot'''st'''('''e''').'' (\"This house is (the) biggest.\")\n* ''Onze auto rijdt '''het''' hard'''st'''('''e''') van allemaal.'' (\"Our car drives (the) fastest of all.\")\n\nNote that the first sentence meaning \"This coat is the most expensive\" has the same meaning as the first sentence further above. They are interchangeable, but they would be parsed differently. With the article ''de'', there is an implied noun, and it might better be translated as \"the most expensive ''one''\". The superlative must also be in the inflected form in this case, ''de duurst'' would be incorrect. With the article ''het'', there is no implied noun, and both the inflected (''het duurste'') and uninflected form (''het duurst'') can be used.\n\nSome comparatives and superlatives are [[Suppletion|suppletive]], and use a different root than the base form. These are irregular.\n\n* ''goed, beter, best'' \u2018good/well, better, best\u2019\n* ''veel, meer, meest'' \u2018much/many, more, most\u2019\n* ''weinig, minder, minst'' \u2018little/few, less/fewer, least/fewest\u2019\n* ''graag, liever, liefst'' \u2018willingly/gladly, rather/more preferably, most preferably\u2019\n* ''dikwijls, vaker, vaakst'' \u2018often, more often, most often\u2019\n\nWhen an adjective is a compound of an adverb and a verb participle, the adverb sometimes changes rather than the whole word. A space may be added as well.\n\n* ''dichtbij, dichterbij, dichtstbij'' \u2018close/nearby, closer, closest\u2019\n* ''dichtbevolkt, dichter bevolkt, dichtstbevolkt'' \u2018densely populated, more densely populated, most densely populated\u2019\n\n==Pronouns and determiners==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pronoun]] -->\n\n===Personal pronouns===\nAs in English, Dutch personal pronouns still retain a distinction in case. Two case forms survive: the subjective on the one hand, and the objective on the other.\n\nLike many other European languages, Dutch has a [[T-V distinction]] in its personal pronouns. The second-person pronouns, which are used to refer to the listener, exist in informal and formal varieties. However, because of the relatively complex and dialect-specific way in which the pronouns developed, this is less straightforward than it is in for example French or German. The [[old Germanic]]/[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] second-person singular pronoun ''du'' / ''doe'' (English ''thou'') fell out of use in Dutch during the [[Middle Ages]], while it remained in use in the closely related [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and in neighboring [[Low German]], [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] and [[German language|German]] languages. The role of the old singular pronoun was taken over by the old plural form, which differed slightly depending on dialect: ''gij'' in the South, ''jij'' in the North. This development also happened in English, which once had a T-V distinction but then lost it when the old informal pronoun ''thou'' was lost. In Dutch, however, further changes occurred, and the North and South developed differently:\n\n* In the North and in the standard language, a new formal pronoun ''u'' was introduced, which made ''jij'' distinctly informal. A new second-person plural pronoun was created by adding ''lie(den)'' \"people\" to the old singular (compare English ''[[y'all]]''). This created ''jullie'', an informal pronoun when speaking to many people. The formal pronoun ''u'' is used for both singular and plural.\n* In many Southern dialects, the older situation remained, and ''gij'' is still a neutral way to speak to a person in those dialects. However, informal ''jij'' and formal ''u'' are commonly used in the standard language of the South, like in the North.\n* Many dialects created their own plural forms of pronouns, such as ''gijlie'' or similar in the South for the second person plural, and also ''hullie'' for the third person plural (\"they\"). These forms are not part of standard Dutch.\n\nMany pronouns can occur in a stressed form and an unstressed (clitic) form. The stressed form retains the original full vowel, and is used when particular emphasis or contrast is needed. The unstressed form normally replaces the vowel with a schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}} and is used in other cases. The unstressed forms are shown in brackets; those spelled with an apostrophe or hyphen are not used often in formal written text.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! [[Grammatical person|person]] !! [[subject (grammar)|subject]] !! [[object (grammar)|object]]\n|-\n| 1st person singular || ik ('k) || mij (me)\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, informal || jij (je) || jou (je)\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, formal || u || u\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, Southern || gij (ge) || u\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, masculine || hij ({{not a typo|-ie}}) || hem ('m)\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, feminine || zij (ze) || haar ('r, d'r)\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, neuter || het ('t) || het ('t)\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| 1st person plural || wij (we) || ons\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, informal || jullie (je) || jullie (je)\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, formal || u || u\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, Southern || gij (ge) || u\n|-\n| 3rd person plural, for a person || zij (ze) || hun, hen (ze)\n|-\n| 3rd person plural, for an object || zij (ze) || die (ze)\n|}\n\nThe pronouns are the only place in the standard language where the difference between masculine and feminine gender is significant. Consequently, the usage of the pronouns differs depending on how many genders are distinguished by a speaker. Speakers in the North will use feminine pronouns for female people, and the masculine pronouns for male people and for common-gender (masculine or feminine) nouns. In the South, the feminine pronouns are used for feminine nouns and the masculine pronouns are used for masculine nouns. See [[Gender in Dutch grammar]] for more details.\n\nThe standard language prescribes that in the third person plural, ''hen'' is to be used for the direct object, and ''hun'' for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms ''hun'' and ''hen'' are interchangeable in normal usage, with ''hun'' being more common. The shared unstressed form ''ze'' is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/hunhen.php |title=''Hun'' of ''hen''? |accessdate=2007-05-23 |work=Onze Taal Taaladviesdienst}}</ref>\n\nIn the North, in informal spoken language, ''hun'' is also used as a subject pronoun by some speakers. This is considered heavily stigmatised and substandard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/hunhebben.php |title=Hun hebben? |accessdate=2007-05-23 |work=Onze Taal Taaladviesdienst}}</ref>\n\n===Possessive determiners===\n\nPossessive determiners also have stressed and unstressed forms, like the pronouns.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! [[Grammatical person|person]] !! uninflected !! inflected\n|-\n| 1st person singular || mijn (m'n) || mijne\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, informal || jouw (je) || jouwe\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, formal || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, southern || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, masculine || zijn (z'n) || zijne\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, feminine || haar ('r, d'r) || hare\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, neuter || zijn (z'n) || zijne\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| 1st person plural || ons || onze\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, informal || jullie (je) || &mdash;\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, formal || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, southern || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 3rd person plural || hun || hunne\n|}\n\nPossessive determiners are not inflected when used attributively, unlike adjectives. Thus:\n\n* ''Hij is mijn man.'' (\"He is my husband.\")\n* ''Dat is mijn huis.'' (\"That is my house.\")\n\nAn exception is ''ons'', which inflects like an indefinite adjective, receiving ''-e'' when used with a masculine, feminine or plural noun. Possessive determiners are themselves definite in meaning, so any following adjectives will occur in the definite form even when the possessive itself does not:\n\n* ''ons grot'''e''' huis'' (\"our big house\")\n* ''onz'''e''' grot'''e''' huizen'' (\"our big houses\").\n\nThe inflected form is also used when the determiner is used predicatively. It is always preceded by a definite article in this case, giving the appearance of an implied noun. For example: ''Dit is mijn auto. De auto is de mijn'''e'''.'' (\"This is my car. The car is mine.\", more literally \"The car is the my one\"). ''Jullie'' has no inflected form, the sentence is usually rephrased with ''van'' instead: ''De auto is van jullie.'' (\"The car is of you.\")\n\nBefore the case system was abolished from written Dutch, all possessive determiners inflected as indefinite adjectives, not only ''ons''. They also inflected for case. While this is no longer done in modern Dutch, some relics still remain in fixed expressions. See [[Archaic Dutch declension]] for more details.\n\n===Demonstrative determiners===\nLike English, Dutch has two sets of demonstrative for different degrees of distance. A third, unspecific degree also exists, which is fulfilled by the personal pronouns, but see further below on pronominal adverbs.\n\nThe demonstratives inflect like indefinite adjectives, but irregularly. They are themselves definite in meaning, so any following adjectives will occur in the definite form.\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Proximal demonstrative\n|\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n|-\n! Singular\n| deze\n| deze\n| dit\n|-\n! Plural\n| deze\n| deze\n| deze\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Distal demonstrative\n|\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n|-\n! Singular\n| die\n| die\n| dat\n|-\n! Plural\n| die\n| die\n| die\n|}\n|}\n\nWhen the demonstrative pronoun is used [[exophora|exophorically]] (referring to something that has not yet been mentioned in the text), the \"uninflected\" forms ''dit'' and ''dat'' are always used:\n* '''''Dit''' is mijn nieuwe auto. Ik heb '''deze''' gisteren gekocht.'' (\"This is my new car. I bought this one yesterday.\")\nEven though ''auto'' is of common gender and otherwise requires the form ''deze''. In this sentence, the first pronoun (''dit'') is exophoric, while the second one (''deze'') refers back to ''auto''.\n\nThe exophoric pronoun, when used in a predicative sentence, is always the complement and never the subject. The inflection of the verb follows the other argument instead, and will be plural even when the pronoun is not:\n* ''Dat is een nieuw huis.'' (\"That is a new house\")\n* ''Dit is mijn boek.'' (\"This is my book\")\n* ''Dat zijn nieuwe huizen.'' (\"Those are new houses\", notice singular ''dat'', with plural verb ''zijn'' agreeing with plural noun ''huizen'')\n* ''Dit zijn mijn boeken.'' (\"These are my books\", same with ''dit'')\n\n===Pronominal adverbs===\n{{see also|Pronominal adverb}}\n\nA pronominal adverb is a location adverb that corresponds in meaning to a pronoun, and takes its place. These exist in English as well, but are rare; examples are ''thereby'' (\"by that\"), ''herewith'' (\"with this\") and ''whereupon'' (\"upon what\" or \"upon which\").\n\nPronominal adverbs are used to replace the combination of prepositions with pronouns. They are very common in Dutch, and in some cases mandatory. The following table shows the pronouns that have adverbial forms:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Type\n! Pronoun\n! Adverb\n! Meaning\n|-\n|''personal''\n| hem, haar, het, hun/hen/ze\n| er\n| him, her, it, them, there (unspecific)\n|-\n|''proximal<br>demonstrative''\n| dit\n| hier\n| this, here\n|-\n|''distal<br>demonstrative''\n| dat\n| daar\n| that, there\n|-\n|''interrogative or''<br>''relative''\n| wat, welk, welke\n| waar\n| what, which, where\n|-\n| ''universal''\n| alles\n| overal\n| everything, everywhere\n|-\n|''indefinite''\n| iets\n| ergens\n| something, somewhere\n|-\n|''negative''\n| niets\n| nergens\n| nothing, nowhere\n|}\n\nBoth the combination of preposition+pronoun and the  pronominal adverb can often be used, although the adverbial form is more common. The pronoun is used mainly when one needs to be specific about it. The neuter pronoun ''het'' can never appear as the object of a preposition; the adverbial form is mandatory. Combinations of a preposition and a relative pronoun are also usually replaced by a pronominal adverb. E.g. de combination ''met dewelke'' (with which) is distinctly dated and usually replaced by ''waarmee''.\nThe masculine and feminine pronouns are used more often in the pronoun form, particularly when referring to persons, but the adverbial form may be used occasionally as well. \n\nPronominal adverbs are formed by replacing the pronoun by its corresponding locative adverb and the preposition by its adverbial form and putting them ''in reverse order''. The locative adverbs ''overal'', ''ergens'' and ''nergens'' are separated from the prepositional part by a space, while the other four are joined to it. For example:\n\n* ''Ik reken op je steun.'' (\"I'm counting on your support.\")\n* ''Ik reken '''er'''op.'' (\"I'm counting on it.\")\n* ''Ik reken '''nergens''' op.'' (\"I'm counting on nothing.\", more freely \"I'm not counting on anything.\")\n\nFor most prepositions the adverbial form is ''identical'' with the preposition itself, but there are two exceptions:\n* ''met'' \"with\" \u2192 ''mee''\n** ''Hij stemt '''met''' alle voorstellen in.'' (\"He agrees with all proposals.\")\n** ''Hij stemt er'''mee''' in.'' (\"He agrees with it.\")\n** ''Hij stemt overal '''mee''' in.'' (\"He agrees with everything.\")\n* ''tot'' \"(up) to\" \u2192 ''toe''\n** ''Ik kan me niet brengen '''tot''' deze wandaden.'' (\"I can't bring myself to (commit) these atrocities.\")\n** ''Ik kan me hier'''toe''' niet brengen.'' (\"I can't bring myself to this.\")\n\nThere are prepositions like ''sinds'', ''via'', ''vanwege'' that do not possess an adverbial form, which makes it difficult to use them in a relative construction, because the relative pronouns like ''dewelke'', ''hetwelk'' are becoming obsolete.\n\nConversely, there are a number of prepositional adverbs like ''heen'' or ''af'' that cannot be used as prepositions, but they occur regularly as part of a pronominal adverb or of a separable verb.\n\nThe adverbial pronoun and the prepositional adverb can be separated from each other, with the prepositional part placed at the end of the clause. This is not always required, however, and some situations allow them to remain together.\n\n* '''''Daar''' reken ik '''op'''.'' (\"That, I am counting on.\"), they can be combined too: '''''Daarop''' reken ik.'' or ''Ik reken '''daarop'''.''\n* ''Ik reken '''er''' niet '''op'''.'' (\"I am not counting on it.\"), here they must be separated.\n\nNotice that in Dutch the last word ''op'' is generally analyzed as an ''adverb'', not a preposition. Thus, the often quoted 'rule' that a sentence should not end in a preposition is strictly adhered to.\n\n==Verbs==\n\nDutch verbs inflect for person and number, and for two [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and three [[Grammatical mood|moods]]. However, there is considerable [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] among the forms. In modern usage only the present singular indicative has different forms for different persons, all other number, tense and mood combinations have just one form for all persons.\n\nDutch verbs inflect in these two main tenses:\n* The '''[[present tense]]''' is used to indicate present or future time, and may therefore be considered a \"non-past\" tense. It can express actions that are punctual, progressive or habitual.\n* The '''[[past tense]]''' is used to indicate past time. The actions can be progressive or habitual at the time being discussed, as well as punctual in a sequence of retold events. It is not used to indicate completed punctual events that have relevance for the present; instead the (periphrastic) present perfect is used in this role. Contrast Dutch ''ik heb gisteren mijn vriend ontmoet'' with English ''I met my friend yesterday'' &mdash; the time being discussed is past, but it is considered relevant in the present moment.\n\nVerbs also inflect for the following moods:\n* The '''[[indicative mood]]''' is the default mood of Dutch and is used for general statements.\n* The '''[[subjunctive mood]]''' is used for statements that are perceived as hypothetical or desired. Due to syncretism it is only clearly distinguished from the indicative in the present singular. It is only slightly productive in modern Dutch, and is mainly restricted to formulaic phrases otherwise, such as ''leve de koning'' \"long live the king\" or ''mogen zij in vrede rusten'' \"may they rest in peace\". Usually, it is replaced by the indicative or by a periphrastic conditional phrase.\n* The '''[[imperative mood]]''' is used for commands. It exists only for the second person; imperatives for other persons are expressed periphrastically (''laten we...'' \"let's...\"). Only one form is used for both the singular and plural imperative in modern Dutch. The older separate plural imperative form has fallen out of use and is now archaic or overly formal in tone.\n\nOther grammatical categories such as [[future tense]], [[passive voice]], [[progressive aspect|progressive]] or [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect aspect]] may be expressed periphrastically. Verbs additionally have an infinitive and two participles (present and past).\n\n===Conjugation===\n{{main|Dutch conjugation}}\n\nDutch conjugation resembles that of other continental West Germanic languages such as (Standard) German and Low German, and also the other Germanic languages to a lesser degree. Dutch retains the two main types of verb inherited from [[Proto-Germanic]]: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]]. [[Preterite-present verb]]s are also present, but can be considered irregular. All regular verbs conjugate the same in the present tense (including the infinitive and present participle), so the weak versus strong distinction only matters for the past tense.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the endings:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Infinitive\n| colspan=\"3\" | -en\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Indicative mood\n|-\n|\n! Present\n! Weak past\n! Strong past\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n| -\n| -de, -te\n| -\n|-\n! 2nd sing.

Present\n! Weak past\n! Strong past\n|-\n!\n| -end\n| ge- -d, ge- -t\n| ge- -en\n|}\n\nWeak verbs are the most common type of verb in Dutch, and the only productive type (all newly created verbs are weak). They form their past tense with an ending containing a [[dental consonant]], ''-d-'' or ''-t-''. Which of the two is used depends on the final consonant of the verb stem. If the stem ends in a [[voiceless]] consonant, then ''-t-'' is used, otherwise ''-d-''. It is often summarised with the [[mnemonic]] \"[['t kofschip]]\": if the verb stem ends with one of the consonants of ''[['t kofschip]]'' (''t, k, f, s, ch, p''), then the past tense will have ''-t-''. However, it also applies for ''c'', ''q'' and ''x'' and any other letter that is voiceless in pronunciation.\n\n* ''wer'''k'''en, wer'''kt'''e'' (\"to work, worked\")\n* ''le'''r'''en, lee'''rd'''e'' (\"to learn/teach, learned/taught\")\n* ''ra'''z'''en, raa'''sd'''e'' (\"to rage, raged\")\n* ''los'''s'''en, lo'''st'''e'' (\"to lose/get rid of, lost\")\n\nStrong verbs are less common in Dutch, but they include many of the most common verbs. They form their past tenses by changing the vowel of the stem ([[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]). For strong verbs one needs to learn three or four [[principal parts]]: the infinitive, the past (singular), optionally the past plural, and the past participle. However, the vowel patterns are often predictable and can be divided into seven or so classes, based on the vowels used in these three principal parts. Some verbs are a mixture of two classes.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''rijden, reed, gereden'' (\"ride, rode, ridden\", class 1)\n* ''binden, bond, gebonden'' (\"bind, bound, bound\", class 3a)\n* ''geven, gaf, gegeven'' (\"give, gave, given\", class 5)\n* ''lopen, liep, gelopen'' (\"walk/run, walked, walked\", class 7b)\n\nA number of verbs mix the strong and weak types of past. They have a strong past participle but all the other past tense forms are weak, or the other way around.\n\n* ''lachen, lachte, gelachen'' (\"laugh, laughed, laughed\", weak past, strong past participle)\n* ''zouten, zoutte, gezouten'' (\"salt, salted, salted\", weak past, strong past participle)\n* ''vragen, vroeg, gevraagd'' (\"ask, asked, asked\", strong past, weak past participle)\n\nSome of the most used verbs in the Dutch language have irregular conjugations which don't follow the normal rules. This includes especially the preterite-present verbs. These verbs historically had present tense forms that resembled the past tenses of strong verbs, and can be recognised in modern Dutch by the absence of the ''-t'' in the third-person singular present (the English equivalents lack the ''-s'' in the same way). Preterite-present verbs have weak past tenses, but often irregularly formed. Many of these verbs are now used as auxiliary verbs.\n\nThe additional ''-t'' of the second-person ''gij''-form is optional in the past tense for weak verbs and is usually considered archaic. For strong verbs, the -t is always required.<ref>http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/343/gij_had_hadt/</ref><ref>http://www.vrt.be/taal/gij</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://taalhelden.org/bericht/kwaamt-en-werdt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230235057/http://taalhelden.org/bericht/kwaamt-en-werdt |archive-date=2015-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Non-finite forms===\n\nDutch possesses present and past [[participle]]s.\n\n====Present participle====\n\nThe present participle is always progressive in meaning, and indicates that something is performing the action as the subject. It is usually used as an attributive adjective, and inflects as such as well.\n\n* ''Ik heb een '''vallende''' ster gezien.'' (\"I saw a '''falling''' star.\")\n* '''''Blaffende''' honden bijten niet.'' (\"'''Barking''' dogs don't bite.\")\n* ''Het nieuws verspreidt zich als een '''lopend''' vuurtje.'' (\"The news spreads like wildfire.\" &mdash; literally \"like a '''running''' fire\")\n\nIt can also be used as an adverb, meaning \"while ...ing\". Either the uninflected or inflected form can be used, although the uninflected form is more common outside set phrases.\n\n* ''Al '''doende''' leert men.'' (\"One learns '''while doing'''.\")\n* ''Dit werk is zo makkelijk, ik word '''slapend''' rijk.'' (\"This work is so easy, I'm getting rich '''while sleeping'''.\")\n* '''''Huilend''' vertelde de jongen wat er die dag gebeurd was.'' (\"'''Crying''', the boy told what had happened that day.\")\n\nRarely, the present participle is used as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], to indicate progressive actions as in English, such as ''De bal was '''rollende'''.'' (\"The ball was '''rolling'''.\"). This is usually associated with a stilted or overly formal style. It is more usual to use ''aan het'' plus the infinitive.\n\nThe present participle of a transitive verb can be preceded by an object or an adverb. Often, the space between the two words is replaced with a hyphen or removed altogether, creating a compound adjective.\n* ''Ik zat vast in '''langzaam rijdend''' verkeer.'' (\"I was stuck in '''slow-moving''' traffic.\")\n* ''Het hondje slaakte een '''hartverscheurende''' kreet.'' (\"The little dog let out a '''heart-rending''' cry.\")\n* '''''Stenengooiende''' jongeren zijn een steeds ernstiger probleem.'' (\"'''Rock-throwing''' youths are an increasingly severe problem.\")\n\n====Past participle====\n\nThe past participle indicates completed actions. It is also used to form the [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and the [[Passive voice|passive]] voice with a variety of auxiliary verbs. The formation of these is discussed in the section \"periphrastic forms\".\n\nAs an adjective, the meaning of the past participle can be either active (having performed the action) or passive (having undergone the action), depending on the type of verb:\n\n* For transitive verbs, the meaning is passive. Examples:\n** ''De '''gemaakte''' keuze bleek niet zo geweldig.'' (\"The '''made''' choice (the choice '''that had been made''') turned out to be not so great.\")\n** '''''Gebroken''' glas is gevaarlijk.'' (\"'''Broken''' glass is dangerous.\")\n* For [[unaccusative]] intransitive verbs, the meaning is active. Examples:\n** ''De '''gevallen''' man kon niet meer opstaan.'' (\"The '''fallen''' man could not get back up again.\")\n** ''Iedereen ging op zoek naar het '''verdwenen''' hondje.'' (\"Everyone went looking for the dog '''that had disappeared'''.\")\n* For [[unergative]] intransitive verbs, the past participle cannot be used as an adjective at all. These participles can not be used with a copula such as ''zijn'' (\"to be\") either, but only to form the perfect.\n\nLike present participles, past participles can be preceded by an adverb.\n* '''''Haastig gemaakte''' keuzes leiden later vaak tot problemen.'' (\"'''Hastily-made''' choices often lead to problems later.\")\n* ''Ik heb het liefst '''versgemaakt''' sinaasappelsap.'' (\"I prefer '''freshly-made''' orange juice.\")\n* '''''Jong geleerd''' is '''oud gedaan'''.'' (\"'''Learned young''' is '''done old'''.\", a proverb)\n\n====Infinitive====\n\n=====Verb phrases=====\nThe infinitive can be used in larger verb phrases with an [[auxiliary verb]] or [[modal verb]], much as in English. Like present participles, the infinitive can be accompanied by an object or adverb.\n\n*''Ik kan de auto '''zien'''.'' (\"I can '''see''' the car\")\n\n=====Verbal noun=====\nThe infinitive also doubles as a verbal noun, corresponding to the [[English gerund]] in ''-ing''. The infinitive, when used as a noun, is neuter and has no plural. Dutch also has a feminine gerund in ''-ing'', but this is no longer productive and usually has a concrete, technical meaning, e.g. ''het lenen'' \u2018borrowing, lending\u2019 vs. ''de lening'' \u2018loan\u2019; ''het opleiden'' \u2018educating\u2019 vs. ''opleiding'' \u2018education\u2019. \n\n* ''Het '''doden''' van mensen is verboden.'' - \u2018The killing of people is forbidden\u2019, or less literally \u2018Killing people is forbidden\u2019.\n* ''Ik heb een hekel aan '''wachten'''.'' - \u2018I hate waiting.\u2019\n\nIn the past, the infinitive was inflected for the dative and genitive. There are a few remnants of the latter, e.g. in:\n\n* ''Tot zien'''s'''!'' - \u2018See you!\u2019\n* ''Een uur gaan'''s'''''. - \u2018A distance that can be walked in one hour.\u2019\n\nIt also occurs in expressions involving ''tot ... toe'' (until ... resulted):\n\n* ''Hij werd tot bloeden'''s''' toe geslagen.'' - \u2018He was beaten until bleeding resulted.\u2019\n\n=====Impersonal imperative=====\nThe infinitive is also commonly used as a kind of impersonal or polite imperative (''infinitivus pro imperativo''). This often has a meaning much like the English \u201cone must (not)\u2026\u201d or \u201cplease do (not)\u2026\u201d and can be used to soften a direct command into more of a strong request, or to make the command more general (e.g. on signs and in written instructions) rather than directed at the listener or reader at that specific moment in time. The distinction is not always clear, and often both the infinitive and the imperative may be used without a strong difference in meaning.\n\n* ''Niet '''roken''''' \u2018No smoking\u2019 (or less literally \u2018please refrain from smoking\u2019), versus ''rook niet'' \u2018don't smoke!\u2019.\n* ''Hier '''betalen''''' \u2018Pay here\u2019, alternatively ''betaal hier''.\n* '''''Schudden''' voor gebruik'' \u2018Shake before use\u2019.\n\n=====With ''te''=====\nThe infinitive is often preceded by the preposition ''te'', analogous to the phrase ''to'' + verb in English. It is used in combination with certain verbs like ''beginnen'' \u2018to begin\u2019.\n\n* ''Hij begon '''te hoesten''''' (\"He started '''to cough'''\")\n\nIn combination with ''zijn'' \u2018to be\u2019 it can express a potentiality.\n\n* ''Dat was '''te verwachten'''''  (\"That was '''to be expected'''\").\n\nThe extended form can be used as an adjective:\n\n* ''De '''te verwachten''' menigte'' (\"The crowd '''that is to be expected'''\")\n\nBut it can still carry adverbial expressions or objects:\n\n*''De '''in dat geval te verwachten''' menigte'' (\"The crowd '''that is be expected in that case'''\").\n\nCompound infinitives also exist for the perfect and the future, as well as for the passive voice of transitive verbs, and they can be used to form abridged dependent clauses.\n\n*''Hij beloofde dat '''te zullen betalen'''.'' (\"He promised '''that he would pay''' that\")\n\n===Transitivity===\n\nDepending on meaning and use, Dutch verbs belong to one of a handful of '''transitivity classes''':\n* '''[[Unergative verb|Unergative]]''' [[intransitive verb]]s do not take a [[grammatical object]], and have [[active voice|active]] meaning (the subject is the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]]). The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''hebben''. They possess an impersonal passive voice.\n* '''[[Unaccusative verb|Unaccusative]]''' intransitive verbs do not take a grammatical object, and have [[passive voice|passive]] or [[middle voice|middle]] meaning (the subject is the [[patient]] or there is no clear agent). The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''zijn''.\n* '''[[Transitive verb|Transitive]]''' verbs take a grammatical object. The subject is the agent, the object is either direct (patient) or indirect. The passive voice is formed with the auxiliary ''worden''. The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''hebben'' when the direct object becomes subject, and with the auxiliary ''krijgen'' when the indirect object becomes subject. The perfect passive is formed with ''zijn''.\n* '''[[Ditransitive verb|Ditransitive]]''' verbs take two grammatical objects, a direct object (patient) and an indirect object. These act like transitive verbs in most respects.\n* '''Middle verbs''', also called '''verbs of innocence''', are essentially transitive unaccusative verbs, and take a grammatical object. The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''zijn'', while the passive is formed with ''worden'' and the perfect passive also with ''zijn''. The use of the perfect auxiliary ''zijn'' carries an implication that the subject is not the direct initiator of the action or cannot or does not want to be held responsible for it. This includes verbs such as ''vergeten'' \"to forget\" and ''verliezen'' \"to lose (an object)\".\n* '''Reflexive verbs''' are accompanied by a reflexive pronoun as object\n* '''Impersonal verbs''' only take an indefinite pronoun ''het'' (it) as subject\n* '''Absolute verbs''' are similar to unergatives, but they lack an impersonal passive form\n\nVerbs can belong to several classes at once, depending on use. Specifically, many transitive verbs can also be used intransitively, and are thus [[ambitransitive]]. For example, ''ik eet een appel'' \"I eat an apple\" contains a transitive verb, while ''ik eet'' \"I eat\" contains an unergative intransitive verb. Most ditransitive verbs can also be used as monotransitives (with only one object, direct or indirect) or even intransitives.\n\nWhether an intransitive use is unergative or unaccusative depends both on the verb and on the meaning in which it is used. Generally, most transitive verbs become unergatives when the object is removed; these are [[accusative verb]]s. But there is also a sizable number of so-called [[ergative verb]]s, which become unaccusative when there is no object. Consequently, these verbs switch from active to either passive or middle meaning when the object is dropped. Examples exist in both Dutch and English, such as the transitive ''ik breek het glas'' \"I break the glass\" versus unaccusative ''het glas breekt'' \"the glass breaks\". In both cases, the glass is the patient, but in the first case it's the direct object while in the second it's the subject. The auxiliary ''zijn'' of such verbs is used for both passive and intransitive use, making those uses essentially indistinguishable. The phrase ''het glas is gebroken'' can be interpreted as both \"the glass has been broken\" and \"the glass is broken\".\n\nAlongside the normal conjugated verb forms, Dutch has a variety of verbal meanings that are expressed using auxiliary verbs or other additional words. The use of auxiliary verbs, particularly of the perfect tenses and the passive voice -if extant-, depends on the transitivity class of the verb.\n\n====Perfect, future and passive====\n\nThe [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] indicates that an action is complete. In Dutch the completion can take place in present, past, present future or past future:\n\n*''Ik heb gegeten'' \u2018I ate\u2019, literally \u2018I have eaten\u2019 \u2013 present perfect (with simple past meaning)\n*''Ik had gegeten'' \u2018I had eaten\u2019 or \u2018I had been eating\u2019 \u2013 past perfect (with pluperfect meaning)\n*''Ik zal gegeten hebben'' \u2018I will have eaten\u2019 \u2013 future perfect\n*''Ik zou gegeten hebben'' \u2018I would have eaten\u2019 \u2013 past conditional (either as [[Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Future-in-the-past|future-in-the-past]] or conditional mood)\n\nThe future tenses all take the auxiliary verb ''zullen'', cognate with English ''shall''.\nThe [[passive voice]] indicates that the subject undergoes the action rather than performing it itself. Both categories are formed with a variety of auxiliary verbs. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Verb type\n! Present\n! Perfect\n! Passive\n!

In general these are verbs that describe a process (e.g. to happen, melt, die) rather than an action. That means that there is no (clear) actor involved.\n\nAs in English, ergative verbs can occur both in a transitive (I break the glass) and in an unaccusative mode (the glass breaks). In Dutch the perfect of the latter takes ''zijn'' \u2018to be\u2019, so that ''het glas is gebroken'' can either be seen as a perfect passive or as a perfect unaccusative. Dutch differs from German in that the latter language would add the participle ''worden'' to the passive sentence: ''Das Glas is gebrochen '''worden'''''.\n\nUnergatives in general do possess passive forms, but they are ''impersonal''.  They typically take the adverb ''er'' as a dummy subject and are hard to translate directly into English. ''Er wordt geblaft'' means something like \u2018There\u2019s barking going on\u2019 or \u2018There\u2019s some dog barking\u2019. Impersonal constructions of this kind are quite common in the language. The passives of transitive verbs can also be given an impersonal flavor by adding the dummy adverb ''er'', provided the subject is indefinite, e.g. ''Er worden dozen geopend'' \u2018There are boxes being opened\u2019 or \u2018Boxes are being opened\u2019. \n\nVerbs of motion like ''lopen'' \u2018to walk\u2019, ''zwemmen'' \u2018to swim\u2019, ''rijden'' \u2018to ride, drive\u2019 typically occur as unaccusative / unergative pairs. If the motion is directional it is seen as a ''process'' and the auxiliary is ''zijn''. If the motion is not directional it is seen as an action and the auxiliary verb is ''hebben'', unless the verb is used in the impersonal passive in which case it can take ''worden'' and ''zijn''.\n;directional\n*''Ik loop naar huis'' \u2013 \u2018I am walking home\u2019\n*''Ik '''ben''' naar huis gelopen'' \u2013 \u2018I walked home\u2019\n;non-directional\n*''Ik loop veel'' \u2013 \u2018I walk a lot\u2019\n*''Ik '''heb''' veel gelopen'' \u2013 \u2018I walked a lot\u2019\n*''Er '''wordt''' veel gelopen'' \u2013 \u2018There is a lot of walking going on\u2019\nNote also that the meanings of the formations that use ''zijn'' correspond to the meaning of the past participle when used as an adjective. Thus, unergative verbs can never use ''zijn'' as the auxiliary as their past participles cannot be used as adjectives. Furthermore, for ergative verbs, the passive does not differ significantly in meaning from the regular intransitive present tense. This is also true of English: a glass that ''breaks'' is a glass that ''is (being) broken''.\n\nThe forms listed above can occur in both present and past tense. The table lists the present tense forms, while the past tense is formed by conjugating the auxiliary verb in the past tense. Thus, this creates ''Ik '''had''' de doos '''geopend'''.'' \u2018I '''had opened''' the box.\u2019 and so on.\n\nWhen the perfect is created from a phrase that already uses an auxiliary verb, the auxiliary gets used in the infinitive form, rather than the past participle. Some auxiliary verbs even have no past participle due to this. For example:\n* ''Ik '''zal''' morgen komen.'' \u2018I '''will''' come tomorrow.\u2019 \u2192 ''Ik '''had''' morgen '''zullen''' komen.'' \u2018I '''had been going to''' come tomorrow.\u2019\n* ''Hij '''moet''' de deur sluiten.'' \u2018He '''has to''' close the door.\u2019 \u2192 ''Hij '''heeft''' de deur '''moeten''' sluiten.'' \u2018He '''has had to''' close the door.\u2019\n\n=====Ditransitive verbs=====\nDitransitive verbs carry both a direct and an indirect object. In English both objects can become the subject of a passive construction and the same auxiliary is used to form it:\n\n*I give the man a book\n*The man '''is''' given a book by me\n*A book '''is''' given to the man by me.\n\nIn Dutch a verb like ''schenken'' (to donate) follows a similar pattern but the auxiliary ''krijgen'' (to get) is used for the pseudo-passive construction that renders the indirect object into the subject, whereas ''worden'' is used for passive involving the direct object:\n\n*Ik schenk de man een boek\n*De man '''krijgt''' van mij een boek geschonken\n*Een boek '''wordt''' door mij aan de man geschonken.\n\nThe following three groups of verbs only take the auxiliary ''hebben'' in the perfect tenses\n\n=====Impersonal verbs=====\nImpersonal verbs have no true subject, but use a dummy subject pronoun ''het'' (\"it\"). These verbs often refer to conditions, such as the weather:\n* ''Het regent.'' (\"It rains.\" or \"It is raining.\")\n* ''Het onweert.'' (\"A thunderstorm is happening.\")\n\n=====Reflexive verbs=====\nReflexive verbs take a reflexive pronoun like ''me'', ''je'' or ''zich'' as their (dummy) direct object and take ''hebben'' in the perfect. This contrasts with e.g. French, where \u00eatre (to be) is used as perfect auxiliary.\n\n*Ik vergiste me  (I mistook, made an error)\n*Ik heb me vergist \n\nSome of these occur in pairs with a transitive form, replacing the unaccusative component of an ergative.\n\n*Ratten verbreiden de ziekte \u2013 -(Rats spread the disease)\n*De ziekte verbreidt zich \u2013 (The disease is spreading)\n\nThere are no verbs that ''only'' occur in a reciprocal form, but those that can take the reciprocal pronoun ''elkaar'' (each other) also take ''hebben'' in the perfect, thus behaving like reflexive ones.\n\n*Massa's trekken elkaar aan. - (Masses attract each other.)\n*De magneten hadden elkaar aangetrokken - (The magnets had attracted each other).\n\n=====Absolute verbs=====\nThese verbs resemble the unergative ones, except that they do not possess an impersonal passive.\n\n*De zon schijnt \u2013 (The sun shines)\n* *Er wordt geschenen <- does not exist-->\n\nSome of them may carry a direct object, but they have neither a personal, nor an impersonal passive:\n\n*Een jas aanhebben \u2013 (To wear a coat)\n* *Een jas wordt aangehad <-does not exist->\n\nSimilarly the past participle cannot be used as adjective:\n\n* *De aangehadde jas <-does not exist->\n\n====Future====\n\nAlthough the present tense can be used to indicate future events, there is also a more explicit future tense in Dutch. It is formed using the auxiliary ''zullen'' (\"will, shall, be going to\"), which can be conjugated in both present and past tense. The \"past future\" carries a sense having pledged or promised to do something, or having been expected to do it, much as \"was/were going to\" does in English.\n\n* ''Ik '''zal''' het morgen doen.'' (\"I '''will''' do it tomorrow.\" or \"I '''am going to''' do it tomorrow.\")\n* ''Je '''zou''' gisteren de ramen schoonmaken!'' (\"You '''were going to''' clean the windows yesterday!\")\n\nAn alternative future tense is formed using ''gaan'' (\"to go\") as the auxiliary. It is used in its literal meaning to indicate that one is moving to a place to perform an action, or is intending to do so (\"be going to go\"). More generally, it can indicate any kind of intention or plan to perform the action. It can also imply the start of an action in the future.\n\n* ''Ik '''ga''' morgen met mijn vriendinnen winkelen.'' (\"I'm '''going to go''' shopping with my friends tomorrow.\")\n* ''Voor vandaag is het werk klaar; morgen '''gaan''' ze verder werken.'' (\"For today the work is done; tomorrow they're '''going to''' continue working.\")\n* ''Het '''gaat''' zo hard regenen.'' (\"It's '''going to start''' raining hard in a moment.\")\n\n====Conditional====\n\nThe [[conditional mood]] is formed using the past tense of ''zullen'', which is ''zou'' in the singular and ''zouden'' in the plural. It is therefore somewhat analogous to the use of ''would'' in English, as the past tense of the future auxiliary ''will''. The conditional is identical in form to the \"past future\" described above, but is always accompanied by some kind of condition that the verb depends on, usually introduced with conjunctions like ''als'' (\"if\").\n\n* ''Ik '''zou''' dat niet doen als ik jou was.'' (\"I '''would''' not do that if I were you.\")\n* ''Hij '''zou''' de ramen niet hebben schoongemaakt, als ze niet vies waren.'' (\"He '''would''' not have cleaned the windows, if they were not dirty.\")\n\n====Progressive====\n\nThe [[progressive aspect]] indicates that an action is ongoing and in progress. It is formed using ''zijn'' + ''aan het'' + infinitive of action verb. It is equivalent to the English \u2018be \u2026-ing\u2019 or \u2018be in the middle of \u2026-ing\u2019, but is not used as often.\n\n* ''Je zult even moeten wachten, ik '''ben''' nu '''aan het eten'''.'' \u2018You'll have to wait (a while), I '''am eating''' now.\u2019\n* ''Hij '''was''' de ramen '''aan het schoonmaken''' toen de telefoon ging.'' \u2018He '''was cleaning''' the windows when the phone rang.\u2019\n\nUnlike in English, the progressive cannot be combined with the perfect to make a hypothetical \"perfect progressive\". Both \"I have been eating\" and \"I had been eating\" are expressed using the simple past tense form of the progressive: ''Ik '''was aan het eten'''.''\n\nA similar expression is ''bezig'' + ''zijn te'' + infinitive of action verb or ''bezig zijn met'' + action noun.\n\n* ''Hij '''is bezig''' de klok '''te repareren'''.'' \u2018He\u2019s (busy) repairing the clock\u2019.\n** Or: ''Hij '''is bezig met''' de reparatie van de klok.'' \u2018Idem\u2019.\n* ''Je '''bent''' de hele dag '''bezig met''' dat kind '''te helpen'''.'' \u2018You\u2019re spending the whole day helping that child.\u2019 (notice the superfluous ''met'' which is colloquial).\n\nA different way to render progressive aspect is to use the (static) verbs ''zitten'' \u2018to sit\u2019, ''lopen'' \u2018to walk\u2019, ''staan'' \u2018to stand\u2019 and ''liggen'' \u2018to lie\u2019 with ''te'' + infinitive. These verbs, when in the perfect, all use a double infinitive.\n* ''Ik '''zit te eten'''.''  - \u2018I\u2019m sat down eating\u2019 (UK) or \u2018I\u2019m sitting here eating\u2019 (North America).\n* ''Ik '''sta''' de ramen '''schoon te maken'''.'' - \u2018I\u2019m stood (here) cleaning windows\u2019 (UK) or \u2018I\u2019m standing here cleaning windows\u2019 (North America).\n* ''Jantje '''ligt te slapen'''.''  - \u2018Jantje is sleeping\u2019.\n\nThe literal meaning of the verbs ''to sit'' or ''to stand'' etc. is often secondary to their durative aspect.\n\n==Numerals==\nDutch uses a [[decimal]] numeral system. Numerals are not inflected.\n\n===0-9===\nThe numbers from 0 to 9 are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9\n|-\n| nul || een || twee || drie || vier || vijf || zes || zeven || acht || negen\n|}\n\nNote that ''een'' is the same word as the indefinite article in the written language. When confusion is possible, the number is often written as ''\u00e9\u00e9n'' to distinguish it from the article. The pronunciation differentiates them in speech: the article is {{IPA|/\u0259n/}}, the numeral is {{IPA|/e\u02d0n/}}.\n\n===10-19===\n\nThe numbers 10, 11 and 12 are irregular. 13 to 19 are formed by adding ''-tien'' (\"-teen\") to the base number. Two are slightly irregular: 13 is ''d'''er'''tien'' with [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] (compare English ''th'''ir'''teen''), and 14 is ''v'''ee'''rtien''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 10 !! 11 !! 12 !! 13 !! 14 !! 15 !! 16 !! 17 !! 18 !! 19\n|-\n| tien || elf || twaalf || dertien || veertien || vijftien || zestien || zeventien || achttien || negentien\n|}\n\n===20-99===\n\nThe decades 20 to 90 are formed by adding ''-tig'' (\"-ty\") to the base number. However, some are slightly irregular: 20 is ''tw'''in'''tig'', 30 and 40 are ''d'''er'''tig'' and ''v'''eer'''tig'' (comparable to 13 and 14 above), 80 is '''''t'''achtig''. The remaining decades, although spelled beginning with ''v'' and ''z'', are often pronounced beginning with voiceless {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} even in dialects that do not devoice these consonants normally.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 10 !! 20 !! 30 !! 40 !! 50 !! 60 !! 70 !! 80 !! 90\n|-\n| tien || twintig || dertig || veertig || vijftig || zestig || zeventig || tachtig || negentig\n|}\n\nCombinations of a decade and a unit are constructed in a regular way: the unit comes first, followed by ''en'' (\"and\"), followed by the decade. No spaces are written between them, and a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] is added when necessary. For example:\n\n* 28 ''achtentwintig'' (\"eight and twenty\")\n* 83 ''drie\u00ebntachtig'' (\"three and eighty\")\n* 99 ''negenennegentig'' (\"nine and ninety\")\n\n===Hundreds===\n\n100 is ''honderd''. Multiples of 100 are expressed by placing the multiple before ''honderd'', without any spaces: 200 ''tweehonderd'', 300 ''driehonderd'' and so on. Sometimes multiples higher than 10 can be used as synonyms for the thousands, such as 1100 ''elfhonderd'', 2500 ''vijfentwintighonderd''.\n\nCombinations of a hundred and a lower number are expressed by just placing them together, with the hundred coming first. Sometimes, ''en'' is added in between, but this is optional and not commonly done nowadays.\n\n* 112 ''honderdtwaalf'' or ''honderdentwaalf''\n* 698 ''zeshonderdachtennegentig''\n* 1258 ''twaalfhonderdachtenvijftig''\n\n===Thousands===\n\n1000 is ''duizend''. Unlike in English, this is not preceded by an article. The same system used for naming the hundreds applies to the thousands as well, so multiples of 1000 are expressed by writing the multiple right before: 2000 ''tweeduizend'', 3000 ''drieduizend'', 20000 ''twintigduizend'', 999000 ''negenhonderdnegenennegentigduizend''.\n\nCombinations of a thousand and a lower number are expressed by placing them together, with the thousand coming first. A space is written between them.\n\n* 1 258 ''duizend tweehonderdachtenvijftig''\n* 9 001 ''negenduizend een''\n* 32 348 ''twee\u00ebndertigduizend driehonderdachtenveertig''\n* 123 456 ''honderddrie\u00ebntwintigduizend vierhonderdzesenvijftig''\n\n===Millions and above===\n\nDutch always uses the [[long and short scales|long scale system]].\n\n* 1 000 000 ''[[1000000 (number)|miljoen]]''\n* 1 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000 (number)|miljard]]''\n* 1 000 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000000 (number)|biljoen]]''\n* 1 000 000 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000000000 (number)|biljard]]''\n* etc.\n\nMultiples of any of these are similar to the thousands, but a space is written between the multiple and the \"million\": 2 000 000 ''twee miljoen'', 420 000 000 000 ''vierhonderdtwintig miljard''. If the multiple is 1, it must also be present, unlike with the thousands where it is left out: 1 000 000 ''een miljoen''.\n\nCombinations with lower numbers are much the same as with the thousands.\n\n* 117 401 067 ''honderdzeventien miljoen vierhonderdeenduizend zevenenzestig''\n* 10 987 654 321 ''tien miljard negenhonderdzevenentachtig miljoen zeshonderdvierenvijftigduizend driehonderdeenentwintig''\n\n===Ordinal numbers===\n\nOrdinal numbers behave and inflect like superlative adjectives. They always appear in the inflected form, always ending in ''-e'', and are usually preceded by a definite article of some kind.\n\nThe ordinal adjectives are formed by adding either ''-de'' or ''-ste'' to the base number. Which one is added depends on the word. The numbers 1 and 3 have irregular ordinals.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 1st !! 2nd !! 3rd !! 4th !! 5th !! 6th !! 7th !! 8th !! 9th\n|-\n| eer'''st'''e || twee'''d'''e || der'''d'''e || vier'''d'''e || vijf'''d'''e || zes'''d'''e || zeven'''d'''e || acht'''st'''e || negen'''d'''e\n|-\n! 10th !! 11th !! 12th !! 13-19th !! 20-90th !! 100th !! 1 000th !! 1 000 000th+ !! 1 000 000 000th+\n|-\n| tien'''d'''e || elf'''d'''e || twaalf'''d'''e || -tien'''d'''e || -tig'''st'''e || honderd'''st'''e || duizend'''st'''e || -joen'''st'''e || -jard'''st'''e\n|}\n\nWhen a number is composed of multiple parts, the ending is added only to the last part of the word, and follows the rules for that word. Thus, 21st ''eenentwintig'''st'''e'', 409th ''vierhonderdnegen'''d'''e'', 9001st ''negenduizend eer'''st'''e''.\n\n===Fractional numbers===\n\nFractional numbers are expressed using a cardinal number for the numerator, and an ordinal for the denominator, like in English.\n* 1/5 ''een vijfde''\n* 3/8 ''drie achtste''\n1/2 and 1/4 are ''een half'' (\"a half\") and ''een kwart'' (\"a quarter\") respectively, although the regular ''een tweede'' and ''een vierde'' are also possible, but rarer. In 3/4, the space is often left out: ''driekwart''.\n\nWhen combined with a full cardinal, the full cardinal comes first and they are separated by ''en'' and spaces. The word ''en'' can be left out if the numerator is not 1.\n* 9 3/4 ''negen (en) driekwart''\n* 5 1/6 ''vijf en een zesde''\n* 3 1/2 ''drie en een half''\nThe combination 1 1/2 is usually expressed irregularly as ''anderhalf'', which literally means \"other half\" (''ander'' was originally a synonym of ''tweede'', and this combination meant \"second, minus a half\").\n\n===Iterative numbers===\n\nThese express repetition, like \"once\" or \"five times\". They are formed with a cardinal number followed by ''maal'' or ''keer'' (both meaning \"times\").\n* ''twee maal/keer'' (\"two times, twice\")\n* ''negen maal/keer'' (\"nine times\")\n* ''honderd maal/keer'' (\"a hundred times\")\nThe space is often left out for the combinations ''eenmaal'' (\"once\"), ''tweemaal'' (\"twice\") and ''driemaal'' (\"thrice\"), but not with ''keer''.\n\nThere are also ordinal forms of these, which express an iteration within a sequence of repetitions. They are formed with an ordinal instead of a cardinal, and act as masculine nouns.\n* ''de eerste keer/maal'' (\"the first time\")\n* ''de dertigste keer/maal'' (\"the thirtieth time\")\n\n===Multiplicative numbers===\n\nThese express a multiple of something. They are formed with the suffix ''-voud'' \u2018-fold\u2019 and are neuter nouns.\n* ''tweevoud'' \u2018a twofold, multiple of two\u2019\n* ''drievoud'' \u2018a threefold, multiple of three\u2019\n* ''honderdvoud'' \u2018a hundredfold, multiple of hundred\u2019\nFor the number 1, ''enkelvoud'' \u2018singular(ity), a onefold\u2019 is used, which is derived from ''enkel'' \u2018single\u2019 rather than ''een''. The \"regular\" form ''eenvoud'' instead means \u2018simpleness, uncomplicatedness, ease\u2019.\n\nAdjectives are formed by adding ''-ig'' to this, giving the combination ''-voudig''.\n* ''tweevoudig'' \u2018double, twofold\u2019\n* ''drievoudig'' \u2018triple, threefold\u2019\n* ''honderdvoudig'' \u2018hundredfold\u2019\nAgain, ''enkelvoudig'' \u2018single, simple, onefold\u2019 is used for 1, and ''eenvoudig'' means \u2018simple, uncomplicated, easy\u2019. Alternatively, the word ''enkel'' \u2018single\u2019 can be used alone. A synonym for ''tweevoudig'' is ''dubbel''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dutch declension]]\n*[[Dutch conjugation]]\n*[[DT-Manie]]\n\n== References ==\n*Aarts, Florent G.A.M. & Herman Wekker.

Changes from single to double letters are common when discussing Dutch grammar, but they are entirely predictable once one knows how the spelling rules work.{{cn|date=July 2018}} This means that the spelling alternations do not form part of the grammar, and they are not discussed here. For more information, see [[Dutch orthography]].\n\n==Word order==\n\nDutch word order is underlyingly [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] (subject\u2013object\u2013verb). There is an additional rule called [[V2 word order|V2]] in main clauses, which moves the finite (inflected for subject) verb into the second position in the sentence. Because of this, sentences with only one verb appear with [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] (subject\u2013verb\u2013object) or [[Verb\u2013subject\u2013object|VSO]] (verb\u2013subject\u2013object) order.\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Jan||hielp||zijn moeder\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Jan||helped||his mother\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Jan helped his mother.\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Gisteren||hielp||Jan||zijn moeder\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n| Yesterday||helped||Jan||his mother\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Yesterday, Jan helped his mother.\"\n|}\n\nHowever, any other verbs or verbal particles are placed at the end of the clause in accordance with the underlying SOV order, giving an intermediate order of SVOV(V)(V)...\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Jan||wilde||zijn moeder||gaan helpen\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Jan||wanted||his mother||to go help\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Jan wanted to go help his mother.\"\n|}\n\nIn subordinate clauses, the order is exclusively SOV.<ref>Jan Koster: \"[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/kost006dutc01/kost006dutc01_001.htm Dutch as an SOV Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413224259/http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/kost006dutc01/kost006dutc01_001.htm |date=2005-04-13 }}\", ''Linguistic analysis'' 1 (1975), p. 111-136.</ref><ref>http://www.let.rug.nl/~zwart/college/docs/zinsleer/zinsleer6.pdf</ref> In subordinate clauses two word orders are possible for the verb clusters and are referred to as the \"red\": ''omdat ik heb gewerkt'', \"because I have worked\": like in English, where the auxiliary verb precedes the past particle, and the \"green\": ''omdat ik gewerkt heb'', where the past particle precedes the auxiliary verb, \"because I worked have\": like in German. <ref>http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_han001200701_01/_han001200701_01_0019.php</ref> In Dutch, the green word order is most used in speech, and the red is the most used in writing, particularly in journalistic texts, but the \"green\" is also used in writing.{{cn|date=May 2019}} Unlike in English, however, adjectives and adverbs must precede the verb: ''dat het boek groen is'', \"that the book is green\". For an explanation of verb clusters of three or more see: [[V2 word order#German, Dutch, Afrikaans|V2 word order]]\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Jan||zei||dat||hij||zijn moeder||wilde||gaan helpen\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Jan||said||that||he||his mother||wanted||to go help\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Jan said that he wanted to go help his mother.\"\n|}\n\nIn yes\u2013no questions, the verb of the main clause is usually, but not always, placed first instead of second. If the verb comes second, this often implies disbelief, like in English: \"The prisoner escaped?\" vs. \"Did the prisoner escape?\"\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Hielp||Jan||zijn moeder?\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Helped||Jan||his mother?\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Did Jan help his mother?\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Wilde||Jan||zijn moeder||gaan helpen?\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|Wanted||Jan||his mother||to go help?\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Did Jan want to go help his mother?\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| Zei||Jan||dat||hij||zijn moeder||wilde||gaan helpen?\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n| Said||Jan||that||he||his mother||wanted||to go help?\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"Did Jan say that he wanted to go help his mother?\"\n|}\n\nIn imperative sentences, the verb of the main clause is always placed first, although it may be preceded by a noun phrase indicating who is being addressed.\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|(Jan,)||ga||je moeder||helpen!\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|(Jan,)||go||your mother||help!\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"(Jan,) go help your mother!\"\n|}\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n| (Jan,)||zeg||dat||je||je moeder||wilde||gaan helpen!\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n| (Jan,)||say||that||you||your mother||wanted||to go help!\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"(Jan,) say that you wanted to go help your mother!\"\n|}\n\nIn the following example, the SOV order in the subordinate clause causes the various noun phrases to be separated from the verbs that introduce them, creating a relatively deep \"nesting\" structure:\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Ik zie dat || de ouders || de kinderen || Jan || het huis || hebben || laten || helpen || schilderen.\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|I see that || the parents || the children || Jan || the house || have || let || help || paint\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"I see that the parents have let the children help Jan paint the house.\"\n|}\n\n[[Adjective]]s always come before the [[noun]] to which they belong.\n:''rode appels'' \u2013 red apples\n\nIn contrast to English, adpositional phrase come in the order [[time\u2013manner\u2013place]], so that time modifiers usually come before place modifiers:\n\n:{| style=\"font-style:italic\"\n|Ik|| ben ||dit ||jaar ||naar ||Frankrijk ||geweest\n|- style=\"font-style:normal\"\n|I|| am ||this ||year ||to ||France ||been\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-style:normal\" | \"I have been to France this year.\"\n|}\n\n==Nouns==\n{{see also|Gender in Dutch grammar}}\n\nIn Dutch, nouns are marked for [[Grammatical number|number]] in singular and plural. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] have largely fallen out of use, as have the endings that were used for them. Standard Dutch has three [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. However, in large parts of the [[Netherlands]] there is no grammatical distinction between what were originally masculine and feminine genders, and there is only a distinction between common and neuter. Gender is not overtly marked on nouns either, and must be learned for each noun.\n\n===Plural===\n\nThe [[plural]] is formed by addition of ''-en'' (pronounced {{IPA|/\u0259n/}} or {{IPA|/\u0259/}}) or ''-s'', with the usual spelling changes in the case of the former. Which of the two is used is somewhat unpredictable, although some general rules can be given:\n\n* Single-syllable words, which are common in Dutch, normally use ''-en'':\n** ''deur'' \"door\" \u2192 ''deuren''\n** ''boot'' \"boat\" \u2192 ''boten''\n** ''huis'' \"house\" \u2192 ''huizen''\n** ''dief'' \"thief\" \u2192 ''dieven''\n* Words ending in a [[schwa]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} often use ''-s'', but a sizable number uses ''-n'', particularly if they are older. Some nouns may allow either ending. Nouns that are substantivised forms of adjectives always use ''-n''.\n** ''tante'' \"aunt\" \u2192 ''tantes''\n** ''chocolade'' \"chocolate\" \u2192 ''chocolades''\n** ''bode'' \"messenger\" \u2192 ''boden'' or ''bodes''\n** ''oxide'' \"oxide\" \u2192 ''oxiden''\n** ''grote'' \"great one\" \u2192 ''groten''\n* Relatively modern words ending in a long vowel use ''-'s'' (with an apostrophe), but if they end in ''-ee'' or ''-\u00e9'' then no apostrophe is used. Older ones generally use ''-en'' or ''-\u00ebn'' (with diaeresis).\n** ''baby'' \"baby\" \u2192 ''baby's''\n** ''caf\u00e9'' \"caf\u00e9, bar, pub\" \u2192 ''caf\u00e9s''\n** ''pizza'' \"pizza\" \u2192 ''pizza's''\n** ''radio'' \"radio\" \u2192 ''radio's''\n** ''ree'' \"roe\" \u2192 ''ree\u00ebn''\n** ''la'' (also ''lade'') \"drawer\" \u2192 ''laden'' (but in colloquial usage sometimes also ''la's'')\n* Words ending in unstressed ''-el'' or ''-er'' usually use ''-s''. If ''-en'' is allowed it tends to be more archaic or poetic.\n** ''akker'' \"agricultural field\" \u2192 ''akkers''\n** ''appel'' \"apple\" \u2192 ''appels'' or (archaic) ''appelen'' (note: for the derived noun ''aardappel'' \"potato\", the plural ''aardappelen'' is still common, alongside ''aardappels'')\n** ''lepel'' \"spoon\" \u2192 ''lepels''\n** ''sleutel'' \"key\" \u2192 ''sleutels''\n** ''vader'' \"father\" \u2192 ''vaders'' or (archaic) ''vaderen''\n* Initialisms (words pronounced as letters) follow the rules for whatever the final syllable suggests, usually by adding ''-s'' but occasionally ''-en'':\n** ''APK'' \"vehicle inspection\" \u2192 ''APK's''\n** ''cd'' \"CD\" \u2192 ''cd's''\n\n====Plurals with vowel change====\n\nA number of common nouns inherited from [[Old Dutch language|Old Dutch]] have a short vowel in the singular but a long vowel in the plural. When short ''i'' is lengthened in this way, it becomes long ''e''.\n\n* ''dag'' {{IPA|/d\u0251x/}} \u2018day\u2019 \u2192 ''dagen'' {{IPA|/\u02c8da\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)/}} \u2018days\u2019\n* ''gebrek'' {{IPA|/\u0263\u0259\u02c8br\u025bk/}} \u2018lack, deficiency\u2019 \u2192 ''gebreken'' {{IPA|/\u0263\u0259\u02c8bre\u02d0k\u0259(n)/}} \u2018deficiencies\u2019\n* ''schip'' {{IPA|/sx\u026ap/}} \u2018ship\u2019 \u2192 ''schepen'' {{IPA|/\u02c8sxe\u02d0p\u0259(n)/}} \u2018ships\u2019\n* ''slot'' {{IPA|/sl\u0254t/}} \u2018lock\u2019 \u2192 ''sloten'' {{IPA|/\u02c8slo\u02d0t\u0259(n)/}} \u2018locks\u2019 (also the plural of ''sloot'' \u2018ditch\u2019)\n\nOther nouns with this change include: ''(aan)bod'' \u2018offer\u2019, ''bad'' \u2018bath\u2019, ''bedrag'' \u2018(money) contribution\u2019, ''bevel'' \u2018command\u2019, ''blad'' \u2018sheet of paper; magazine\u2019 (not \u2018leaf\u2019), ''dak'' \u2018roof\u2019, ''dal'' \u2018valley\u2019, ''gat'' \u2018hole\u2019, ''gebed'' \u2018prayer\u2019, ''gebod'' \u2018commandment\u2019, ''gen'' \u2018gene\u2019, ''glas'' \u2018glass\u2019, ''god'' \u2018god\u2019, ''hertog'' \u2018duke\u2019, ''hof'' \u2018court\u2019, ''hol'' \u2018cave; burrow\u2019, ''lid'' \u2018member\u2019, ''lot'' \u2018lottery ticket\u2019, ''oorlog'' \u2018war\u2019, ''pad'' \u2018path\u2019, ''schot'' \u2018shot\u2019, ''slag'' \u2018strike, battle\u2019, ''smid'' \u2018smith\u2019, ''spel'' \u2018large game; spectacle\u2019 (not in the sense of a smaller everyday game), ''staf'' \u2018staff\u2019, ''vat'' \u2018vat, barrel\u2019, ''verbod'' \u2018ban, prohibition\u2019, ''verdrag'' \u2018treaty\u2019, ''verlof'' \u2018permission\u2019, ''weg'' \u2018road, way\u2019.\n\nThe noun ''stad'' {{IPA|/st\u0251t/}} \u2018town, city\u2019 has [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] in the plural alongside lengthening: ''steden'' {{IPA|/\u02c8ste\u02d0d\u0259(n)/}} \u2018towns, cities\u2019. The plural of nouns ending in the suffix ''-heid'' {{IPA|/\u0266\u025bit/}} \u2018-ness, -hood\u2019 is irregular ''-heden'' {{IPA|/\u0266e\u02d0d\u0259(n)/}}.\n\n====Plurals in ''-eren''====\n\nA few neuter nouns have a plural in ''-eren''. This ending derives from the old Germanic \"z-stem\" nouns, and is cognate with the English ''-ren'' (''children'', ''brethren'' etc.). The following nouns have this type of plural:\n\n* ''been'' \"bone\" \u2192 ''beenderen'' (when used in the sense \"leg\", the plural is the regular ''benen'')\n* ''blad'' \"leaf\" \u2192 ''bladeren'' (when used in the sense \"sheet, magazine\", the plural is ''bladen'')\n* ''ei'' \"egg\" \u2192 ''eieren''\n* ''gelid'' \"rank, file\" \u2192 ''gelederen''\n* ''gemoed'' \"mood, emotion\" \u2192 ''gemoederen''\n* ''goed'' \"good\" \u2192 ''goederen''\n* ''hoen'' \"fowl\" \u2192 ''hoenderen''\n* ''kalf'' \"calf\" \u2192 ''kalveren''\n* ''kind'' \"child\" \u2192 ''kinderen''\n* ''kleed'' \"cloth\" \u2192 (archaic) ''klederen'' or ''kleren'' \"clothes\" (nowadays a [[plurale tantum]] like in English)\n* ''lam'' \"lamb\" \u2192 ''lammeren''\n* ''lied'' \"song\" \u2192 ''liederen'' (somewhat dated; the plural of the diminutive is often used instead: ''liedjes'')\n* ''rad'' \"wheel\" \u2192 ''raderen''\n* ''rund'' \"cattle\" \u2192 ''runderen''\n* ''volk'' \"people, nation\" \u2192 ''volkeren'' (the regular ''volken'' is also used)\n\nWhen used in compounds, the stem of these nouns usually includes the ''-er''. For example: ''ei'''er'''schaal'' \"eggshell\", ''kind'''er'''arbeid'' \"child labour\", ''kled'''er'''dracht'' \"traditional costume\", ''rund'''er'''tartaar'' \"beef [[tartare]]\", ''volk'''er'''moord'' \"genocide\". This is not a rule, however, and compounds with the singular form also exist: ''eivorm'' \"egg-shape\", ''rundvlees'' \"beef\", ''volk'''s'''lied'' \"national anthem\".\n\n====Foreign plurals====\n\nFor a number of nouns of Latin origin, a Latin-like plural may be used. Depending on the word and the formalness of the setting, a regular plural in ''-en'' or ''-s'' can also be used.\n\n* ''museum'' \"museum\" \u2192 ''musea'' or ''museums''\n* ''politicus'' \"politician\" \u2192 ''politici''\n\nSome modern scientific words borrowed from Latin or Greek form their plurals with vowel lengthening, like the native words listed above. These words are primarily Latin agent nouns ending in ''-or'' and names of particles ending in ''-on''. Alongside the change in vowel length, there is also a stress shift in the plural, patterned on the Latin third declension where this also occurs. In each case, the singular follows a Latin-like stress, while the plural stresses the ''-on-'' or ''-or-''. Some examples:\n\n* ''elektron'' ({{IPA|/e\u02d0\u02c8l\u025bktr\u0254n/}} \"electron\") \u2192 ''elektronen'' ({{IPA|/e\u02d0l\u025bk\u02c8tro\u02d0n\u0259(n)/}} \"electrons\")\n* ''doctor'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0254kt\u0254r/}} \"doctor (holder of a doctorate)\") \u2192 ''doctoren'' ({{IPA|/d\u0254k\u02c8to\u02d0r\u0259(n)/}} \"doctors\")\n* ''graviton'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8\u0263ra\u02d0vit\u0254n/}} \"graviton\") \u2192 ''gravitonen'' ({{IPA|/\u0263ra\u02d0vi\u02c8to\u02d0n\u0259(n)/}} \"gravitons\")\n* ''reactor'' ({{IPA|/re\u02d0\u02c8\u0251kt\u0254r/}} \"reactor\") \u2192 ''reactoren'' ({{IPA|/re\u02d0\u0251k\u02c8to\u02d0r\u0259(n)/}} \"reactors\")\n\nWords borrowed from English or French will generally form their plural in ''-s'', in imitation of the native plural of those languages. This applies especially to recent borrowings.\n\n* ''harddisk'' \u2192 ''harddisks''\n* ''bonbon'' \u2192 ''bonbons''\n\n===Diminutive===\n\nMany nouns have a [[diminutive]] form alongside the normal base form. This form is used to indicate small size, or emphasize a particular endearing quality. Use of diminutives is very common, so much that they could be considered part of the noun's inflectional paradigm.\n\nThere are two basic ways to form the diminutive: with ''-tje'' or with ''-ke(n)''. The former is the standard way, while the latter is found in some dialects, mostly in the south ([[Brabantian]] and [[Limburgish]]). The diminutive on ''-ke(n)'' is common in informal Belgian Dutch (due to final-n deletion in Dutch, the final -n is often not pronounced). All diminutives have neuter gender, no matter what the gender of the original noun was. The plural is always formed with ''-s''.\n\n====Diminutive in ''-tje''====\n\nThe basic suffix ''-tje'' is modified in different ways depending on the final sounds of the noun it is attached to.\n\nThe ''-t-'' is removed from the ending when added to words ending in a [[fricative]] or [[plosive]] (-b, -c, -d, -f, -g, -ch, -k, -p, -q, -s, -sj, -t, -v, -x, -z).\n\n* hond \u2192 hondje\n* brief \u2192 briefje\n* hok \u2192 hokje\n* vis \u2192 visje\n* douche \u2192 doucheje ({{IPA|/du\u0283/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u02c8du\u0283(j)\u0259/}})\n* race \u2192 raceje ({{IPA|/re\u02d0s/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u02c8re\u02d0sj\u0259/}} ~ {{IPA|/\u02c8re\u02d0\u0283\u0259/}})\n\nNote that the last two words really end in a consonant, despite not being spelled that way.\n\nWhen the vowel of the last syllable is both short and stressed, and it is followed by a [[sonorant]], an extra schwa ''-e-'' is inserted, giving '''-etje'''.\n* kom \u2192 kommetje\n* pil \u2192 pilletje\n* lam \u2192 lammetje\n* ding \u2192 dingetje\n* vriendin \u2192 vriendinnetje\n* baron \u2192 baronnetje\n\nIn all other cases, the basic form '''-tje''' is used. This includes:\n* Words ending in a stressed tense/long vowel or [[diphthong]].\n* Words ending in any unstressed vowel. \n* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by ''-l'', ''-n'', ''-r''.\n* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by ''-m''. The resulting combination ''-mtje'' is assimilated to '''-mpje'''.\n* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by ''-ng''. The resulting combination ''-ngtje'' is assimilated to '''-nkje'''.\n\nWhen the final vowel is long, it is doubled accordingly. Final ''-i'', which does not really occur in native Dutch words, is converted into ''-ie''. Final ''-y'' gets an apostrophe.\n\n* koe \u2192 koetje\n* auto \u2192 autootje\n* mama \u2192 mamaatje\n* vrouw \u2192 vrouwtje\n* taxi \u2192 taxietje\n* baby \u2192 baby'tje\n* school \u2192 schooltje\n* kuil \u2192 kuiltje\n* maan \u2192 maantje\n* muur \u2192 muurtje\n* appel \u2192 appeltje\n* boom \u2192 boompje\n* duim \u2192 duimpje\n* bodem \u2192 bodempje\n* koning \u2192 koninkje\n* houding \u2192 houdinkje\n\nIn the case of the vowels ''oe'' and ''ie'', there is some ambiguity. While pronounced short in many dialects, they can also be long for some speakers, so forms both with and without the extra ''-e-'' can be found.\n* bloem \u2192 bloemetje ''or'' bloempje (however ''bloemetje'' has an additional meaning: ''bouquet'')<ref>http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1195/bloem_bloempje_bloemetje/</ref>\n* wiel \u2192 wieltje ''or'' wieletje\n\n====Diminutive in ''-ke(n)''====\n\nIn the south, the ending ''-ke(n)'' is often used instead. It also has different forms depending on the preceding sounds, with rules very similar to those for the ''-tje'' ending.\n\nAn older form of this ending was ''-ken'', which is more like its German cognate ''-chen''. This form is not used much today, due to final n-deletion which is common in Dutch, but it is still found in older texts and names. A famous example is ''[[Manneken Pis]]''.\n\nWhen the word ends in a [[velar]] consonant (-g, -ch, -k, -ng), an extra [[Dissimilation|dissimilative]] ''-s-'' is inserted, giving '''-ske(n)'''.\n* dag \u2192 dagske\n* lach \u2192 lachske\n* stok \u2192 stokske\n* ding \u2192 dingske\n* koning \u2192 koningske\n\nAn extra ''-e-'' is inserted in three cases, giving '''-eke(n)''':\n* Words ending in a non-velar plosive (-p, -b, -t, -d).\n* Words ending in ''-n'', which is not a velar itself but would assimilate to one before the following ''-k-''.\n* Words ending in ''-m'', ''-l'' or ''-r'' preceded by a stressed short vowel.\n\nExamples:\n\n* hond \u2192 hondeke\n* voet \u2192 voeteke\n* map \u2192 mappeke\n* boon \u2192 boneke\n* bon \u2192 bonneke\n* kom \u2192 kommeke\n* hol \u2192 holleke\n* bar \u2192 barreke\n\nIn all other cases, the ending is the basic '''-ke(n)'''. This includes:\n* Words ending in a vowel.\n* Words ending in a non-velar [[fricative]] (-f, -v, -s, -z).\n* Words ending in ''-m'', ''-l'', ''-r'' preceded by a long vowel, [[diphthong]], or unstressed vowel.\n\nExamples:\n\n* mama \u2192 mamake\n* koe \u2192 koeke\n* slof \u2192 slofke\n* doos \u2192 dooske\n* school \u2192 schoolke\n* muur \u2192 muurke\n* boom \u2192 boomke\n* bodem \u2192 bodemke\n\n====Umlaut in diminutives====\n\nStandard Dutch, as well as most dialects, do not use [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] as a grammatical marker. However, some eastern dialects (East [[Brabantian]], [[Limburgish]] and many [[Low Saxon dialects in the Netherlands|Low Saxon]] areas) have regular umlaut of the preceding vowel in diminutives. As this is not a standard feature, it is rare in the written language except when used to evoke a local feeling. It can be more common in the spoken language. Some examples:\n\n* ''man'' \u2192 ''menneke''\n* ''boom'' \u2192 ''beumke''\n* ''pop'' \u2192 ''pupke''\n\n====Diminutives of nouns with irregular plurals====\n\nNouns with irregular plurals tend to have the same irregularity in the diminutive as well. This is not a rule, however, and both forms can often be found. For some nouns, the irregularity is more common in the plural of the diminutive, and only rarely appears in the singular. Some examples:\n\n* ''blad'' \u2018leaf; sheet of paper\u2019 \u2192 ''blaadje'' \u2018small leaf; folio\u2019, in plural also ''bladertjes''\n* ''dag'' \u2018day\u2019 \u2192 ''dagje'' \u2018short day\u2019, in plural also ''daagjes''\n* ''glas'' \u2018drinking glass\u2019 \u2192 ''glaasje'' \u2018small glass\u2019\n* ''kind'' \u2018child\u2019 \u2192 ''kindje'' \u2018toddler\u2019, in plural also ''kindertjes''\n* ''pad'' \u2018path\u2019 \u2192 ''paadje'' \u2018narrow or short path\u2019 (vs. ''pad'' \u2018toad\u2019 \u2192 ''padje'' \u2018toadlet\u2019)\n* ''rad'' \u2018wheel\u2019 \u2192 ''radje'' or ''radertje'' \u2018little wheel\u2019\n* ''schip'' \u2018ship\u2019 \u2192 ''scheepje'' \u2018little ship\u2019\n* ''spel'' \u2018game\u2019 \u2192 ''speeltje'' \u2018toy\u2019\n* ''vat'' \u2018barrel\u2019 \u2192 ''vaatje'' \u2018small barrel\u2019\n\n===Cases===\n{{main|Archaic Dutch declension}}\n\n[[Noun cases]] were still prescribed in the formal written standard up until the 1940s, but were abolished then because they had long disappeared from the spoken language. Because of this, they are nowadays restricted mostly to set phrases and are [[Archaism|archaic]]. The former Dutch case system resembled that of modern [[German language|German]], and distinguished four cases: [[Nominative case|nominative]] (subject), [[Genitive case|genitive]] (possession or relation), [[Dative case|dative]] (indirect object, object of preposition) and [[Accusative case|accusative]] (direct object, object of preposition). Only the nominative and genitive are productive, with the genitive seldom used and only surviving in the margins of the language. Some examples of the three non-nominative cases in fixed expressions:\n\n* Genitive: ''de dag '''des''' oordeel'''s''''' \"judgement day\", ''Koninkrijk '''der''' Nederlanden'' \"Kingdom of the Nederlands\"\n* Dative: ''in feit'''e''''' \"in fact\", ''heden '''ten''' dag'''e''''' \"nowadays\", ''bij deze'''n''''' \"hereby\"\n* Accusative: ''op '''den''' duur'' \"eventually\", ''goede'''n'''avond'' \"good evening\"\n\nThe role of cases has been taken over by prepositions and word order in modern Dutch. For example, the distinction between direct and indirect object is now made by placing the indirect object before the direct object, or by using the preposition ''aan'' \"to\" with the indirect object. The genitive is replaced with the preposition ''van'' \"of\". Usage of cases with prepositions has disappeared as well.\n\nCases are still occasionally used productively, which are often [[calque]]s of existing phrases. This is particularly true of the genitive case,<ref>http://www.nytud.hu/imm14/abs/scott.pdf</ref> which is still used occasionally to evoke a formal style. Speakers' awareness of how the cases were originally used is generally low. People may confuse the old masculine/neuter genitive article ''des'' and the corresponding noun ending ''-s'' with the article ''der'' (with no ending) used for feminine or plural nouns.\n\n==Articles==\n\nDutch has both a [[definite article]] (\"the\") and an [[indefinite article]] (\"a\" or \"an\").<ref>{{cite web | title=de / het: algemene regels | website=Onze Taal | date=2011-04-08 | url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/de-het-algemene-regels/ | language=nl | access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://understandingdutch.com/difference-between-de-and-het-dutch |title=Difference between de and het |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2018-05-05 |website=UnderstandingDutch.com |publisher= |access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n|-\n! Definite singular\n| '''de''' man\n| '''de''' vrouw\n| '''het''' huis\n|-\n! Definite plural\n| '''de''' mannen\n| '''de''' vrouwen\n| '''de''' huizen\n|-\n! Indefinite singular\n| '''een''' man\n| '''een''' vrouw\n| '''een''' huis\n|}\n\n''Het'' and ''een'' are normally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0259t/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259n/}}, respectively. They may sometimes also be contracted in spelling to reflect this: ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>t'', ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>n''.\n\nThere is no indefinite article in the plural, the noun is just used on its own. However, there is a negative indefinite article '''''geen''''' (\"no, not a, not any\"). Similarly to ''een'' it is invariable, showing no inflection for gender or number.\n\n* ''Dat is geen man'' (\"That is not a man\")\n* ''Dat is geen vrouw'' (\"That is not a woman\")\n* ''Dat is geen huis'' (\"That is not a house\")\n* ''Dat zijn geen mannen'' (\"Those aren't men\")\n* ''Ik heb geen water'' (\"I have no water\", \"I don't have any water\")\n\nThe articles formerly had forms for the different cases as well. See [[Archaic Dutch declension]] for more information.\n\n==Adjectives and adverbs==\n\nWithin the Dutch [[noun phrase]], adjectives are placed in front of the noun and after the article (if present).\n\n===Inflection===\n\nThe inflection of adjectives follows the gender and number of the following noun. They also inflect for [[definiteness]], like in many other [[Germanic languages]]. When preceded by a definite article, demonstrative determiner, possessive determiner or any other kind of word that acts to distinguish one particular thing from another, the definite form of the adjective is used. In other cases, such as with an indefinite article, indefinite determiner (like ''veel'' \"many\" or ''alle'' \"all\"), the indefinite form is used.\n\nDespite the many different aspects that determine the inflection of an adjective, the adjective only occurs in two main forms. The '''uninflected form''' or '''base form''' is the adjective without any endings. The '''inflected form''' has the ending ''-e''. The inflection of adjectives is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n! Plural\n|-\n! Indefinite\n| een klein'''e''' man\n| een klein'''e''' vrouw\n| een klein huis\n| klein'''e''' mannen, vrouwen, huizen\n|-\n! Definite\n| de klein'''e''' man\n| de klein'''e''' vrouw\n| het klein'''e''' huis\n| de klein'''e''' mannen, vrouwen, huizen\n|}\n\nAdjectives are only inflected in this way when they are in an [[Attributive adjective|attributive]] role, where they precede a noun and modify it. Adjectives in a predicative role, which are used in predicative sentences with a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, are not inflected and always use the uninflected form. Compare:\n\n* ''de klein'''e''' man'' (\"the small man\") &mdash; ''de man is klein'' (\"the man is small\")\n* ''klein'''e''' huizen'' (\"small houses\") &mdash; ''huizen zijn klein'' (\"houses are small\")\n\nMost adjectives ending in ''-en'' have no inflected form. This includes adjectives for materials, as well as the past participles of strong verbs.\n\n* ''de houten stoel'' (\"the wooden chair\")\n* ''het stenen huis'' (\"the brick house\")\n* ''de gebroken lampen'' (\"the broken lamps\")\n\nAdjectives that end in a vowel in their uninflected form are rare, and there are no fixed rules for them. Often, the uninflected and inflected forms are the same, but sometimes an extra ''-\u00eb'' is added on anyway.\n\n====Additional uses of the uninflected form====\n\nUninflected adjectives are occasionally found in other contexts. With neuter nouns, if the adjective is inherently part of the noun as part of a set phrase, then the uninflected form is often used in the definite singular as well:\n\n* ''het openbaar vervoer'' (\"the public transport\", as a specific entity)\n* ''het openbar'''e''' vervoer'' (\"the public transport\", meaning the transport that is public, it could be any transport)\n* ''het groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal'' (\"the big dictionary of the Dutch language\", as a proper title)\n* ''het grot'''e''' woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal'' (\"the big dictionary of the Dutch language\", a dictionary that happens to be big)\n* ''het Burgerlijk Wetboek'' (\"the civil code\", as a proper name)\n\nIndefinite adjectives describing people often remain uninflected, if they express a personal quality. This is not stylistically neutral, but has a formal, rhetorical or poetic ring to it, and can occasionally distinguish literal meanings of an adjective from a more figurative one. Furthermore, this is only done with some nouns, not all.\n\n* ''een talentvol schrijver'' (\"a talented writer\") &mdash; ''een talentvolle schrijver'' (the same)\n* ''een groot man'' (\"a great man\"; figurative meaning) &mdash; ''een grote man'' (\"a big/tall man\"; literal meaning) &mdash; ''een grote vrouw'' (\"a great/big/tall woman\"; ''-e'' is always used with ''vrouw'')\n\n===Partitive===\n\nAdjectives have a special form called the '''partitive''' that is used after an [[indefinite pronoun]] such as ''iets'' \u2018something\u2019, ''niets'' \u2018nothing\u2019, ''veel'' \u2018much, a lot\u2019, ''weinig'' \u2018little, a few\u2019. The partitive form takes the ending ''-s''.\n\n* ''Vertel me iets interessant'''s'''.'' (\"Tell me something interesting.\")\n* ''Ik heb iemand nieuw'''s''' leren kennen.'' (\"I've got to meet somebody new.\")\n\nAdjectives already ending in ''-s'' or ''-sch'' don't take this ending:\n\n* ''Ik heb iets paars aangetrokken.'' (\"I've put on something purple.\") (the base form is already ''paars'')\n* ''Er is niet veel fantastisch aan.'' (\"There isn't much fantastic about it.\")\n\nThe few adjectives that end in a long vowel take instead ''-\u2019s'' with an apostrophe like certain noun plurals.\n\n* ''Ik vond paars niet zo mooi, dus heb ik nu iets lila'''\u2019s'''.'' (\"I didn't like purple so much, so now I have something lilac.\")\n\n===Adjectives used as adverbs===\n\nThe uninflected form of an adjective is implicitly also an adverb. This makes it hard at times to distinguish adjectives and adverbs in Dutch.\n\n* ''Dat is een snell'''e''' auto. De auto rijdt snel.'' (\"That is a fast car. The car drives fast.\")\n* ''Wij werden vriendelijk begroet door die vriendelijk'''e''' mensen.'' (\"We were kindly welcomed by those kind people.\")\n\n===Adjectives used as nouns===\n\nThe inflected form of an adjective can also be used as a noun. Three types can be distinguished:\n\n* The noun that the adjective refers to is omitted but implied. The adjective will then be inflected as if the noun had been present, although the inflected form is normally used even in the indefinite neuter singular.\n** ''Je kunt deze auto kopen in verschillende kleuren. Wil je de '''groene''', de '''blauwe''' of de '''gele'''?'' (\"You can buy this car in various colours. Do you want the green, the blue or the yellow one?\")\n** ''Wij hebben drie kinderen, twee '''grote''' en een '''kleine'''.'' (\"We have three children, two big ones and a small one.\", alternatively ''Wij hebben drie kinderen, twee grote en een klein.'')\n* The adjective is used as a masculine/feminine noun in its own right, usually referring to a person. The ''-e'' will always be added, even to adjectives that already end in ''-en''. The plural is formed with ''-n''.\n** ''Je rijdt als een '''blinde'''!'' (\"You drive like a blind person!\")\n** ''Waar ben je, mijn '''geliefde'''?'' (\"Where are you, my loved one?\")\n** ''Laat de '''gevangene''' vrij!'' (\"Release the prisoner!\", from the past participle ''gevangen'' \"captured, imprisoned\")\n** ''De '''rijken''' moeten de '''armen''' helpen.'' (\"The rich should help the poor.\")\n* The adjective is used as a neuter [[mass noun]] describing a concept.\n** ''Ik kan geen antwoord geven, omdat ik het '''gevraagde''' niet begrijp.'' (\"I can't answer, because I don't understand what was asked.\")\n** ''Angst voor het '''onbekende''' is heel gewoon.'' (\"Fear of the unknown is very normal.\")\n\n===Comparative and superlative===\n\nAdjectives have three degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative. The comparative and superlative are formed synthetically, by adding endings to the adjective. The comparative and superlative can also be formed analytically by using ''meer'' \"more\" and ''meest'' \"most\", but this is much rarer than in English. The analytic forms are used only when the word would become particularly long, or when it would become hard to pronounce (particularly in the superlative).\n\nThe comparative is formed by adding ''-er'' to the base form. For adjectives that end in ''-r'', the comparative is formed by adding ''-der'' to the base form instead. The comparative inflects as an adjective in its own right, having inflected and partitive forms. The uninflected comparative can be used as an adverb as well.\n\n* ''Ik ben groot, maar jij bent grot'''er'''.'' (\"I'm big, but you're bigger.\")\n* ''Dit speelgoed kan gevaarlijk zijn voor klein'''ere''' kinderen. (\"This toy can be dangerous for smaller children.\")\n* ''Deze jas is duur'''der'''.'' (\"This coat is more expensive.\")\n* ''Heb je niets goedkop'''ers'''?'' (\"Do you have nothing cheaper?\")\n* ''Dat heb je nog fantastisch'''er''' gedaan dan de vorige keer!'' (\"You did it even more fantastically than last time!\")\n\nThe superlative is formed by adding ''-st''. This is equivalent to adding ''-t'' to the partitive, and the same rules apply. When an adjective ends in ''-s'' or ''-sch'', this becomes ''-st'' and ''-scht'', but these forms are more rarely used, and the analytic form with ''meest'' is preferred.\n\n* ''De Mont Blanc is de hoog'''ste''' berg van de Alpen.'' (\"Mont Blanc is the highest mountain of the Alps.\")\n* ''Dit is het vies'''te''' toilet dat ik ooit heb gezien.'' (\"This is the dirtiest toilet I've ever seen.\", alternatively ''Dit is het '''meest vieze''' toilet...'')\n\nBecause it is most often used to distinguish one particular thing from all others, the superlative is generally accompanied by a definite article. This means it is rarely found in the uninflected form. Even in predicative sentences, a definite article precedes, so it becomes more like a noun phrase with an implied noun.\n\n* ''Deze jas is de duur'''ste'''.'' (\"This coat is the most expensive.\")\n* ''Dit huis is het groot'''ste'''.'' (\"This house is the biggest.\")\n\nWhen used as an adverb, the superlative is always preceded by the neuter article ''het'', unlike in English where this is optional. Either the uninflected or the inflected form can be used, without any difference in meaning. This form can also be used as part of predicative sentences, which can lead to a mismatch of genders which may seem odd at first glance, but is correct nonetheless:\n\n* ''Deze jas is '''het''' duur'''st'''('''e''').'' (\"This coat is (the) most expensive\")\n* ''Dit huis is '''het''' groot'''st'''('''e''').'' (\"This house is (the) biggest.\")\n* ''Onze auto rijdt '''het''' hard'''st'''('''e''') van allemaal.'' (\"Our car drives (the) fastest of all.\")\n\nNote that the first sentence meaning \"This coat is the most expensive\" has the same meaning as the first sentence further above. They are interchangeable, but they would be parsed differently. With the article ''de'', there is an implied noun, and it might better be translated as \"the most expensive ''one''\". The superlative must also be in the inflected form in this case, ''de duurst'' would be incorrect. With the article ''het'', there is no implied noun, and both the inflected (''het duurste'') and uninflected form (''het duurst'') can be used.\n\nSome comparatives and superlatives are [[Suppletion|suppletive]], and use a different root than the base form. These are irregular.\n\n* ''goed, beter, best'' \u2018good/well, better, best\u2019\n* ''veel, meer, meest'' \u2018much/many, more, most\u2019\n* ''weinig, minder, minst'' \u2018little/few, less/fewer, least/fewest\u2019\n* ''graag, liever, liefst'' \u2018willingly/gladly, rather/more preferably, most preferably\u2019\n* ''dikwijls, vaker, vaakst'' \u2018often, more often, most often\u2019\n\nWhen an adjective is a compound of an adverb and a verb participle, the adverb sometimes changes rather than the whole word. A space may be added as well.\n\n* ''dichtbij, dichterbij, dichtstbij'' \u2018close/nearby, closer, closest\u2019\n* ''dichtbevolkt, dichter bevolkt, dichtstbevolkt'' \u2018densely populated, more densely populated, most densely populated\u2019\n\n==Pronouns and determiners==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pronoun]] -->\n\n===Personal pronouns===\nAs in English, Dutch personal pronouns still retain a distinction in case. Two case forms survive: the subjective on the one hand, and the objective on the other.\n\nLike many other European languages, Dutch has a [[T-V distinction]] in its personal pronouns. The second-person pronouns, which are used to refer to the listener, exist in informal and formal varieties. However, because of the relatively complex and dialect-specific way in which the pronouns developed, this is less straightforward than it is in for example French or German. The [[old Germanic]]/[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] second-person singular pronoun ''du'' / ''doe'' (English ''thou'') fell out of use in Dutch during the [[Middle Ages]], while it remained in use in the closely related [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and in neighboring [[Low German]], [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] and [[German language|German]] languages. The role of the old singular pronoun was taken over by the old plural form, which differed slightly depending on dialect: ''gij'' in the South, ''jij'' in the North. This development also happened in English, which once had a T-V distinction but then lost it when the old informal pronoun ''thou'' was lost. In Dutch, however, further changes occurred, and the North and South developed differently:\n\n* In the North and in the standard language, a new formal pronoun ''u'' was introduced, which made ''jij'' distinctly informal. A new second-person plural pronoun was created by adding ''lie(den)'' \"people\" to the old singular (compare English ''[[y'all]]''). This created ''jullie'', an informal pronoun when speaking to many people. The formal pronoun ''u'' is used for both singular and plural.\n* In many Southern dialects, the older situation remained, and ''gij'' is still a neutral way to speak to a person in those dialects. However, informal ''jij'' and formal ''u'' are commonly used in the standard language of the South, like in the North.\n* Many dialects created their own plural forms of pronouns, such as ''gijlie'' or similar in the South for the second person plural, and also ''hullie'' for the third person plural (\"they\"). These forms are not part of standard Dutch.\n\nMany pronouns can occur in a stressed form and an unstressed (clitic) form. The stressed form retains the original full vowel, and is used when particular emphasis or contrast is needed. The unstressed form normally replaces the vowel with a schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}} and is used in other cases. The unstressed forms are shown in brackets; those spelled with an apostrophe or hyphen are not used often in formal written text.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! [[Grammatical person|person]] !! [[subject (grammar)|subject]] !! [[object (grammar)|object]]\n|-\n| 1st person singular || ik ('k) || mij (me)\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, informal || jij (je) || jou (je)\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, formal || u || u\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, Southern || gij (ge) || u\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, masculine || hij ({{not a typo|-ie}}) || hem ('m)\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, feminine || zij (ze) || haar ('r, d'r)\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, neuter || het ('t) || het ('t)\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| 1st person plural || wij (we) || ons\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, informal || jullie (je) || jullie (je)\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, formal || u || u\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, Southern || gij (ge) || u\n|-\n| 3rd person plural, for a person || zij (ze) || hun, hen (ze)\n|-\n| 3rd person plural, for an object || zij (ze) || die (ze)\n|}\n\nThe pronouns are the only place in the standard language where the difference between masculine and feminine gender is significant. Consequently, the usage of the pronouns differs depending on how many genders are distinguished by a speaker. Speakers in the North will use feminine pronouns for female people, and the masculine pronouns for male people and for common-gender (masculine or feminine) nouns. In the South, the feminine pronouns are used for feminine nouns and the masculine pronouns are used for masculine nouns. See [[Gender in Dutch grammar]] for more details.\n\nThe standard language prescribes that in the third person plural, ''hen'' is to be used for the direct object, and ''hun'' for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms ''hun'' and ''hen'' are interchangeable in normal usage, with ''hun'' being more common. The shared unstressed form ''ze'' is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/hunhen.php |title=''Hun'' of ''hen''? |accessdate=2007-05-23 |work=Onze Taal Taaladviesdienst}}</ref>\n\nIn the North, in informal spoken language, ''hun'' is also used as a subject pronoun by some speakers. This is considered heavily stigmatised and substandard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/hunhebben.php |title=Hun hebben? |accessdate=2007-05-23 |work=Onze Taal Taaladviesdienst}}</ref>\n\n===Possessive determiners===\n\nPossessive determiners also have stressed and unstressed forms, like the pronouns.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! [[Grammatical person|person]] !! uninflected !! inflected\n|-\n| 1st person singular || mijn (m'n) || mijne\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, informal || jouw (je) || jouwe\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, formal || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 2nd person singular, southern || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, masculine || zijn (z'n) || zijne\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, feminine || haar ('r, d'r) || hare\n|-\n| 3rd person singular, neuter || zijn (z'n) || zijne\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| 1st person plural || ons || onze\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, informal || jullie (je) || &mdash;\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, formal || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 2nd person plural, southern || uw || uwe\n|-\n| 3rd person plural || hun || hunne\n|}\n\nPossessive determiners are not inflected when used attributively, unlike adjectives. Thus:\n\n* ''Hij is mijn man.'' (\"He is my husband.\")\n* ''Dat is mijn huis.'' (\"That is my house.\")\n\nAn exception is ''ons'', which inflects like an indefinite adjective, receiving ''-e'' when used with a masculine, feminine or plural noun. Possessive determiners are themselves definite in meaning, so any following adjectives will occur in the definite form even when the possessive itself does not:\n\n* ''ons grot'''e''' huis'' (\"our big house\")\n* ''onz'''e''' grot'''e''' huizen'' (\"our big houses\").\n\nThe inflected form is also used when the determiner is used predicatively. It is always preceded by a definite article in this case, giving the appearance of an implied noun. For example: ''Dit is mijn auto. De auto is de mijn'''e'''.'' (\"This is my car. The car is mine.\", more literally \"The car is the my one\"). ''Jullie'' has no inflected form, the sentence is usually rephrased with ''van'' instead: ''De auto is van jullie.'' (\"The car is of you.\")\n\nBefore the case system was abolished from written Dutch, all possessive determiners inflected as indefinite adjectives, not only ''ons''. They also inflected for case. While this is no longer done in modern Dutch, some relics still remain in fixed expressions. See [[Archaic Dutch declension]] for more details.\n\n===Demonstrative determiners===\nLike English, Dutch has two sets of demonstrative for different degrees of distance. A third, unspecific degree also exists, which is fulfilled by the personal pronouns, but see further below on pronominal adverbs.\n\nThe demonstratives inflect like indefinite adjectives, but irregularly. They are themselves definite in meaning, so any following adjectives will occur in the definite form.\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Proximal demonstrative\n|\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n|-\n! Singular\n| deze\n| deze\n| dit\n|-\n! Plural\n| deze\n| deze\n| deze\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Distal demonstrative\n|\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n|-\n! Singular\n| die\n| die\n| dat\n|-\n! Plural\n| die\n| die\n| die\n|}\n|}\n\nWhen the demonstrative pronoun is used [[exophora|exophorically]] (referring to something that has not yet been mentioned in the text), the \"uninflected\" forms ''dit'' and ''dat'' are always used:\n* '''''Dit''' is mijn nieuwe auto. Ik heb '''deze''' gisteren gekocht.'' (\"This is my new car. I bought this one yesterday.\")\nEven though ''auto'' is of common gender and otherwise requires the form ''deze''. In this sentence, the first pronoun (''dit'') is exophoric, while the second one (''deze'') refers back to ''auto''.\n\nThe exophoric pronoun, when used in a predicative sentence, is always the complement and never the subject. The inflection of the verb follows the other argument instead, and will be plural even when the pronoun is not:\n* ''Dat is een nieuw huis.'' (\"That is a new house\")\n* ''Dit is mijn boek.'' (\"This is my book\")\n* ''Dat zijn nieuwe huizen.'' (\"Those are new houses\", notice singular ''dat'', with plural verb ''zijn'' agreeing with plural noun ''huizen'')\n* ''Dit zijn mijn boeken.'' (\"These are my books\", same with ''dit'')\n\n===Pronominal adverbs===\n{{see also|Pronominal adverb}}\n\nA pronominal adverb is a location adverb that corresponds in meaning to a pronoun, and takes its place. These exist in English as well, but are rare; examples are ''thereby'' (\"by that\"), ''herewith'' (\"with this\") and ''whereupon'' (\"upon what\" or \"upon which\").\n\nPronominal adverbs are used to replace the combination of prepositions with pronouns. They are very common in Dutch, and in some cases mandatory. The following table shows the pronouns that have adverbial forms:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Type\n! Pronoun\n! Adverb\n! Meaning\n|-\n|''personal''\n| hem, haar, het, hun/hen/ze\n| er\n| him, her, it, them, there (unspecific)\n|-\n|''proximal<br>demonstrative''\n| dit\n| hier\n| this, here\n|-\n|''distal<br>demonstrative''\n| dat\n| daar\n| that, there\n|-\n|''interrogative or''<br>''relative''\n| wat, welk, welke\n| waar\n| what, which, where\n|-\n| ''universal''\n| alles\n| overal\n| everything, everywhere\n|-\n|''indefinite''\n| iets\n| ergens\n| something, somewhere\n|-\n|''negative''\n| niets\n| nergens\n| nothing, nowhere\n|}\n\nBoth the combination of preposition+pronoun and the  pronominal adverb can often be used, although the adverbial form is more common. The pronoun is used mainly when one needs to be specific about it. The neuter pronoun ''het'' can never appear as the object of a preposition; the adverbial form is mandatory. Combinations of a preposition and a relative pronoun are also usually replaced by a pronominal adverb. E.g. de combination ''met dewelke'' (with which) is distinctly dated and usually replaced by ''waarmee''.\nThe masculine and feminine pronouns are used more often in the pronoun form, particularly when referring to persons, but the adverbial form may be used occasionally as well. \n\nPronominal adverbs are formed by replacing the pronoun by its corresponding locative adverb and the preposition by its adverbial form and putting them ''in reverse order''. The locative adverbs ''overal'', ''ergens'' and ''nergens'' are separated from the prepositional part by a space, while the other four are joined to it. For example:\n\n* ''Ik reken op je steun.'' (\"I'm counting on your support.\")\n* ''Ik reken '''er'''op.'' (\"I'm counting on it.\")\n* ''Ik reken '''nergens''' op.'' (\"I'm counting on nothing.\", more freely \"I'm not counting on anything.\")\n\nFor most prepositions the adverbial form is ''identical'' with the preposition itself, but there are two exceptions:\n* ''met'' \"with\" \u2192 ''mee''\n** ''Hij stemt '''met''' alle voorstellen in.'' (\"He agrees with all proposals.\")\n** ''Hij stemt er'''mee''' in.'' (\"He agrees with it.\")\n** ''Hij stemt overal '''mee''' in.'' (\"He agrees with everything.\")\n* ''tot'' \"(up) to\" \u2192 ''toe''\n** ''Ik kan me niet brengen '''tot''' deze wandaden.'' (\"I can't bring myself to (commit) these atrocities.\")\n** ''Ik kan me hier'''toe''' niet brengen.'' (\"I can't bring myself to this.\")\n\nThere are prepositions like ''sinds'', ''via'', ''vanwege'' that do not possess an adverbial form, which makes it difficult to use them in a relative construction, because the relative pronouns like ''dewelke'', ''hetwelk'' are becoming obsolete.\n\nConversely, there are a number of prepositional adverbs like ''heen'' or ''af'' that cannot be used as prepositions, but they occur regularly as part of a pronominal adverb or of a separable verb.\n\nThe adverbial pronoun and the prepositional adverb can be separated from each other, with the prepositional part placed at the end of the clause. This is not always required, however, and some situations allow them to remain together.\n\n* '''''Daar''' reken ik '''op'''.'' (\"That, I am counting on.\"), they can be combined too: '''''Daarop''' reken ik.'' or ''Ik reken '''daarop'''.''\n* ''Ik reken '''er''' niet '''op'''.'' (\"I am not counting on it.\"), here they must be separated.\n\nNotice that in Dutch the last word ''op'' is generally analyzed as an ''adverb'', not a preposition. Thus, the often quoted 'rule' that a sentence should not end in a preposition is strictly adhered to.\n\n==Verbs==\n\nDutch verbs inflect for person and number, and for two [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and three [[Grammatical mood|moods]]. However, there is considerable [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] among the forms. In modern usage only the present singular indicative has different forms for different persons, all other number, tense and mood combinations have just one form for all persons.\n\nDutch verbs inflect in these two main tenses:\n* The '''[[present tense]]''' is used to indicate present or future time, and may therefore be considered a \"non-past\" tense. It can express actions that are punctual, progressive or habitual.\n* The '''[[past tense]]''' is used to indicate past time. The actions can be progressive or habitual at the time being discussed, as well as punctual in a sequence of retold events. It is not used to indicate completed punctual events that have relevance for the present; instead the (periphrastic) present perfect is used in this role. Contrast Dutch ''ik heb gisteren mijn vriend ontmoet'' with English ''I met my friend yesterday'' &mdash; the time being discussed is past, but it is considered relevant in the present moment.\n\nVerbs also inflect for the following moods:\n* The '''[[indicative mood]]''' is the default mood of Dutch and is used for general statements.\n* The '''[[subjunctive mood]]''' is used for statements that are perceived as hypothetical or desired. Due to syncretism it is only clearly distinguished from the indicative in the present singular. It is only slightly productive in modern Dutch, and is mainly restricted to formulaic phrases otherwise, such as ''leve de koning'' \"long live the king\" or ''mogen zij in vrede rusten'' \"may they rest in peace\". Usually, it is replaced by the indicative or by a periphrastic conditional phrase.\n* The '''[[imperative mood]]''' is used for commands. It exists only for the second person; imperatives for other persons are expressed periphrastically (''laten we...'' \"let's...\"). Only one form is used for both the singular and plural imperative in modern Dutch. The older separate plural imperative form has fallen out of use and is now archaic or overly formal in tone.\n\nOther grammatical categories such as [[future tense]], [[passive voice]], [[progressive aspect|progressive]] or [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect aspect]] may be expressed periphrastically. Verbs additionally have an infinitive and two participles (present and past).\n\n===Conjugation===\n{{main|Dutch conjugation}}\n\nDutch conjugation resembles that of other continental West Germanic languages such as (Standard) German and Low German, and also the other Germanic languages to a lesser degree. Dutch retains the two main types of verb inherited from [[Proto-Germanic]]: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]]. [[Preterite-present verb]]s are also present, but can be considered irregular. All regular verbs conjugate the same in the present tense (including the infinitive and present participle), so the weak versus strong distinction only matters for the past tense.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the endings:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Infinitive\n| colspan=\"3\" | -en\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Indicative mood\n|-\n|\n! Present\n! Weak past\n! Strong past\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n| -\n| -de, -te\n| -\n|-\n! 2nd sing. ''jij''\n| -(t)\n| -de, -te\n| -\n|-\n! 2nd sg+pl ''gij''\n| -t\n| -de(t), -te(t)\n| -t\n|-\n! 2nd sg+pl ''u''\n| -t\n| -de, -te\n| -\n|-\n! 3rd sing.\n| -t\n| -de, -te\n| -\n|-\n! Plural\n| -en\n| -den, -ten\n| -en\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Subjunctive mood\n|-\n|\n! Present\n! Weak past\n! Strong past\n|-\n! Singular\n| -e\n| -de, -te\n| -e\n|-\n! Plural\n| -en\n| -den, -ten\n| -en\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Imperative mood\n|-\n! General\n| colspan=\"3\" | - \n|-\n! Plural\n| colspan=\"3\" | -t\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Participles\n|-\n|\n! Present\n! Weak past\n! Strong past\n|-\n!\n| -end\n| ge- -d, ge- -t\n| ge- -en\n|}\n\nWeak verbs are the most common type of verb in Dutch, and the only productive type (all newly created verbs are weak). They form their past tense with an ending containing a [[dental consonant]], ''-d-'' or ''-t-''. Which of the two is used depends on the final consonant of the verb stem. If the stem ends in a [[voiceless]] consonant, then ''-t-'' is used, otherwise ''-d-''. It is often summarised with the [[mnemonic]] \"[['t kofschip]]\": if the verb stem ends with one of the consonants of ''[['t kofschip]]'' (''t, k, f, s, ch, p''), then the past tense will have ''-t-''. However, it also applies for ''c'', ''q'' and ''x'' and any other letter that is voiceless in pronunciation.\n\n* ''wer'''k'''en, wer'''kt'''e'' (\"to work, worked\")\n* ''le'''r'''en, lee'''rd'''e'' (\"to learn/teach, learned/taught\")\n* ''ra'''z'''en, raa'''sd'''e'' (\"to rage, raged\")\n* ''los'''s'''en, lo'''st'''e'' (\"to lose/get rid of, lost\")\n\nStrong verbs are less common in Dutch, but they include many of the most common verbs. They form their past tenses by changing the vowel of the stem ([[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]). For strong verbs one needs to learn three or four [[principal parts]]: the infinitive, the past (singular), optionally the past plural, and the past participle. However, the vowel patterns are often predictable and can be divided into seven or so classes, based on the vowels used in these three principal parts. Some verbs are a mixture of two classes.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''rijden, reed, gereden'' (\"ride, rode, ridden\", class 1)\n* ''binden, bond, gebonden'' (\"bind, bound, bound\", class 3a)\n* ''geven, gaf, gegeven'' (\"give, gave, given\", class 5)\n* ''lopen, liep, gelopen'' (\"walk/run, walked, walked\", class 7b)\n\nA number of verbs mix the strong and weak types of past. They have a strong past participle but all the other past tense forms are weak, or the other way around.\n\n* ''lachen, lachte, gelachen'' (\"laugh, laughed, laughed\", weak past, strong past participle)\n* ''zouten, zoutte, gezouten'' (\"salt, salted, salted\", weak past, strong past participle)\n* ''vragen, vroeg, gevraagd'' (\"ask, asked, asked\", strong past, weak past participle)\n\nSome of the most used verbs in the Dutch language have irregular conjugations which don't follow the normal rules. This includes especially the preterite-present verbs. These verbs historically had present tense forms that resembled the past tenses of strong verbs, and can be recognised in modern Dutch by the absence of the ''-t'' in the third-person singular present (the English equivalents lack the ''-s'' in the same way). Preterite-present verbs have weak past tenses, but often irregularly formed. Many of these verbs are now used as auxiliary verbs.\n\nThe additional ''-t'' of the second-person ''gij''-form is optional in the past tense for weak verbs and is usually considered archaic. For strong verbs, the -t is always required.<ref>http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/343/gij_had_hadt/</ref><ref>http://www.vrt.be/taal/gij</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://taalhelden.org/bericht/kwaamt-en-werdt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230235057/http://taalhelden.org/bericht/kwaamt-en-werdt |archive-date=2015-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Non-finite forms===\n\nDutch possesses present and past [[participle]]s.\n\n====Present participle====\n\nThe present participle is always progressive in meaning, and indicates that something is performing the action as the subject. It is usually used as an attributive adjective, and inflects as such as well.\n\n* ''Ik heb een '''vallende''' ster gezien.'' (\"I saw a '''falling''' star.\")\n* '''''Blaffende''' honden bijten niet.'' (\"'''Barking''' dogs don't bite.\")\n* ''Het nieuws verspreidt zich als een '''lopend''' vuurtje.'' (\"The news spreads like wildfire.\" &mdash; literally \"like a '''running''' fire\")\n\nIt can also be used as an adverb, meaning \"while ...ing\". Either the uninflected or inflected form can be used, although the uninflected form is more common outside set phrases.\n\n* ''Al '''doende''' leert men.'' (\"One learns '''while doing'''.\")\n* ''Dit werk is zo makkelijk, ik word '''slapend''' rijk.'' (\"This work is so easy, I'm getting rich '''while sleeping'''.\")\n* '''''Huilend''' vertelde de jongen wat er die dag gebeurd was.'' (\"'''Crying''', the boy told what had happened that day.\")\n\nRarely, the present participle is used as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], to indicate progressive actions as in English, such as ''De bal was '''rollende'''.'' (\"The ball was '''rolling'''.\"). This is usually associated with a stilted or overly formal style. It is more usual to use ''aan het'' plus the infinitive.\n\nThe present participle of a transitive verb can be preceded by an object or an adverb. Often, the space between the two words is replaced with a hyphen or removed altogether, creating a compound adjective.\n* ''Ik zat vast in '''langzaam rijdend''' verkeer.'' (\"I was stuck in '''slow-moving''' traffic.\")\n* ''Het hondje slaakte een '''hartverscheurende''' kreet.'' (\"The little dog let out a '''heart-rending''' cry.\")\n* '''''Stenengooiende''' jongeren zijn een steeds ernstiger probleem.'' (\"'''Rock-throwing''' youths are an increasingly severe problem.\")\n\n====Past participle====\n\nThe past participle indicates completed actions. It is also used to form the [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and the [[Passive voice|passive]] voice with a variety of auxiliary verbs. The formation of these is discussed in the section \"periphrastic forms\".\n\nAs an adjective, the meaning of the past participle can be either active (having performed the action) or passive (having undergone the action), depending on the type of verb:\n\n* For transitive verbs, the meaning is passive. Examples:\n** ''De '''gemaakte''' keuze bleek niet zo geweldig.'' (\"The '''made''' choice (the choice '''that had been made''') turned out to be not so great.\")\n** '''''Gebroken''' glas is gevaarlijk.'' (\"'''Broken''' glass is dangerous.\")\n* For [[unaccusative]] intransitive verbs, the meaning is active. Examples:\n** ''De '''gevallen''' man kon niet meer opstaan.'' (\"The '''fallen''' man could not get back up again.\")\n** ''Iedereen ging op zoek naar het '''verdwenen''' hondje.'' (\"Everyone went looking for the dog '''that had disappeared'''.\")\n* For [[unergative]] intransitive verbs, the past participle cannot be used as an adjective at all. These participles can not be used with a copula such as ''zijn'' (\"to be\") either, but only to form the perfect.\n\nLike present participles, past participles can be preceded by an adverb.\n* '''''Haastig gemaakte''' keuzes leiden later vaak tot problemen.'' (\"'''Hastily-made''' choices often lead to problems later.\")\n* ''Ik heb het liefst '''versgemaakt''' sinaasappelsap.'' (\"I prefer '''freshly-made''' orange juice.\")\n* '''''Jong geleerd''' is '''oud gedaan'''.'' (\"'''Learned young''' is '''done old'''.\", a proverb)\n\n====Infinitive====\n\n=====Verb phrases=====\nThe infinitive can be used in larger verb phrases with an [[auxiliary verb]] or [[modal verb]], much as in English. Like present participles, the infinitive can be accompanied by an object or adverb.\n\n*''Ik kan de auto '''zien'''.'' (\"I can '''see''' the car\")\n\n=====Verbal noun=====\nThe infinitive also doubles as a verbal noun, corresponding to the [[English gerund]] in ''-ing''. The infinitive, when used as a noun, is neuter and has no plural. Dutch also has a feminine gerund in ''-ing'', but this is no longer productive and usually has a concrete, technical meaning, e.g. ''het lenen'' \u2018borrowing, lending\u2019 vs. ''de lening'' \u2018loan\u2019; ''het opleiden'' \u2018educating\u2019 vs. ''opleiding'' \u2018education\u2019. \n\n* ''Het '''doden''' van mensen is verboden.'' - \u2018The killing of people is forbidden\u2019, or less literally \u2018Killing people is forbidden\u2019.\n* ''Ik heb een hekel aan '''wachten'''.'' - \u2018I hate waiting.\u2019\n\nIn the past, the infinitive was inflected for the dative and genitive. There are a few remnants of the latter, e.g. in:\n\n* ''Tot zien'''s'''!'' - \u2018See you!\u2019\n* ''Een uur gaan'''s'''''. - \u2018A distance that can be walked in one hour.\u2019\n\nIt also occurs in expressions involving ''tot ... toe'' (until ... resulted):\n\n* ''Hij werd tot bloeden'''s''' toe geslagen.'' - \u2018He was beaten until bleeding resulted.\u2019\n\n=====Impersonal imperative=====\nThe infinitive is also commonly used as a kind of impersonal or polite imperative (''infinitivus pro imperativo''). This often has a meaning much like the English \u201cone must (not)\u2026\u201d or \u201cplease do (not)\u2026\u201d and can be used to soften a direct command into more of a strong request, or to make the command more general (e.g. on signs and in written instructions) rather than directed at the listener or reader at that specific moment in time. The distinction is not always clear, and often both the infinitive and the imperative may be used without a strong difference in meaning.\n\n* ''Niet '''roken''''' \u2018No smoking\u2019 (or less literally \u2018please refrain from smoking\u2019), versus ''rook niet'' \u2018don't smoke!\u2019.\n* ''Hier '''betalen''''' \u2018Pay here\u2019, alternatively ''betaal hier''.\n* '''''Schudden''' voor gebruik'' \u2018Shake before use\u2019.\n\n=====With ''te''=====\nThe infinitive is often preceded by the preposition ''te'', analogous to the phrase ''to'' + verb in English. It is used in combination with certain verbs like ''beginnen'' \u2018to begin\u2019.\n\n* ''Hij begon '''te hoesten''''' (\"He started '''to cough'''\")\n\nIn combination with ''zijn'' \u2018to be\u2019 it can express a potentiality.\n\n* ''Dat was '''te verwachten'''''  (\"That was '''to be expected'''\").\n\nThe extended form can be used as an adjective:\n\n* ''De '''te verwachten''' menigte'' (\"The crowd '''that is to be expected'''\")\n\nBut it can still carry adverbial expressions or objects:\n\n*''De '''in dat geval te verwachten''' menigte'' (\"The crowd '''that is be expected in that case'''\").\n\nCompound infinitives also exist for the perfect and the future, as well as for the passive voice of transitive verbs, and they can be used to form abridged dependent clauses.\n\n*''Hij beloofde dat '''te zullen betalen'''.'' (\"He promised '''that he would pay''' that\")\n\n===Transitivity===\n\nDepending on meaning and use, Dutch verbs belong to one of a handful of '''transitivity classes''':\n* '''[[Unergative verb|Unergative]]''' [[intransitive verb]]s do not take a [[grammatical object]], and have [[active voice|active]] meaning (the subject is the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]]). The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''hebben''. They possess an impersonal passive voice.\n* '''[[Unaccusative verb|Unaccusative]]''' intransitive verbs do not take a grammatical object, and have [[passive voice|passive]] or [[middle voice|middle]] meaning (the subject is the [[patient]] or there is no clear agent). The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''zijn''.\n* '''[[Transitive verb|Transitive]]''' verbs take a grammatical object. The subject is the agent, the object is either direct (patient) or indirect. The passive voice is formed with the auxiliary ''worden''. The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''hebben'' when the direct object becomes subject, and with the auxiliary ''krijgen'' when the indirect object becomes subject. The perfect passive is formed with ''zijn''.\n* '''[[Ditransitive verb|Ditransitive]]''' verbs take two grammatical objects, a direct object (patient) and an indirect object. These act like transitive verbs in most respects.\n* '''Middle verbs''', also called '''verbs of innocence''', are essentially transitive unaccusative verbs, and take a grammatical object. The perfect is formed with the auxiliary ''zijn'', while the passive is formed with ''worden'' and the perfect passive also with ''zijn''. The use of the perfect auxiliary ''zijn'' carries an implication that the subject is not the direct initiator of the action or cannot or does not want to be held responsible for it. This includes verbs such as ''vergeten'' \"to forget\" and ''verliezen'' \"to lose (an object)\".\n* '''Reflexive verbs''' are accompanied by a reflexive pronoun as object\n* '''Impersonal verbs''' only take an indefinite pronoun ''het'' (it) as subject\n* '''Absolute verbs''' are similar to unergatives, but they lack an impersonal passive form\n\nVerbs can belong to several classes at once, depending on use. Specifically, many transitive verbs can also be used intransitively, and are thus [[ambitransitive]]. For example, ''ik eet een appel'' \"I eat an apple\" contains a transitive verb, while ''ik eet'' \"I eat\" contains an unergative intransitive verb. Most ditransitive verbs can also be used as monotransitives (with only one object, direct or indirect) or even intransitives.\n\nWhether an intransitive use is unergative or unaccusative depends both on the verb and on the meaning in which it is used. Generally, most transitive verbs become unergatives when the object is removed; these are [[accusative verb]]s. But there is also a sizable number of so-called [[ergative verb]]s, which become unaccusative when there is no object. Consequently, these verbs switch from active to either passive or middle meaning when the object is dropped. Examples exist in both Dutch and English, such as the transitive ''ik breek het glas'' \"I break the glass\" versus unaccusative ''het glas breekt'' \"the glass breaks\". In both cases, the glass is the patient, but in the first case it's the direct object while in the second it's the subject. The auxiliary ''zijn'' of such verbs is used for both passive and intransitive use, making those uses essentially indistinguishable. The phrase ''het glas is gebroken'' can be interpreted as both \"the glass has been broken\" and \"the glass is broken\".\n\nAlongside the normal conjugated verb forms, Dutch has a variety of verbal meanings that are expressed using auxiliary verbs or other additional words. The use of auxiliary verbs, particularly of the perfect tenses and the passive voice -if extant-, depends on the transitivity class of the verb.\n\n====Perfect, future and passive====\n\nThe [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] indicates that an action is complete. In Dutch the completion can take place in present, past, present future or past future:\n\n*''Ik heb gegeten'' \u2018I ate\u2019, literally \u2018I have eaten\u2019 \u2013 present perfect (with simple past meaning)\n*''Ik had gegeten'' \u2018I had eaten\u2019 or \u2018I had been eating\u2019 \u2013 past perfect (with pluperfect meaning)\n*''Ik zal gegeten hebben'' \u2018I will have eaten\u2019 \u2013 future perfect\n*''Ik zou gegeten hebben'' \u2018I would have eaten\u2019 \u2013 past conditional (either as [[Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Future-in-the-past|future-in-the-past]] or conditional mood)\n\nThe future tenses all take the auxiliary verb ''zullen'', cognate with English ''shall''.\nThe [[passive voice]] indicates that the subject undergoes the action rather than performing it itself. Both categories are formed with a variety of auxiliary verbs. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Verb type\n! Present\n! Perfect\n! Passive\n! Perfect passive\n|-\n| [[accusative verb|accusative]] transitive<br/>''openen'' \u2018to open\u2019\n| ''Ik '''open''' de doos.''<br/>\u2018I '''am opening''' the box\u2019.\n| '''hebben'''<br/>''Ik '''heb''' de doos '''geopend'''.''<br/>\u2018I '''opened''' the box.\u2019\n| '''worden'''<br/>''De doos '''wordt geopend'''.''<br/>\u2018The box '''is (being) opened'''.\u2019\n| '''zijn'''<br/>''De doos '''is geopend'''.''<br/>\u2018The box '''has been opened'''.\u2019\n|-\n| [[ergative verb|ergative]] transitive<br/>''breken'' \u2018to break\u2019\n| ''Ik '''breek''' het glas.''<br/>\u2018I am breaking the glass\u2019<br/>''Het glas '''breekt'''.''<br/>\u2018The glass '''is breaking / breaks'''.\u2019\n| '''hebben'''<br/>''Ik '''heb''' het glas '''gebroken'''.''<br/>\u2018I '''broke''' the glass.\u2019\n| '''worden'''<br/>''Het glas '''wordt gebroken'''.''<br/>\u2018The glass '''is (being) broken'''.\u2019\n| '''zijn'''<br/>''Het glas '''is gebroken'''.''<br/>\u2018The glass '''has (been) broken'''.\u2019\n|-\n| [[unergative verb|unergative]] intransitive<br/>''blaffen'' \u2018to bark\u2019\n| ''De hond '''blaft'''.''<br/>\u2018The dog '''is barking'''.\u2019\n| '''hebben'''<br/>''De hond '''heeft geblaft'''.''<br/>\u2018The dog '''barked'''.\u2019\n| '''worden'''<br/>''Er '''wordt geblaft''' (door de hond).''<br/>\u2248 \u2018Barking can be heard.\u2019\n| '''zijn'''<br/>''Er '''is geblaft''' (door de hond).''<br/>\u2248 \u2018Barking was heard.\u2019\n|-\n| [[unaccusative verb|unaccusative]] intransitive<br/>''vallen'' \u2018to fall\u2019\n| ''De boom '''valt'''.''<br/>\u2018The tree '''is falling'''\u2019.\n| '''zijn'''<br/>''De boom '''is gevallen'''.''<br/>\u2018The tree '''fell'''.\u2019\n| &mdash;\n| &mdash;\n|}\n\nAs can be seen in the table, in the case of unaccusative verbs, the auxiliary ''hebben'' cannot be used for the perfect, unlike in English. In general these are verbs that describe a process (e.g. to happen, melt, die) rather than an action. That means that there is no (clear) actor involved.\n\nAs in English, ergative verbs can occur both in a transitive (I break the glass) and in an unaccusative mode (the glass breaks). In Dutch the perfect of the latter takes ''zijn'' \u2018to be\u2019, so that ''het glas is gebroken'' can either be seen as a perfect passive or as a perfect unaccusative. Dutch differs from German in that the latter language would add the participle ''worden'' to the passive sentence: ''Das Glas is gebrochen '''worden'''''.\n\nUnergatives in general do possess passive forms, but they are ''impersonal''.  They typically take the adverb ''er'' as a dummy subject and are hard to translate directly into English. ''Er wordt geblaft'' means something like \u2018There\u2019s barking going on\u2019 or \u2018There\u2019s some dog barking\u2019. Impersonal constructions of this kind are quite common in the language. The passives of transitive verbs can also be given an impersonal flavor by adding the dummy adverb ''er'', provided the subject is indefinite, e.g. ''Er worden dozen geopend'' \u2018There are boxes being opened\u2019 or \u2018Boxes are being opened\u2019. \n\nVerbs of motion like ''lopen'' \u2018to walk\u2019, ''zwemmen'' \u2018to swim\u2019, ''rijden'' \u2018to ride, drive\u2019 typically occur as unaccusative / unergative pairs. If the motion is directional it is seen as a ''process'' and the auxiliary is ''zijn''. If the motion is not directional it is seen as an action and the auxiliary verb is ''hebben'', unless the verb is used in the impersonal passive in which case it can take ''worden'' and ''zijn''.\n;directional\n*''Ik loop naar huis'' \u2013 \u2018I am walking home\u2019\n*''Ik '''ben''' naar huis gelopen'' \u2013 \u2018I walked home\u2019\n;non-directional\n*''Ik loop veel'' \u2013 \u2018I walk a lot\u2019\n*''Ik '''heb''' veel gelopen'' \u2013 \u2018I walked a lot\u2019\n*''Er '''wordt''' veel gelopen'' \u2013 \u2018There is a lot of walking going on\u2019\nNote also that the meanings of the formations that use ''zijn'' correspond to the meaning of the past participle when used as an adjective. Thus, unergative verbs can never use ''zijn'' as the auxiliary as their past participles cannot be used as adjectives. Furthermore, for ergative verbs, the passive does not differ significantly in meaning from the regular intransitive present tense. This is also true of English: a glass that ''breaks'' is a glass that ''is (being) broken''.\n\nThe forms listed above can occur in both present and past tense. The table lists the present tense forms, while the past tense is formed by conjugating the auxiliary verb in the past tense. Thus, this creates ''Ik '''had''' de doos '''geopend'''.'' \u2018I '''had opened''' the box.\u2019 and so on.\n\nWhen the perfect is created from a phrase that already uses an auxiliary verb, the auxiliary gets used in the infinitive form, rather than the past participle. Some auxiliary verbs even have no past participle due to this. For example:\n* ''Ik '''zal''' morgen komen.'' \u2018I '''will''' come tomorrow.\u2019 \u2192 ''Ik '''had''' morgen '''zullen''' komen.'' \u2018I '''had been going to''' come tomorrow.\u2019\n* ''Hij '''moet''' de deur sluiten.'' \u2018He '''has to''' close the door.\u2019 \u2192 ''Hij '''heeft''' de deur '''moeten''' sluiten.'' \u2018He '''has had to''' close the door.\u2019\n\n=====Ditransitive verbs=====\nDitransitive verbs carry both a direct and an indirect object. In English both objects can become the subject of a passive construction and the same auxiliary is used to form it:\n\n*I give the man a book\n*The man '''is''' given a book by me\n*A book '''is''' given to the man by me.\n\nIn Dutch a verb like ''schenken'' (to donate) follows a similar pattern but the auxiliary ''krijgen'' (to get) is used for the pseudo-passive construction that renders the indirect object into the subject, whereas ''worden'' is used for passive involving the direct object:\n\n*Ik schenk de man een boek\n*De man '''krijgt''' van mij een boek geschonken\n*Een boek '''wordt''' door mij aan de man geschonken.\n\nThe following three groups of verbs only take the auxiliary ''hebben'' in the perfect tenses\n\n=====Impersonal verbs=====\nImpersonal verbs have no true subject, but use a dummy subject pronoun ''het'' (\"it\"). These verbs often refer to conditions, such as the weather:\n* ''Het regent.'' (\"It rains.\" or \"It is raining.\")\n* ''Het onweert.'' (\"A thunderstorm is happening.\")\n\n=====Reflexive verbs=====\nReflexive verbs take a reflexive pronoun like ''me'', ''je'' or ''zich'' as their (dummy) direct object and take ''hebben'' in the perfect. This contrasts with e.g. French, where \u00eatre (to be) is used as perfect auxiliary.\n\n*Ik vergiste me  (I mistook, made an error)\n*Ik heb me vergist \n\nSome of these occur in pairs with a transitive form, replacing the unaccusative component of an ergative.\n\n*Ratten verbreiden de ziekte \u2013 -(Rats spread the disease)\n*De ziekte verbreidt zich \u2013 (The disease is spreading)\n\nThere are no verbs that ''only'' occur in a reciprocal form, but those that can take the reciprocal pronoun ''elkaar'' (each other) also take ''hebben'' in the perfect, thus behaving like reflexive ones.\n\n*Massa's trekken elkaar aan. - (Masses attract each other.)\n*De magneten hadden elkaar aangetrokken - (The magnets had attracted each other).\n\n=====Absolute verbs=====\nThese verbs resemble the unergative ones, except that they do not possess an impersonal passive.\n\n*De zon schijnt \u2013 (The sun shines)\n* *Er wordt geschenen <- does not exist-->\n\nSome of them may carry a direct object, but they have neither a personal, nor an impersonal passive:\n\n*Een jas aanhebben \u2013 (To wear a coat)\n* *Een jas wordt aangehad <-does not exist->\n\nSimilarly the past participle cannot be used as adjective:\n\n* *De aangehadde jas <-does not exist->\n\n====Future====\n\nAlthough the present tense can be used to indicate future events, there is also a more explicit future tense in Dutch. It is formed using the auxiliary ''zullen'' (\"will, shall, be going to\"), which can be conjugated in both present and past tense. The \"past future\" carries a sense having pledged or promised to do something, or having been expected to do it, much as \"was/were going to\" does in English.\n\n* ''Ik '''zal''' het morgen doen.'' (\"I '''will''' do it tomorrow.\" or \"I '''am going to''' do it tomorrow.\")\n* ''Je '''zou''' gisteren de ramen schoonmaken!'' (\"You '''were going to''' clean the windows yesterday!\")\n\nAn alternative future tense is formed using ''gaan'' (\"to go\") as the auxiliary. It is used in its literal meaning to indicate that one is moving to a place to perform an action, or is intending to do so (\"be going to go\"). More generally, it can indicate any kind of intention or plan to perform the action. It can also imply the start of an action in the future.\n\n* ''Ik '''ga''' morgen met mijn vriendinnen winkelen.'' (\"I'm '''going to go''' shopping with my friends tomorrow.\")\n* ''Voor vandaag is het werk klaar; morgen '''gaan''' ze verder werken.'' (\"For today the work is done; tomorrow they're '''going to''' continue working.\")\n* ''Het '''gaat''' zo hard regenen.'' (\"It's '''going to start''' raining hard in a moment.\")\n\n====Conditional====\n\nThe [[conditional mood]] is formed using the past tense of ''zullen'', which is ''zou'' in the singular and ''zouden'' in the plural. It is therefore somewhat analogous to the use of ''would'' in English, as the past tense of the future auxiliary ''will''. The conditional is identical in form to the \"past future\" described above, but is always accompanied by some kind of condition that the verb depends on, usually introduced with conjunctions like ''als'' (\"if\").\n\n* ''Ik '''zou''' dat niet doen als ik jou was.'' (\"I '''would''' not do that if I were you.\")\n* ''Hij '''zou''' de ramen niet hebben schoongemaakt, als ze niet vies waren.'' (\"He '''would''' not have cleaned the windows, if they were not dirty.\")\n\n====Progressive====\n\nThe [[progressive aspect]] indicates that an action is ongoing and in progress. It is formed using ''zijn'' + ''aan het'' + infinitive of action verb. It is equivalent to the English \u2018be \u2026-ing\u2019 or \u2018be in the middle of \u2026-ing\u2019, but is not used as often.\n\n* ''Je zult even moeten wachten, ik '''ben''' nu '''aan het eten'''.'' \u2018You'll have to wait (a while), I '''am eating''' now.\u2019\n* ''Hij '''was''' de ramen '''aan het schoonmaken''' toen de telefoon ging.'' \u2018He '''was cleaning''' the windows when the phone rang.\u2019\n\nUnlike in English, the progressive cannot be combined with the perfect to make a hypothetical \"perfect progressive\". Both \"I have been eating\" and \"I had been eating\" are expressed using the simple past tense form of the progressive: ''Ik '''was aan het eten'''.''\n\nA similar expression is ''bezig'' + ''zijn te'' + infinitive of action verb or ''bezig zijn met'' + action noun.\n\n* ''Hij '''is bezig''' de klok '''te repareren'''.'' \u2018He\u2019s (busy) repairing the clock\u2019.\n** Or: ''Hij '''is bezig met''' de reparatie van de klok.'' \u2018Idem\u2019.\n* ''Je '''bent''' de hele dag '''bezig met''' dat kind '''te helpen'''.'' \u2018You\u2019re spending the whole day helping that child.\u2019 (notice the superfluous ''met'' which is colloquial).\n\nA different way to render progressive aspect is to use the (static) verbs ''zitten'' \u2018to sit\u2019, ''lopen'' \u2018to walk\u2019, ''staan'' \u2018to stand\u2019 and ''liggen'' \u2018to lie\u2019 with ''te'' + infinitive. These verbs, when in the perfect, all use a double infinitive.\n* ''Ik '''zit te eten'''.''  - \u2018I\u2019m sat down eating\u2019 (UK) or \u2018I\u2019m sitting here eating\u2019 (North America).\n* ''Ik '''sta''' de ramen '''schoon te maken'''.'' - \u2018I\u2019m stood (here) cleaning windows\u2019 (UK) or \u2018I\u2019m standing here cleaning windows\u2019 (North America).\n* ''Jantje '''ligt te slapen'''.''  - \u2018Jantje is sleeping\u2019.\n\nThe literal meaning of the verbs ''to sit'' or ''to stand'' etc. is often secondary to their durative aspect.\n\n==Numerals==\nDutch uses a [[decimal]] numeral system. Numerals are not inflected.\n\n===0-9===\nThe numbers from 0 to 9 are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9\n|-\n| nul || een || twee || drie || vier || vijf || zes || zeven || acht || negen\n|}\n\nNote that ''een'' is the same word as the indefinite article in the written language. When confusion is possible, the number is often written as ''\u00e9\u00e9n'' to distinguish it from the article. The pronunciation differentiates them in speech: the article is {{IPA|/\u0259n/}}, the numeral is {{IPA|/e\u02d0n/}}.\n\n===10-19===\n\nThe numbers 10, 11 and 12 are irregular. 13 to 19 are formed by adding ''-tien'' (\"-teen\") to the base number. Two are slightly irregular: 13 is ''d'''er'''tien'' with [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] (compare English ''th'''ir'''teen''), and 14 is ''v'''ee'''rtien''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 10 !! 11 !! 12 !! 13 !! 14 !! 15 !! 16 !! 17 !! 18 !! 19\n|-\n| tien || elf || twaalf || dertien || veertien || vijftien || zestien || zeventien || achttien || negentien\n|}\n\n===20-99===\n\nThe decades 20 to 90 are formed by adding ''-tig'' (\"-ty\") to the base number. However, some are slightly irregular: 20 is ''tw'''in'''tig'', 30 and 40 are ''d'''er'''tig'' and ''v'''eer'''tig'' (comparable to 13 and 14 above), 80 is '''''t'''achtig''. The remaining decades, although spelled beginning with ''v'' and ''z'', are often pronounced beginning with voiceless {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} even in dialects that do not devoice these consonants normally.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 10 !! 20 !! 30 !! 40 !! 50 !! 60 !! 70 !! 80 !! 90\n|-\n| tien || twintig || dertig || veertig || vijftig || zestig || zeventig || tachtig || negentig\n|}\n\nCombinations of a decade and a unit are constructed in a regular way: the unit comes first, followed by ''en'' (\"and\"), followed by the decade. No spaces are written between them, and a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] is added when necessary. For example:\n\n* 28 ''achtentwintig'' (\"eight and twenty\")\n* 83 ''drie\u00ebntachtig'' (\"three and eighty\")\n* 99 ''negenennegentig'' (\"nine and ninety\")\n\n===Hundreds===\n\n100 is ''honderd''. Multiples of 100 are expressed by placing the multiple before ''honderd'', without any spaces: 200 ''tweehonderd'', 300 ''driehonderd'' and so on. Sometimes multiples higher than 10 can be used as synonyms for the thousands, such as 1100 ''elfhonderd'', 2500 ''vijfentwintighonderd''.\n\nCombinations of a hundred and a lower number are expressed by just placing them together, with the hundred coming first. Sometimes, ''en'' is added in between, but this is optional and not commonly done nowadays.\n\n* 112 ''honderdtwaalf'' or ''honderdentwaalf''\n* 698 ''zeshonderdachtennegentig''\n* 1258 ''twaalfhonderdachtenvijftig''\n\n===Thousands===\n\n1000 is ''duizend''. Unlike in English, this is not preceded by an article. The same system used for naming the hundreds applies to the thousands as well, so multiples of 1000 are expressed by writing the multiple right before: 2000 ''tweeduizend'', 3000 ''drieduizend'', 20000 ''twintigduizend'', 999000 ''negenhonderdnegenennegentigduizend''.\n\nCombinations of a thousand and a lower number are expressed by placing them together, with the thousand coming first. A space is written between them.\n\n* 1 258 ''duizend tweehonderdachtenvijftig''\n* 9 001 ''negenduizend een''\n* 32 348 ''twee\u00ebndertigduizend driehonderdachtenveertig''\n* 123 456 ''honderddrie\u00ebntwintigduizend vierhonderdzesenvijftig''\n\n===Millions and above===\n\nDutch always uses the [[long and short scales|long scale system]].\n\n* 1 000 000 ''[[1000000 (number)|miljoen]]''\n* 1 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000 (number)|miljard]]''\n* 1 000 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000000 (number)|biljoen]]''\n* 1 000 000 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000000000 (number)|biljard]]''\n* etc.\n\nMultiples of any of these are similar to the thousands, but a space is written between the multiple and the \"million\": 2 000 000 ''twee miljoen'', 420 000 000 000 ''vierhonderdtwintig miljard''. If the multiple is 1, it must also be present, unlike with the thousands where it is left out: 1 000 000 ''een miljoen''.\n\nCombinations with lower numbers are much the same as with the thousands.\n\n* 117 401 067 ''honderdzeventien miljoen vierhonderdeenduizend zevenenzestig''\n* 10 987 654 321 ''tien miljard negenhonderdzevenentachtig miljoen zeshonderdvierenvijftigduizend driehonderdeenentwintig''\n\n===Ordinal numbers===\n\nOrdinal numbers behave and inflect like superlative adjectives. They always appear in the inflected form, always ending in ''-e'', and are usually preceded by a definite article of some kind.\n\nThe ordinal adjectives are formed by adding either ''-de'' or ''-ste'' to the base number. Which one is added depends on the word. The numbers 1 and 3 have irregular ordinals.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 1st !! 2nd !! 3rd !! 4th !! 5th !! 6th !! 7th !! 8th !! 9th\n|-\n| eer'''st'''e || twee'''d'''e || der'''d'''e || vier'''d'''e || vijf'''d'''e || zes'''d'''e || zeven'''d'''e || acht'''st'''e || negen'''d'''e\n|-\n! 10th !! 11th !! 12th !! 13-19th !! 20-90th !! 100th !! 1 000th !! 1 000 000th+ !! 1 000 000 000th+\n|-\n| tien'''d'''e || elf'''d'''e || twaalf'''d'''e || -tien'''d'''e || -tig'''st'''e || honderd'''st'''e || duizend'''st'''e || -joen'''st'''e || -jard'''st'''e\n|}\n\nWhen a number is composed of multiple parts, the ending is added only to the last part of the word, and follows the rules for that word. Thus, 21st ''eenentwintig'''st'''e'', 409th ''vierhonderdnegen'''d'''e'', 9001st ''negenduizend eer'''st'''e''.\n\n===Fractional numbers===\n\nFractional numbers are expressed using a cardinal number for the numerator, and an ordinal for the denominator, like in English.\n* 1/5 ''een vijfde''\n* 3/8 ''drie achtste''\n1/2 and 1/4 are ''een half'' (\"a half\") and ''een kwart'' (\"a quarter\") respectively, although the regular ''een tweede'' and ''een vierde'' are also possible, but rarer. In 3/4, the space is often left out: ''driekwart''.\n\nWhen combined with a full cardinal, the full cardinal comes first and they are separated by ''en'' and spaces. The word ''en'' can be left out if the numerator is not 1.\n* 9 3/4 ''negen (en) driekwart''\n* 5 1/6 ''vijf en een zesde''\n* 3 1/2 ''drie en een half''\nThe combination 1 1/2 is usually expressed irregularly as ''anderhalf'', which literally means \"other half\" (''ander'' was originally a synonym of ''tweede'', and this combination meant \"second, minus a half\").\n\n===Iterative numbers===\n\nThese express repetition, like \"once\" or \"five times\". They are formed with a cardinal number followed by ''maal'' or ''keer'' (both meaning \"times\").\n* ''twee maal/keer'' (\"two times, twice\")\n* ''negen maal/keer'' (\"nine times\")\n* ''honderd maal/keer'' (\"a hundred times\")\nThe space is often left out for the combinations ''eenmaal'' (\"once\"), ''tweemaal'' (\"twice\") and ''driemaal'' (\"thrice\"), but not with ''keer''.\n\nThere are also ordinal forms of these, which express an iteration within a sequence of repetitions. They are formed with an ordinal instead of a cardinal, and act as masculine nouns.\n* ''de eerste keer/maal'' (\"the first time\")\n* ''de dertigste keer/maal'' (\"the thirtieth time\")\n\n===Multiplicative numbers===\n\nThese express a multiple of something. They are formed with the suffix ''-voud'' \u2018-fold\u2019 and are neuter nouns.\n* ''tweevoud'' \u2018a twofold, multiple of two\u2019\n* ''drievoud'' \u2018a threefold, multiple of three\u2019\n* ''honderdvoud'' \u2018a hundredfold, multiple of hundred\u2019\nFor the number 1, ''enkelvoud'' \u2018singular(ity), a onefold\u2019 is used, which is derived from ''enkel'' \u2018single\u2019 rather than ''een''. The \"regular\" form ''eenvoud'' instead means \u2018simpleness, uncomplicatedness, ease\u2019.\n\nAdjectives are formed by adding ''-ig'' to this, giving the combination ''-voudig''.\n* ''tweevoudig'' \u2018double, twofold\u2019\n* ''drievoudig'' \u2018triple, threefold\u2019\n* ''honderdvoudig'' \u2018hundredfold\u2019\nAgain, ''enkelvoudig'' \u2018single, simple, onefold\u2019 is used for 1, and ''eenvoudig'' means \u2018simple, uncomplicated, easy\u2019. Alternatively, the word ''enkel'' \u2018single\u2019 can be used alone. A synonym for ''tweevoudig'' is ''dubbel''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dutch declension]]\n*[[Dutch conjugation]]\n*[[DT-Manie]]\n\n== References ==\n*Aarts, Florent G.A.M. & Herman Wekker.
