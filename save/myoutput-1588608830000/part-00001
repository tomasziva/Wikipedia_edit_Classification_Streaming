The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sand\u017eak]] region cutting into present-day [[\u0160umadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kuk\u00ebs]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western North Macedonia with the city of [[Skopje]] (then \u00dcsk\u00fcp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day North Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as [[\u0160tip]] (''\u0130\u015ftip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova'').

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts ([[oblast]]) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Ra\u0161ka and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. In order to change the [[Demographics of Kosovo|ethnic composition of Kosovo]], between 1912 and 1941 a [[Colonisation of Kosovo|large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo]] was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.<ref name = \"Schabnel 2001 20\"/>\n\nAlbanians and other [[Muslims]] were forced to emigrate, mainly with the land reform which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.<ref name=\"daskalovski\">Daskalovski, \u017didas.

In the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a vilayet with its borders having been revised on several occasions.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganised as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.\n\n[[File:Odissea Bekim Fehmiu.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bekim Fehmiu]] was the first Eastern European actor to star in [[Hollywood]] during the Cold War.]]\n\nThe International [[Dokufest|Documentary and Short Film Festival]] is the largest film event in Kosovo. The Festival is organised in August in [[Prizren]] , which attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organised festival, films are screened twice a day in three open-air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas. Except for its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which altogether turn the city into a charming place to be. In 2010, Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.<ref>[http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 Dokufest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820055759/http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 |date=20 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nInternational actors of [[Albanians in kosovo|Albanian origin]] from Kosovo include [[Arta Dobroshi]], [[James Biberi]], [[Faruk Begolli]] and [[Bekim Fehmiu]].

During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sand\u017eak]] region cutting into present-day [[\u0160umadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kuk\u00ebs]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western North Macedonia with the city of [[Skopje]] (then \u00dcsk\u00fcp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day North Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as [[\u0160tip]] (''\u0130\u015ftip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova''). According to some historians, Serbs likely formed a majority of Kosovo from the 8th to the mid-19th century.{{sfn|Banac|p=42}}<ref>''The Balkans: A Post-Communist History'', I Jeffries, R Bideleux 2007, p. 513</ref> Nevertheless, this claim is difficult to prove, as historians who base their works on Ottoman sources of the time give solid evidence that at least the western and central parts of Kosovo had an Albanian majority. The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian. Central Kosovo, as well as the cities of Prizren, Gjakova, and the region of [[Has (region)|Has]] regularly supplied the Ottoman forces with levies and mercenaries. <ref name=\"Anscombe\">Anscombe, Frederick F.

Evidence of depopulation can only be found in areas between [[Ni\u0161]] and Belgrade.

The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organised along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania (from Kruje to the \u0160ar range).<ref>Fine (1994), p. 51: \"The Albanians were not to create any structure resembling a state until the fifteenth century.

In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. After the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbia was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] on 1 December 1918.\n\nKosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia ([[Zve\u010dan]], Kosovo and southern [[Metohija]]) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts ([[oblast]]) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Ra\u0161ka and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. In order to change the [[Demographics of Kosovo|ethnic composition of Kosovo]], between 1912 and 1941 a [[Colonisation of Kosovo|large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo]] was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.<ref name = \"Schabnel 2001 20\"/>\n\nAlbanians and other [[Muslims]] were forced to emigrate, mainly with the land reform which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.<ref name=\"daskalovski\">Daskalovski, \u017didas.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganised as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.\n\n[[File:Odissea Bekim Fehmiu.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bekim Fehmiu]] was the first Eastern European actor to star in [[Hollywood]] during the Cold War.]]\n\nThe International [[Dokufest|Documentary and Short Film Festival]] is the largest film event in Kosovo.
