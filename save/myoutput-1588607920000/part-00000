Since 1945 it has been held on the last Wednesday of August, during a week of festivities in Bu\u00f1ol.\n\n==History==\n[[File:La Tomatina (25.08.2010) - Spain, Bu\u00f1ol 21.jpg|thumb|left|La Tomatina 25-08-2010.]]\n[[File:Tomatina_2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tomato battle at Tomatina in 2006.]]\n\nThe La Tomatina Festival started the last Wednesday of August in 1945 when some young people spent the time in the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young boys decided to take part in a parade with musicians, Giants and Big-Heads figures. The energy of jovialities caused one participant's Big-head to fall off. The participant flew into a fit of rage, began hitting everything in his path. There was a market stall of vegetable that fell victim to the fury of the crowd. People started to pelt each other with tomatoes until the local forces ended that fruit battle.\n\nThe following year, some young people engaged in a pre-planned quarrel and brought their own tomatoes from home. Although the police broke it up, this began the yearly tradition. In the following years, the young boys' example had unwittingly made history.\n\nLa Tomatina was banned in the early 50s, however this did not stop the participants who were arrested. But the people protested the prohibition and the festivity was again allowed with more participants and increased passions. The festivity was again cancelled till 1957 when, as a sign of protest, the tomato burial was held. It was a demonstration in which the residents carried a coffin with a huge tomato inside. The parade was accompanied by a music band which played funeral marches. The protest was successful. La Tomatina Festival was finally permitted and became an official festival.\n\nAs a result of the report of Javier Basilio,  a broadcaster from the Spanish television program called ''Informe Semanal'', the festivity started to be known throughout the rest of Spain. Since then, the number of participants increased year after year as well as the excitement about La Tomatina Festival. In 2002, La Tomatina of Bu\u00f1ol was declared Festivity of International Tourist Interest by the Secretary Department of Tourism due to its success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latomatina.info/en/la-tomatina/|title=La Tomatina \u2013 P\u00e1gina oficial|last=Studio|first=Socarrat|website=latomatina.info|language=es|access-date=2017-08-20}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Two men preparing greasy pole for La Tomatina festival.jpg|right|thumb|Preparing the \"palo jab\u00f3n\"]]\n\nUsually, the fight lasts for about one hour, after which the town square is covered with tomato debris.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/travel/features/2009/0626/141194-latomatina/ | title=La Tomatina | journal=RT\u00c9 News | publisher=RTE | author=Mullins, Deirdre| date=2009-06-26 }}</ref> Fire trucks then hose down the streets and participants often use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomatoes from their bodies.
