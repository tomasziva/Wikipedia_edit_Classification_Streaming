The two are nursing severe injuries which, they reveal, were inflicted as they escaped the violent human destruction of Sandleford, and then later at Cowslip's warren.

With the help of their useful new friend, a [[black-headed gull]] named Kehaar, they locate a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded and has many does.

Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but only one of the bucks, and at the expense of badly injuring Hazel's hind-leg. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a [[police state]] led by the [[despotism|despotic]] General Woundwort.

Through Bigwig's bravery and loyalty, and Hazel's ingenuity, the Watership Down rabbits seal the fate of the Efrafan general by unleashing the Nuthanger Farm watchdog. As the Efrafans flee in terror, Woundwort, despite being greatly wounded in his battle with Bigwig, refuses to back down and leaps at the dog.

Though Hazel is not particularly large or powerful, he is loyal, brave and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.\n*'''Fiver:''' A [[runt]] rabbit whose name literally means \"Little Thousand\" (rabbits have a single word, \"hrair\", for all numbers greater than four; Fiver's name in Lapine, ''Hrairoo'', indicates that he is the smallest of a litter of five or more rabbits)<ref>{{cite book |last= Adams |first= Richard |title= Watership Down |location= New York |publisher= Scribner |edition= 1st Scribner trade paperback |year= 2005 |page= 5 |isbn=0-7432-7770-8 |quote= There were probably more than five rabbits in the litter when Fiver was born, but his name, ''Hrairoo'', means \"Little Thousand\"{{snd}} i.e. the little one of a lot or, as they say of pigs, the \"runt.\"}}</ref> and Hazel's younger brother. As a seer, he has visions and strong instincts. Fiver is one of the most intelligent rabbits in the group. He is shy, quiet, kind and intuitive with common sense, and though he does not directly act as a leader, the others listen to and follow his advice. Vilthuril becomes his mate.\n*'''Bigwig:''' An ex-Owsla officer, and the largest and bravest rabbit of the group. His name in Lapine is ''Thlayli'', which literally means \"Fur-head\" and refers to the shock of fur on the back of his head. Though he is powerful and fierce, he is also shown to be cunning in his own way when he devises a plan to defeat the larger and stronger General Woundwort. His final battle with Woundwort leaves him severely wounded, but he survives and becomes the leader of Hazel's Owsla.\n*'''Blackberry:''' A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He is often capable of understanding concepts the other rabbits find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.\n*'''Holly:''' Former captain of the Sandleford Warren Owsla, escapes with Bluebell when his warren is destroyed by men. He is near death when he finds the warren at Watership Down, but is nursed back to health and becomes one of Hazel's most trusted companions.\n*'''Bluebell:''' Buck rabbit who escapes with Holly during the destruction of Sandleford and tells jokes to cope and help Holly recover from the mental strain of seeing the Sandleford warren destroyed. He will often jokingly speak in rhyme.\n*'''Strawberry:''' Buck from Cowslip's warren who leaves with the Watership Down rabbits after his doe is killed by a snare. Strawberry is strong and sleek but not as hardy as the other rabbits given his warren upbringing but learns quickly and gets along well with the group. It is for this reason that he is selected to represent the rabbits on an expedition to Efrafa.\n*'''Haystack:''' One of the hutch rabbits who escapes in order to live with the wild rabbits.\n*'''Buckthorn:''' A strong buck who was expected to be part of the Sandleford Owsla once he reached maturity.\n*'''Hawkbit:''' Described in the book as a \"rather stupid rabbit\" but is accepted by Hazel regardless.\n*'''Dandelion:''' A buck rabbit notable for his storytelling ability and speed. He is instrumental in luring the Nuthanger Farm dog into the Efrafans during the siege of Watership Down.\n*'''Silver:''' A strong buck rabbit, given his name for his silver-grey fur, he fights alongside Bigwig and helps defend the rabbits during their journey. He is teased for his silver fur at the Sandleford warren which is one of the reasons he was more willing to leave.\n*'''Pipkin:''' A small and timid buck rabbit, who looks to Hazel as big brother, guidance and protection. Hazel encourages him, and Pipkin grows loyal to Hazel. He proves to be a constant comforter, particularly for Holly after the destruction of Sandleford warren. His name is Hlao-roo in Lapine.\n*'''Hyzenthlay:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa and assists Bigwig in arranging for the liberation of its inhabitants. General Woundwort, who suspects her of fomenting dissension, orders his guards to keep a close eye on her. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig. Like Fiver, she has visions. Her name means literally \"shine-dew-fur\", or \"fur shining like dew\".\n*'''Vilthuril:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa. Similar to Fiver and Hyzenthlay, it is understood that she has visions and is a seer. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig, Hyzenthlay and the other does. She becomes Fiver's mate and is said to be the only one to understand him as well as Hazel.\n*'''Blackavar:''' A rabbit with dark fur who tries to escape from Efrafa but is apprehended, mutilated, and put on display to discourage further escape attempts. When he is liberated by Bigwig, he quickly proves himself an expert tracker and ranger, and also shows himself to be an effective fighter when the Efrafan rabbits attack the warren. [[File:Chroicocephalus ridibundus (summer).jpg|thumb|right|Kehaar is a [[black-headed gull]] (''Chroicocephalus ridibundus''; pictured with summer plumage)]]\n*'''Kehaar:''' A [[black-headed gull]] who is forced, by an injured wing, to take refuge on Watership Down, and befriends the rabbits when they help him. He is characterised by his frequent impatience, guttural accent and unusual phrasing. After discovering the Efrafa warren and helping the rabbits, he rejoins his colony, but promises to visit. According to Adams, Kehaar was based on a fighter from the [[Norwegian Resistance]] in [[World War II]].<ref name= \"Intro\">Adams, Richard. \"Introduction.\" ''Watership Down'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] U.S. edition, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-7770-8}}.</ref>\n*'''The Mouse:''' Never named, the mouse is a resident of Watership Down before the arrival of the rabbits. While rabbits usually despise mice and other rodents, who tend to be liars and untrustworthy according to Bigwig, Hazel kindly saves the mouse from a [[kestrel]]. This action allies the mice and rabbits on Watership Down, and the same mouse later warns them of General Woundwort's intended surprise attack, thus saving many lives.\n*'''General Woundwort:''' The main [[antagonist]] of the novel, a fearless, cunning and brutally efficient rabbit who was orphaned at a young age, Woundwort founded the Efrafa warren and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks mercy and kindness. He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren as an act of revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery. After his apparent death fighting the Nuthanger farm dog, he lives on in rabbit legend as a [[bogeyman]].\n*'''Captain Campion:''' Woundwort's most trusted subordinate, Campion is a loyal, brave and clever officer. After Woundwort disappears, he becomes the Chief Rabbit of Efrafa and reforms it, making peace with the Watership rabbits.\n*'''Vervain:''' The head of the Council police in Efrafa, said to be one of the most hated rabbits in the warren. When Woundwort's forces storm the Honeycomb, he is ordered by Woundwort to kill Fiver, but Fiver's supernatural calmness and prophecising of his (Vervain's) death terrify him into fleeing, and he is never seen again.\n*'''Frith:''' A god-figure who created the world and promised that rabbits would always be allowed to thrive. In Lapine, his name literally means \"the sun\".\n*'''El-ahrairah:''' A rabbit [[trickster]] folk hero, who is the protagonist of nearly all of the rabbits' stories. He represents what every rabbit wants to be; smart, devious, tricky, and devoted to the well-being of his warren. In Lapine, his name is a contraction of the phrase ''Elil-hrair-rah'', which means \"prince with a thousand enemies\". His stories of cleverness (and excessive hubris) are similar to [[Br'er Rabbit]] and [[Anansi]]. His name is pronounced with the same cadence as the phrase \"Never say die\", thus, \"El-a-hrai-rah\".\n*'''Prince Rainbow:''' A god-figure who serves as a foil to El-ahrairah.

He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.\n*'''Fiver:''' A [[runt]] rabbit whose name literally means \"Little Thousand\" (rabbits have a single word, \"hrair\", for all numbers greater than four; Fiver's name in Lapine, ''Hrairoo'', indicates that he is the smallest of a litter of five or more rabbits)<ref>{{cite book |last= Adams |first= Richard |title= Watership Down |location= New York |publisher= Scribner |edition= 1st Scribner trade paperback |year= 2005 |page= 5 |isbn=0-7432-7770-8 |quote= There were probably more than five rabbits in the litter when Fiver was born, but his name, ''Hrairoo'', means \"Little Thousand\"{{snd}} i.e. the little one of a lot or, as they say of pigs, the \"runt.\"}}</ref> and Hazel's younger brother. As a seer, he has visions and strong instincts. Fiver is one of the most intelligent rabbits in the group. He is shy, quiet, kind and intuitive with common sense, and though he does not directly act as a leader, the others listen to and follow his advice. Vilthuril becomes his mate.\n*'''Bigwig:''' An ex-Owsla officer, and the largest and bravest rabbit of the group. His name in Lapine is ''Thlayli'', which literally means \"Fur-head\" and refers to the shock of fur on the back of his head. Though he is powerful and fierce, he is also shown to be cunning in his own way when he devises a plan to defeat the larger and stronger General Woundwort. His final battle with Woundwort leaves him severely wounded, but he survives and becomes the leader of Hazel's Owsla.\n*'''Blackberry:''' A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He is often capable of understanding concepts the other rabbits find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.\n*'''Holly:''' Former captain of the Sandleford Warren Owsla, escapes with Bluebell when his warren is destroyed by men. He is near death when he finds the warren at Watership Down, but is nursed back to health and becomes one of Hazel's most trusted companions.\n*'''Bluebell:''' Buck rabbit who escapes with Holly during the destruction of Sandleford and tells jokes to cope and help Holly recover from the mental strain of seeing the Sandleford warren destroyed. He will often jokingly speak in rhyme.\n*'''Strawberry:''' Buck from Cowslip's warren who leaves with the Watership Down rabbits after his doe is killed by a snare. Strawberry is strong and sleek but not as hardy as the other rabbits given his warren upbringing but learns quickly and gets along well with the group. It is for this reason that he is selected to represent the rabbits on an expedition to Efrafa.\n*'''Haystack:''' One of the hutch rabbits who escapes in order to live with the wild rabbits.\n*'''Buckthorn:''' A strong buck who was expected to be part of the Sandleford Owsla once he reached maturity.\n*'''Hawkbit:''' Described in the book as a \"rather stupid rabbit\" but is accepted by Hazel regardless.\n*'''Dandelion:''' A buck rabbit notable for his storytelling ability and speed. He is instrumental in luring the Nuthanger Farm dog into the Efrafans during the siege of Watership Down.\n*'''Silver:''' A strong buck rabbit, given his name for his silver-grey fur, he fights alongside Bigwig and helps defend the rabbits during their journey. He is teased for his silver fur at the Sandleford warren which is one of the reasons he was more willing to leave.\n*'''Pipkin:''' A small and timid buck rabbit, who looks to Hazel as big brother, guidance and protection. Hazel encourages him, and Pipkin grows loyal to Hazel. He proves to be a constant comforter, particularly for Holly after the destruction of Sandleford warren. His name is Hlao-roo in Lapine.\n*'''Hyzenthlay:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa and assists Bigwig in arranging for the liberation of its inhabitants. General Woundwort, who suspects her of fomenting dissension, orders his guards to keep a close eye on her. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig. Like Fiver, she has visions. Her name means literally \"shine-dew-fur\", or \"fur shining like dew\".\n*'''Vilthuril:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa. Similar to Fiver and Hyzenthlay, it is understood that she has visions and is a seer. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig, Hyzenthlay and the other does. She becomes Fiver's mate and is said to be the only one to understand him as well as Hazel.\n*'''Blackavar:''' A rabbit with dark fur who tries to escape from Efrafa but is apprehended, mutilated, and put on display to discourage further escape attempts. When he is liberated by Bigwig, he quickly proves himself an expert tracker and ranger, and also shows himself to be an effective fighter when the Efrafan rabbits attack the warren. [[File:Chroicocephalus ridibundus (summer).jpg|thumb|right|Kehaar is a [[black-headed gull]] (''Chroicocephalus ridibundus''; pictured with summer plumage)]]\n*'''Kehaar:''' A [[black-headed gull]] who is forced, by an injured wing, to take refuge on Watership Down, and befriends the rabbits when they help him. He is characterised by his frequent impatience, guttural accent and unusual phrasing. After discovering the Efrafa warren and helping the rabbits, he rejoins his colony, but promises to visit. According to Adams, Kehaar was based on a fighter from the [[Norwegian Resistance]] in [[World War II]].<ref name= \"Intro\">Adams, Richard. \"Introduction.\" ''Watership Down'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] U.S. edition, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-7770-8}}.</ref>\n*'''The Mouse:''' Never named, the mouse is a resident of Watership Down before the arrival of the rabbits. While rabbits usually despise mice and other rodents, who tend to be liars and untrustworthy according to Bigwig, Hazel kindly saves the mouse from a [[kestrel]]. This action allies the mice and rabbits on Watership Down, and the same mouse later warns them of General Woundwort's intended surprise attack, thus saving many lives.\n*'''General Woundwort:''' The main [[antagonist]] of the novel, a fearless, cunning and brutally efficient rabbit who was orphaned at a young age, Woundwort founded the Efrafa warren and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks mercy and kindness. He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren as an act of revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery. After his apparent death fighting the Nuthanger farm dog, he lives on in rabbit legend as a [[bogeyman]].\n*'''Captain Campion:''' Woundwort's most trusted subordinate, Campion is a loyal, brave and clever officer. After Woundwort disappears, he becomes the Chief Rabbit of Efrafa and reforms it, making peace with the Watership rabbits.\n*'''Vervain:''' The head of the Council police in Efrafa, said to be one of the most hated rabbits in the warren. When Woundwort's forces storm the Honeycomb, he is ordered by Woundwort to kill Fiver, but Fiver's supernatural calmness and prophecising of his (Vervain's) death terrify him into fleeing, and he is never seen again.\n*'''Frith:''' A god-figure who created the world and promised that rabbits would always be allowed to thrive. In Lapine, his name literally means \"the sun\".\n*'''El-ahrairah:''' A rabbit [[trickster]] folk hero, who is the protagonist of nearly all of the rabbits' stories. He represents what every rabbit wants to be; smart, devious, tricky, and devoted to the well-being of his warren. In Lapine, his name is a contraction of the phrase ''Elil-hrair-rah'', which means \"prince with a thousand enemies\". His stories of cleverness (and excessive hubris) are similar to [[Br'er Rabbit]] and [[Anansi]]. His name is pronounced with the same cadence as the phrase \"Never say die\", thus, \"El-a-hrai-rah\".\n*'''Prince Rainbow:''' A god-figure who serves as a foil to El-ahrairah. He attempts to rein in El-ahrairah several times, but is always outsmarted by the rabbit.\n*'''Rabscuttle:''' Another mythical folk hero, Rabscuttle is El-ahrairah's second in command and the Owsla leader. He participates in many of the El-ahrairah's capers. He is considered to be almost as clever as his chief.\n*'''Black Rabbit of Inl\u00e9:''' A sombre [[ghost|phantom]] servant of the god Frith who appears in rabbit [[folklore]] as a kind of analogue to the [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]], and similarly ensures all rabbits die at their predestined time. \"Inl\u00e9\" is the Lapine term for the moon or darkness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Watership Down|last=Adams|first=Richard|publisher=Scribner|date=1972 (This edition 2005)|isbn=978-0-7432-7770-9|location=New York, London, Toronto, Sydney|pages=1\u2013476}}</ref>\n\n==Lapine language==\n{{main|Lapine language}}\n\n\"Lapine\" is a [[fictional language]] created by author [[Richard Adams]] for the novel, where it is spoken by the rabbit characters.

This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his study of [[comparative mythology]], ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), and in particular, Campbell's \"[[monomyth]]\" theory, also based on [[Carl Jung]]'s view of the unconscious mind, that \"all the stories in the world are really one story.\"<ref name=\"CR-Bridgman\">{{cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Joan|date=August 2000|title=Richard Adams at Eighty|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/RICHARD+ADAMS+AT+EIGHTY.-a064752236|journal=[[Contemporary Review|The Contemporary Review]]|publisher=The Contemporary Review Company Limited|volume=277|issue=1615|page=108|issn=0010-7565|via=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of the hero has invited comparisons between ''Watership Down's'' characters and those in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.<ref name=\"masterplots\" /> Hazel's courage, Bigwig's strength, Blackberry's ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion's and Bluebell's poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''Odyssey''.<ref name=\"rothen\">{{cite journal | last = Rothen | first = Kathleen J. |author2=Beverly Langston | title = Hazel, Fiver, Odysseus, and You: An Odyssey into Critical Thinking | journal = The English Journal | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 56\u201359 | publisher = [[National Council of Teachers of English]] |date=March 1987 | issn = 1544-6166}}</ref> Kenneth Kitchell declared, \"Hazel stands in the tradition of [[Odysseus]], [[Aeneas]], and others\".<ref name=\"kitchell\">{{cite journal | last = Kitchell, Jr. | first = Kenneth F. | title = The Shrinking of the Epic Hero: From Homer to Richard Adams's Watership Down | journal = Classical and Modern Literature: A Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 13\u201330 | date = Fall 1986 | issn = 0197-2227}}</ref> [[J.
