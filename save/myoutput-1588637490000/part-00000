He played in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Minnesota Twins]], [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Florida Marlins]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe graduated from [[San Diego High School]] in 1993, and the [[University of Southern California]], where he had a stellar career. In {{Baseball year|1994}}, he was a first team all-American outfielder for the Trojans. In {{Baseball year|1996}}, he was a member of the [[Baseball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|US Olympic Baseball team]]. In 1993, he was named player of the year in the SCL with, .332 batting average, 33 home runs, and 124 RBI.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Minnesota Twins===\nJacque was drafted by the [[Minnesota Twins]] in the second round of the {{Baseball year|1996}} amateur draft. He played three seasons in the minor leagues, and was brought up to the majors in {{Baseball year|1999}}. He started off in [[Center fielder|center field]], but moved to [[Left field|left]] to accommodate [[Torii Hunter]]. Between {{Baseball year|2002}}-{{Baseball year|2003}}, he [[Batting average (baseball)|batted]] over .300, and went to the playoffs with the Twins. The Twins outfield was one of the fastest in baseball in {{Baseball year|2005}}, boasting Jones, Hunter and [[Shannon Stewart (baseball)|Shannon Stewart]]. With the acquisition of Stewart, Jones was moved to [[right field]]. Jacque was able to hit for power and averaged 20 [[home run]]s between {{Baseball year|2000}}-2005.\n    \nJones officially ended his relationship with the Twins by turning down arbitration on December 19, 2005. After considering a deal to play for [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis]], he signed a three-year deal with the [[Chicago Cubs]] just a day later.<ref>ESPN.com news services, [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2266855 Cubs agree to terms with outfielder Jacque Jones], ESPN.com, Retrieved on July 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\nOn August 15, 2006, Jones [http://mlb.mlb.com/media/player/mp_tpl_3_1.jsp?w_id=511781&w=2006/open/tp/archive08/081506_chnhou_jones_hr_tp_350.wmv hit a home run over the center field wall] against [[Roger Clemens]] at [[Astros Field|Minute Maid Park]], well over 440 feet. He finished the {{Baseball year|2006}} season strong with a .285 batting average, tied his career best with 27 home runs.\n    \nAfter the 2006 season, it appeared Jones' future with Chicago was uncertain. It was rumored that he had requested a trade and a deal as in the works, but on February 17, 2007, he asked to not be traded, and that he was hoping to have a comeback year. Jones remained with the Cubs to start the {{Baseball year|2007}} season, though he was never really accepted by the fan base, partly due to his lack of production and partly due to questionable comments regarding the teams decision to fire [[Dusty Baker]], whom Jones said he came to Chicago to play for.
