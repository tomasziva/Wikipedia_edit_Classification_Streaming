Located {{convert|2.5|mi}} south of the village of [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], [[Wisconsin]], United States, the {{convert|600|acre|adj=on}} property was developed on land that originally belonged to Wright's maternal family.\n\nWright designed the main Taliesin home and studio, after leaving his first wife and home in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] with his mistress, [[Mamah Borthwick]]. The design of the original building was consistent with the design principles of the [[Prairie School]], emulating the flatness of the plains and the natural [[limestone]] outcroppings of Wisconsin's [[Driftless Area]]. The structure (which included agricultural and studio wings) was completed in 1911.  The name, Taliesin, meaning 'shining-brow' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], was initially used for this building (built on and into the brow of a hill or ridge) and later for the entire estate.\n\nWright rebuilt the Taliesin residential wing in 1914 after a disgruntled employee set fire to the living quarters and murdered Borthwick and six others. This second version was used only sparingly by Wright as he worked on projects abroad. He returned to the house in 1922 following completion of the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in [[Tokyo]]. A fire caused by electrical problems destroyed the living quarters in April 1925. The third version of the living quarters was constructed by Wright by late 1925.\n\nIn 1927, financial problems caused a [[foreclosure]] on the building by the Bank of Wisconsin. Wright was able to reacquire the building with the financial help of friends and was able to reoccupy it as of November, 1928. In 1932, he established a fellowship for architectural students at the estate.  Taliesin III was Wright's home for the rest of his life, although he began to winter at [[Taliesin West]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] upon its completion in 1937. Many of Wright's acclaimed buildings were designed here, including [[Fallingwater]], [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House|\"Jacobs I\"]] (the first Wright-designed residence of Herbert and Katherine Jacobs), the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]], and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. Wright was also an avid collector of Asian art and used Taliesin as a storehouse and private museum.\n\nWright left Taliesin and the 600-acre Taliesin Estate to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation (founded by him and his third wife in 1940) upon his death in 1959. This organization oversaw renovations to the estate until late 1992 upon the founding of [[Taliesin Preservation, Inc.]], a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to preserving the building and estate in Wisconsin. Taliesin mostly operates as a [[museum]], however it is still occupied by former students of Wright's in addition to students at [[The School of Architecture at Taliesin]] on a seasonal basis.\n\nThe property was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976, and was inscribed as part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in July 2019. In addition to the residence, there are four Frank Lloyd Wright-designed buildings on the estate, which were built before the main building, when the land was still the property of Wright's maternal family: the [[Romeo and Juliet Windmill]], designed by Wright in 1896; [[Tan-y-Deri]], the home he designed for Jane and Andrew Porter, his sister and brother-in-law, in 1907; the [[Hillside Home School II|Hillside Home School]], originally designed in 1901 for his aunts' school; and [[Midway Barn]], a farming facility.\n\n==Location==\nJones Valley, the [[Wisconsin River]] valley in which Taliesin sits, was formed during [[Pre-Illinoian]] glaciation. This region of North America, known as the [[Driftless Area]], was totally surrounded by ice during [[Wisconsin glaciation]], but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is an unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge|publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]|url=http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=32596|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Mickelson|Attig|1999|p=93}}\n\nThe valley, approximately {{convert|2.5|mi}} south of the village of [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]],{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=3}} was originally settled by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s maternal grandfather, Richard Lloyd Jones. Jones had emigrated with his family from [[Wales]], moving to the [[Ixonia, Wisconsin|Town of Ixonia]] in [[Jefferson County, Wisconsin]]. In 1858, Jones and the family moved from Ixonia to this part of Wisconsin to start a farm.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tauscher|first=Cathy|last2=Hughes|first2=Peter|title=Jenkin Lloyd Jones|series=Dictionary of Unitarian Universalist Biography|publisher=Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage Society|year=2007|url=http://uudb.org/articles/jenkinlloydjones.html|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> By the 1870s, Richard's sons had taken over operation of the farm, and they invited Wright to work during summers as a farmhand.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=35}}\n[[Image:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Wright designed the second Hillside Home School in 1901, alongside an earlier school he designed in 1887.]]\n\nWright's aunts Jane and Ellen C. Lloyd Jones (known as Jennie and Nell) began a [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational school]], the [[Hillside Home School I|Hillside Home School]], in the family valley in 1887 and let Wright design the building; this was Wright's first independent commission. In 1896, Wright's aunts again commissioned Wright, this time to build a windmill. The resulting [[Romeo and Juliet Windmill]] was unorthodox but stable. In the winter of 1900, Wright compiled a portfolio of photographs he took of the surrounding area for a promotional brochure for the Hillside School.\n\nIn 1901, Wright was again commissioned by Jennie and Nell to design another structure. Unsatisfied with his original design for the Hillside School, Wright designed the Hillside Home School in 1901 in the [[Prairie School|Prairie Style]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=35}} Wright later sent several of his children to receive an education at the school.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=56}} Wright's final commission on the farm was a house for his sister Jane Porter in 1907. Tan-Y-Deri, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for \"Under the Oaks\", was a design based on his recent ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' article \"[[A Fireproof House for $5000]].\" The family, their ideas, religion, and ideals, greatly influenced the young Wright, who later changed his middle name from Lincoln (in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) to Lloyd in deference to his mother's family.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=35}}\n\nWhen Wright decided to construct a home in this valley, he chose the name of the Welsh [[bard]] [[Taliesin]], whose name means \"shining brow\" or \"radiant brow\". Wright learned of the poet through [[Richard Hovey]]'s ''Taliesin: A Masque'', a story about an artist's struggle for identity.{{sfn|Menocal|1992|pp=44\u201345}} The Welsh name also suited Wright's roots, as the Lloyd Joneses gave Welsh names to their properties.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=167}} The hill upon which Taliesin was built was a favorite from Wright's youth; he saw the house as a \"shining brow\" on the hill.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=170}}{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=114}} Although the name was originally only applied to the house, Wright later used the term to refer to the entire property. Wright and others used roman numerals to distinguish the three versions of the house.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=5}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright.jpg|thumb|Frank Lloyd Wright's home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. Wright first lived here in 1889 and used it as a studio starting in 1898.]]\nFrom 1898 to 1909, [[architect]] Frank Lloyd Wright lived and worked out of his [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|home and studio]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], [[Illinois]]. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of [[Prairie School]] architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing [[Edwin H. Cheney House|a home]] for [[Edwin Cheney]], but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=16}}\n\nThey met up in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by [[Michelozzo]]'s [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]] because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=27}}\n\nIn 1910, the pair sought to return to the United States, but knew they could not escape scandal if they returned together to Oak Park.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=17\u201319}} Wright saw an alternative\u2014his family's ancestral farm near Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wright returned alone to the United States in late 1910, publicly reconciling with Kitty while working to secure money to buy land for a house for himself and Borthwick.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=207-08}} On April&nbsp;3, 1911, Wright wrote to a friend requesting money to purchase \"a small house\" for his mother.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=209}}\n\nBy the 10th, Wright's mother Anna had a signed deed for the property. By using Anna's name, Wright was able to secure the {{convert|31.5|acre|adj=on}} property without attracting any attention to the affair.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=25}}{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=4}} Late in the summer, [[Mamah Borthwick]] (having [[divorce]]d Cheney and legally reverting to her maiden name){{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=207}} quietly moved into the property, staying with Wright's sister at [[Tan-y-Deri]]. However, Wright and Borthwick's new property was discovered by a ''[[Chicago Examiner]]'' reporter that fall, and the affair made headlines in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on Christmas Eve. {{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=57}}{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=212}}\n\n==Taliesin I==\n[[File:Taliesin I winter.jpg|thumb|An early photograph of Taliesin, taken during its first winter, 1911\u201312]]\nThe Taliesin house had three sections: two broad portions on either end and a narrow connecting [[loggia]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=175}} Typical of a [[Prairie School]] design, the house was, as Wright described, \"low, wide, and snug.\"{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=174}} As with most of his houses, Wright designed the furniture.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=174}} One of these broad sections was used as Wright's studio and workroom. A small apartment wing juts out of this wing; the apartment may have originally been intended for Wright's mother, but was used by Wright's head draftsman.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=24}} Wright and Borthwick lived in the other broad portion. The one-story complex was accessed by a road leading up the hill to the rear of the building.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=175}} The estate gateway was on County Road C, just west of [[Wisconsin Highway 23|Wisconsin Road 23]]. Iron entry gates were flanked by limestone piers capped with planter urns.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=10}}\n\nWright chose yellow [[limestone]] for the house from a quarry of outcropping ledges on a nearby hill. Local farmers helped Wright move the stone up the Taliesin hill. Stones were laid in long, thin ledges, evoking the natural way that they were found in the quarry and across the Driftless Area.{{sfn|Wright|1943|pp=170\u2013171}} Plaster for the interior walls was mixed with [[sienna]], giving the finished product a golden hue.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=173}} This caused the plaster to resemble the sand on the banks of the nearby Wisconsin River.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=17}} \n\nThe outside plaster walls were similar, but mixed with cement, resulting in a grayer color. Windows were placed so that sun could come through openings in every room at every point of the day. Wright chose not to install gutters so that [[icicle]]s would form in winter.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=173}} [[Wood shingle|Shingles]] on the gradually-pitched roof were designed to weather to a silver-grey color, matching the branches of nearby trees.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=16}} A [[porte-coch\u00e8re]] was built over the main entrance of the living quarters to provide shelter for visiting automobiles.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=14}} The finished house measured approximately {{convert|12000|sqft}} of enclosed space.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=6}}\n\n===Life at Taliesin===\nUpon moving in with Borthwick in the winter 1911, Wright resumed work on his architectural projects, but he struggled to secure commissions because of the ongoing negative publicity over his affair with Borthwick (whose ex-husband, [[Edwin Cheney]], maintained main [[Child custody|custody]] of their son and daughter). However, Wright did produce some of his most acclaimed works during this time period, including the [[Midway Gardens]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Avery Coonley House|Avery Coonley Playhouse]] in [[Riverside, Illinois|Riverside]]. He also indulged his hobby for collecting [[Japanese art]], and quickly became a renowned authority. Borthwick translated four works from Swedish [[difference feminist]] [[Ellen Key]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=131}}\n[[File:Taliesin I courtyard.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of the completed complex as seen from the tea circle in the summer of 1912. The studio is to the left and the living quarters are to the right; the loggia is in between.]]\n\nIn his spare time, Wright developed a fruit farm on the property with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the orchard was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]], fifty [[Wealthy (apple)|Wealthy]], fifty [[Russet apple|Golden Russet]], and fifty [[Snow apple|Fameuse]]. Among the bushes were three hundred [[gooseberry]], two hundred [[blackberry]], and two hundred [[raspberry]]. The property also grew [[pear]]s, [[asparagus]], [[rhubarb]], and [[plum]]s.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=176}} \n\nThe fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the [[contour plowing|contour]] of the estate, which may have been done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=177}} Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This [[water garden]], probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=178}}\n\nIn 1912, Wright designed what he called a \"tea circle\" in the middle of the courtyard, adjacent to the crown of the hill. This circle was heavily inspired by Jens Jensen's [[council circle]]s, but also took influence from Japanese [[wabi-sabi]] landscape architecture. Unlike Jensen's circles, the rough-cut limestone tea circle was much larger and featured a pool in the center.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=179}} The circle featured a curved stone bench flanked with Chinese jars built during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. A large oak tree stood at the center until it blew down in a storm in 1998.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=34}} The tea garden also included a large plaster replica of ''Flower in the Crannied Wall'', a statue originally designed by [[Richard Bock]] for the [[Dana-Thomas House|Susan Lawrence Dana House]]; the [[Flower in the crannied wall|namesake poem]] is inscribed on its rear.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=40}}\n\n===Attack and fire===<!-- Julian Carlton redirects here -->\nJulian Carlton was a 31-year-old man who came to work as a chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an [[Afro-Caribbean]] of [[West Indian]] descent, ostensibly from [[Barbados]]. He was recommended to Wright by John Vogelsong Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914, would be his last day in their employ.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=192}}\n[[File:Taliesin Hatchet.jpg|thumb|The hatchet used in the Taliesin attacks]]\nBefore he left, Carlton plotted to kill the residents of Taliesin. His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle, who had called Carlton a \"black son-of-a-bitch\" on August 12 for not following an order. Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=192}} He planned the assault, targeting the noon hour, when Borthwick, her children, and the studio personnel would be on opposite sides of the property awaiting lunch. Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children, 11-year old John and 9-year-old Martha.\n\nOn August 15, Carlton grabbed a shingling [[hatchet]] and began an attack. He started with the Borthwicks, who were waiting on the porch off the living room. Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the face, and her son John was slaughtered as he sat in his chair. Martha managed to flee, but was hunted down and slain in the courtyard. He then coated the bodies in [[gasoline]] and lit them on fire, setting the house ablaze.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}}\n\nCarlton then turned his attention to the other six residents, pouring [[gasoline]] underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/wright-mare-massacre-frank-lloyd-home-article-1.1591522|author=Mara Bovsun |title=Cook massacres seven at Wisconsin home Frank Lloyd Wright built for his mistress |newspaper=New York Daily News|date=January 25, 2014 |access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref> though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later.\n\nCarlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of [[hydrochloric acid]] with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt [[suicide]] by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-massacre-at-frank-lloyd-wrights-love-cottage|title=The Massacre at Frank Lloyd Wright's \"Love Cottage\"|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>\n\nLindblom and Weston alerted a neighboring farm of the attack. Weston then returned to the studio and used a garden hose to help extinguish the flames. His efforts saved the studio portion of the building and the many Wright manuscripts. Eventually, neighbors arrived to assist in putting out the fire and to search for survivors. [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]] Sheriff John Williams located Carlton and arrested him. Carlton was transferred to the county jail in [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}}  Gertrude was found in a nearby field, apparently unaware of her husband's intentions. She was dressed in travel clothes, expecting to catch a train to Chicago with Julian to seek a new job.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=192}}\n[[File:Taliesin After Fire.jpg|thumb|It's believed the man on the left is Frank Lloyd Wright, surveying the damage after the fire.]]\nGertrude was released from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was never heard from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him, but did badly burn his [[esophagus]], which made it difficult for him to ingest food. Carlton was [[indictment|indicted]] on August 16 and was charged with the [[murder]] of Emil Brodelle, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton entered a not guilty plea. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case could be heard, Carlton died of starvation in his cell.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=195\u2013196}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Klein |first1=Christopher |title=The Massacre at Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s \u201cLove Cottage\u201d |url=https://www.history.com/news/the-massacre-at-frank-lloyd-wrights-love-cottage |accessdate=2 March 2020 |work=HISTORY |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nBodies of the dead and injured were brought to [[Tan-y-Deri]], the nearby home of Wright's sister, Jane Porter. Wright returned to Taliesin that night with his son [[John Lloyd Wright|John]] and Edwin Cheney.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}} Cheney brought the remains of his children back to Chicago while Wright buried Mamah Borthwick on the grounds of nearby [[Unity Chapel]] {{sfn|Weekly Home News|August 20, 1914}} (the chapel of the mother's side of his family). Heartbroken over the loss of his lover, Wright did not mark the grave because he could not bear to be reminded of the tragedy.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=193}} He also did not hold a funerary service for Borthwick, although he did fund and attend services for his employees.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=194}} \n\nWright struggled with the loss of Borthwick, experiencing symptoms of [[conversion disorder]]: [[insomnia]], weight loss, and temporary blindness.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=262}} After a few months of recovery, aided by his sister Jane Porter, Wright moved to an apartment he rented in Chicago at 25 Cedar Street.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=198}} The attack also had a profound effect on Wright's design principles; biographer Robert Twombly writes that his Prairie School period ended after the loss of Borthwick.{{sfn|Drennan|2007|p=157}}\n\n==Taliesin II==\n[[File:Taliesin II Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of Taliesin II]]\nWithin a few months of his recovery, Wright began work on rebuilding Taliesin.{{sfn|Drennan|2007|p=160}} The new complex was mostly identical to the original building. The dam was rebuilt; Wright added an observation platform, perhaps inspired by the [[Observation Platform for Island Woolen Mills|one he designed]] in [[Baraboo, Wisconsin|Baraboo]].{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=68}} Later, he built a hydroelectric generator in an unsuccessful effort to make Taliesin completely self-sufficient. The generator was built in the style of a Japanese temple. Within only a few years, parts of the structure eroded away. It was demolished in the 1940s.{{sfn|Henning|2011|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nIn the new Taliesin, Wright worked to repair his tarnished reputation. He secured a commission to design the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]; when the building was undamaged following the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 earthquake]], Wright's reputation was restored. Although he later expanded the agricultural wing, Wright spent little time at the second Taliesin house, often living near his construction sites abroad.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=50}} Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=138}} Wright only truly lived at Taliesin II starting in 1922, after his work at the Imperial Hotel was completed.{{sfn|Packard|Korab|Hunt|1980|p=698}}\n\nIn 1914 while designing the residence after the first devastating fire, Wright received a sympathetic letter from Miriam Noel, a fan of his architecture. Wright exchanged correspondence with the wealthy divorcee and met with her at his Chicago office. Wright was quickly infatuated, and the two began a relationship. By Spring 1915, Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with Wright. Wright's first wife Catherine finally granted him a [[divorce]] in 1922,{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=271}} meaning that Wright could marry Noel a year later.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=279}} Although Wright admired Noel's erratic personality at first, her behavior (later identified as [[schizophrenia]]) led to a miserable life together at Taliesin.{{sfn|Huxtable|2004|loc=Chapter 7}} They married in November 1923, but Noel left Wright by the spring of 1924.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=280}}\n\nOn April 20, 1925, Wright returned from eating dinner in the detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright was able to get help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared.{{sfn|Wright|1943|pp=261\u2013262}} According to Wright's [[autobiography]], the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=262}}\n\n==Taliesin III==\n[[Image:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Taliesin]]\nWright was deeply in debt following the destruction of Taliesin II. Aside from debts owed on the property, his divorce from Noel forced Wright to sell much of his farm machinery and livestock. Wright was also forced to sell his prized Japanese prints at half value to pay his debts. The [[Bank of Wisconsin]] [[foreclosure|foreclosed]] on Taliesin in 1927 and Wright was forced to move to [[La Jolla, California]]. \n\nShortly before the bank was to begin an auction on the property, Wright's former client Darwin Martin conceived a scheme to save the property. He formed a company called Frank Lloyd Wright Incorporated to issue stock on Wright's future earnings. Many of Wright's former clients and students purchased stock in Wright to raise $70,000. The company successfully bid on Taliesin for $40,000, returning it to Wright.\n\n[[File:TaliesinWest03 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|Starting in 1937, Wright wintered at [[Taliesin West]] in [[Arizona]].]]\nWright returned to Taliesin in the winter of 1928 and began to rebuild the complex, which he named Taliesin III, shortly afterward.

In 1928, Wright conceived the idea of hosting a school there and issued a proposal to the [[University of Wisconsin]] that would have created the Hillside Home School for the Allied Arts; however, the plan was later abandoned.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2001|p=9}} In 1932, the Wrights instead established the private Taliesin Fellowship, where fifty to sixty apprentices could come to Taliesin to study under the architect's mentorship. Students helped him develop the estate at a time when Wright received few commissions for his work. So, the architect had his apprentices work on the Hillside Home School building, renovating the original school gymnasium into a theater, and construct a drafting studio and dormitories. In 1937, Wright designed and the apprentices began construction on a winter home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]], which became known as [[Taliesin West]].

Located {{convert|2.5|mi}} south of the village of [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], [[Wisconsin]], United States, the {{convert|600|acre|adj=on}} property was developed on land that originally belonged to Wright's maternal family.\n\nWright designed the main Taliesin home and studio, after leaving his first wife and home in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] with his mistress, [[Mamah Borthwick]]. The design of the original building was consistent with the design principles of the [[Prairie School]], emulating the flatness of the plains and the natural [[limestone]] outcroppings of Wisconsin's [[Driftless Area]]. The structure (which included agricultural and studio wings) was completed in 1911.  The name, Taliesin, meaning 'shining-brow' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], was initially used for this building (built on and into the brow of a hill or ridge) and later for the entire estate.\n\nWright rebuilt the Taliesin residential wing in 1914 after a disgruntled employee set fire to the living quarters and murdered Borthwick and six others. This second version was used only sparingly by Wright as he worked on projects abroad. He returned to the house in 1922 following completion of the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in [[Tokyo]]. A fire caused by electrical problems destroyed the living quarters in April 1925. The third version of the living quarters was constructed by Wright by late 1925.\n\nIn 1927, financial problems caused a [[foreclosure]] on the building by the Bank of Wisconsin. Wright was able to reacquire the building with the financial help of friends and was able to reoccupy it as of November, 1928. In 1932, he established a fellowship for architectural students at the estate.  Taliesin III was Wright's home for the rest of his life, although he began to winter at [[Taliesin West]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] upon its completion in 1937. Many of Wright's acclaimed buildings were designed here, including [[Fallingwater]], [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House|\"Jacobs I\"]] (the first Wright-designed residence of Herbert and Katherine Jacobs), the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]], and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. Wright was also an avid collector of Asian art and used Taliesin as a storehouse and private museum.\n\nWright left Taliesin and the 600-acre Taliesin Estate to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation (founded by him and his third wife in 1940) upon his death in 1959. This organization oversaw renovations to the estate until late 1992 upon the founding of [[Taliesin Preservation, Inc.]], a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to preserving the building and estate in Wisconsin. Taliesin mostly operates as a [[museum]], however it is still occupied by former students of Wright's in addition to students at [[The School of Architecture at Taliesin]] on a seasonal basis.\n\nThe property was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976, and was inscribed as part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in July 2019. In addition to the residence, there are four Frank Lloyd Wright-designed buildings on the estate, which were built before the main building, when the land was still the property of Wright's maternal family: the [[Romeo and Juliet Windmill]], designed by Wright in 1896; [[Tan-y-Deri]], the home he designed for Jane and Andrew Porter, his sister and brother-in-law, in 1907; the [[Hillside Home School II|Hillside Home School]], originally designed in 1901 for his aunts' school; and [[Midway Barn]], a farming facility.\n\n==Location==\nJones Valley, the [[Wisconsin River]] valley in which Taliesin sits, was formed during [[Pre-Illinoian]] glaciation. This region of North America, known as the [[Driftless Area]], was totally surrounded by ice during [[Wisconsin glaciation]], but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is an unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge|publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]|url=http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=32596|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Mickelson|Attig|1999|p=93}}\n\nThe valley, approximately {{convert|2.5|mi}} south of the village of [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]],{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=3}} was originally settled by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s maternal grandfather, Richard Lloyd Jones. Jones had emigrated with his family from [[Wales]], moving to the [[Ixonia, Wisconsin|Town of Ixonia]] in [[Jefferson County, Wisconsin]]. In 1858, Jones and the family moved from Ixonia to this part of Wisconsin to start a farm.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tauscher|first=Cathy|last2=Hughes|first2=Peter|title=Jenkin Lloyd Jones|series=Dictionary of Unitarian Universalist Biography|publisher=Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage Society|year=2007|url=http://uudb.org/articles/jenkinlloydjones.html|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> By the 1870s, Richard's sons had taken over operation of the farm, and they invited Wright to work during summers as a farmhand.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=35}}\n[[Image:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Wright designed the second Hillside Home School in 1901, alongside an earlier school he designed in 1887.]]\n\nWright's aunts Jane and Ellen C. Lloyd Jones (known as Jennie and Nell) began a [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational school]], the [[Hillside Home School I|Hillside Home School]], in the family valley in 1887 and let Wright design the building; this was Wright's first independent commission. In 1896, Wright's aunts again commissioned Wright, this time to build a windmill. The resulting [[Romeo and Juliet Windmill]] was unorthodox but stable. In the winter of 1900, Wright compiled a portfolio of photographs he took of the surrounding area for a promotional brochure for the Hillside School.\n\nIn 1901, Wright was again commissioned by Jennie and Nell to design another structure. Unsatisfied with his original design for the Hillside School, Wright designed the Hillside Home School in 1901 in the [[Prairie School|Prairie Style]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=35}} Wright later sent several of his children to receive an education at the school.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=56}} Wright's final commission on the farm was a house for his sister Jane Porter in 1907. Tan-Y-Deri, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for \"Under the Oaks\", was a design based on his recent ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' article \"[[A Fireproof House for $5000]].\" The family, their ideas, religion, and ideals, greatly influenced the young Wright, who later changed his middle name from Lincoln (in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) to Lloyd in deference to his mother's family.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=35}}\n\nWhen Wright decided to construct a home in this valley, he chose the name of the Welsh [[bard]] [[Taliesin]], whose name means \"shining brow\" or \"radiant brow\". Wright learned of the poet through [[Richard Hovey]]'s ''Taliesin: A Masque'', a story about an artist's struggle for identity.{{sfn|Menocal|1992|pp=44\u201345}} The Welsh name also suited Wright's roots, as the Lloyd Joneses gave Welsh names to their properties.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=167}} The hill upon which Taliesin was built was a favorite from Wright's youth; he saw the house as a \"shining brow\" on the hill.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=170}}{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=114}} Although the name was originally only applied to the house, Wright later used the term to refer to the entire property. Wright and others used roman numerals to distinguish the three versions of the house.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=5}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright.jpg|thumb|Frank Lloyd Wright's home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. Wright first lived here in 1889 and used it as a studio starting in 1898.]]\nFrom 1898 to 1909, [[architect]] Frank Lloyd Wright lived and worked out of his [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|home and studio]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], [[Illinois]]. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of [[Prairie School]] architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing [[Edwin H. Cheney House|a home]] for [[Edwin Cheney]], but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=16}}\n\nThey met up in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by [[Michelozzo]]'s [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]] because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=27}}\n\nIn 1910, the pair sought to return to the United States, but knew they could not escape scandal if they returned together to Oak Park.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=17\u201319}} Wright saw an alternative\u2014his family's ancestral farm near Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wright returned alone to the United States in late 1910, publicly reconciling with Kitty while working to secure money to buy land for a house for himself and Borthwick.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=207-08}} On April&nbsp;3, 1911, Wright wrote to a friend requesting money to purchase \"a small house\" for his mother.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=209}}\n\nBy the 10th, Wright's mother Anna had a signed deed for the property. By using Anna's name, Wright was able to secure the {{convert|31.5|acre|adj=on}} property without attracting any attention to the affair.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=25}}{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=4}} Late in the summer, [[Mamah Borthwick]] (having [[divorce]]d Cheney and legally reverting to her maiden name){{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=207}} quietly moved into the property, staying with Wright's sister at [[Tan-y-Deri]]. However, Wright and Borthwick's new property was discovered by a ''[[Chicago Examiner]]'' reporter that fall, and the affair made headlines in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on Christmas Eve. {{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=57}}{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=212}}\n\n==Taliesin I==\n[[File:Taliesin I winter.jpg|thumb|An early photograph of Taliesin, taken during its first winter, 1911\u201312]]\nThe Taliesin house had three sections: two broad portions on either end and a narrow connecting [[loggia]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=175}} Typical of a [[Prairie School]] design, the house was, as Wright described, \"low, wide, and snug.\"{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=174}} As with most of his houses, Wright designed the furniture.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=174}} One of these broad sections was used as Wright's studio and workroom. A small apartment wing juts out of this wing; the apartment may have originally been intended for Wright's mother, but was used by Wright's head draftsman.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=24}} Wright and Borthwick lived in the other broad portion. The one-story complex was accessed by a road leading up the hill to the rear of the building.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=175}} The estate gateway was on County Road C, just west of [[Wisconsin Highway 23|Wisconsin Road 23]]. Iron entry gates were flanked by limestone piers capped with planter urns.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=10}}\n\nWright chose yellow [[limestone]] for the house from a quarry of outcropping ledges on a nearby hill. Local farmers helped Wright move the stone up the Taliesin hill. Stones were laid in long, thin ledges, evoking the natural way that they were found in the quarry and across the Driftless Area.{{sfn|Wright|1943|pp=170\u2013171}} Plaster for the interior walls was mixed with [[sienna]], giving the finished product a golden hue.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=173}} This caused the plaster to resemble the sand on the banks of the nearby Wisconsin River.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=17}} \n\nThe outside plaster walls were similar, but mixed with cement, resulting in a grayer color. Windows were placed so that sun could come through openings in every room at every point of the day. Wright chose not to install gutters so that [[icicle]]s would form in winter.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=173}} [[Wood shingle|Shingles]] on the gradually-pitched roof were designed to weather to a silver-grey color, matching the branches of nearby trees.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=16}} A [[porte-coch\u00e8re]] was built over the main entrance of the living quarters to provide shelter for visiting automobiles.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=14}} The finished house measured approximately {{convert|12000|sqft}} of enclosed space.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=6}}\n\n===Life at Taliesin===\nUpon moving in with Borthwick in the winter 1911, Wright resumed work on his architectural projects, but he struggled to secure commissions because of the ongoing negative publicity over his affair with Borthwick (whose ex-husband, [[Edwin Cheney]], maintained main [[Child custody|custody]] of their son and daughter). However, Wright did produce some of his most acclaimed works during this time period, including the [[Midway Gardens]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Avery Coonley House|Avery Coonley Playhouse]] in [[Riverside, Illinois|Riverside]]. He also indulged his hobby for collecting [[Japanese art]], and quickly became a renowned authority. Borthwick translated four works from Swedish [[difference feminist]] [[Ellen Key]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=131}}\n[[File:Taliesin I courtyard.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of the completed complex as seen from the tea circle in the summer of 1912. The studio is to the left and the living quarters are to the right; the loggia is in between.]]\n\nIn his spare time, Wright developed a fruit farm on the property with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the orchard was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]], fifty [[Wealthy (apple)|Wealthy]], fifty [[Russet apple|Golden Russet]], and fifty [[Snow apple|Fameuse]]. Among the bushes were three hundred [[gooseberry]], two hundred [[blackberry]], and two hundred [[raspberry]]. The property also grew [[pear]]s, [[asparagus]], [[rhubarb]], and [[plum]]s.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=176}} \n\nThe fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the [[contour plowing|contour]] of the estate, which may have been done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=177}} Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This [[water garden]], probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=178}}\n\nIn 1912, Wright designed what he called a \"tea circle\" in the middle of the courtyard, adjacent to the crown of the hill. This circle was heavily inspired by Jens Jensen's [[council circle]]s, but also took influence from Japanese [[wabi-sabi]] landscape architecture. Unlike Jensen's circles, the rough-cut limestone tea circle was much larger and featured a pool in the center.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=179}} The circle featured a curved stone bench flanked with Chinese jars built during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. A large oak tree stood at the center until it blew down in a storm in 1998.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=34}} The tea garden also included a large plaster replica of ''Flower in the Crannied Wall'', a statue originally designed by [[Richard Bock]] for the [[Dana-Thomas House|Susan Lawrence Dana House]]; the [[Flower in the crannied wall|namesake poem]] is inscribed on its rear.{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=40}}\n\n===Attack and fire===<!-- Julian Carlton redirects here -->\nJulian Carlton was a 31-year-old man who came to work as a chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an [[Afro-Caribbean]] of [[West Indian]] descent, ostensibly from [[Barbados]]. He was recommended to Wright by John Vogelsong Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914, would be his last day in their employ.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=192}}\n[[File:Taliesin Hatchet.jpg|thumb|The hatchet used in the Taliesin attacks]]\nBefore he left, Carlton plotted to kill the residents of Taliesin. His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle, who had called Carlton a \"black son-of-a-bitch\" on August 12 for not following an order. Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=192}} He planned the assault, targeting the noon hour, when Borthwick, her children, and the studio personnel would be on opposite sides of the property awaiting lunch. Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children, 11-year old John and 9-year-old Martha.\n\nOn August 15, Carlton grabbed a shingling [[hatchet]] and began an attack. He started with the Borthwicks, who were waiting on the porch off the living room. Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the face, and her son John was slaughtered as he sat in his chair. Martha managed to flee, but was hunted down and slain in the courtyard. He then coated the bodies in [[gasoline]] and lit them on fire, setting the house ablaze.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}}\n\nCarlton then turned his attention to the other six residents, pouring [[gasoline]] underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/wright-mare-massacre-frank-lloyd-home-article-1.1591522|author=Mara Bovsun |title=Cook massacres seven at Wisconsin home Frank Lloyd Wright built for his mistress |newspaper=New York Daily News|date=January 25, 2014 |access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref> though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later.\n\nCarlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of [[hydrochloric acid]] with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt [[suicide]] by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-massacre-at-frank-lloyd-wrights-love-cottage|title=The Massacre at Frank Lloyd Wright's \"Love Cottage\"|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>\n\nLindblom and Weston alerted a neighboring farm of the attack. Weston then returned to the studio and used a garden hose to help extinguish the flames. His efforts saved the studio portion of the building and the many Wright manuscripts. Eventually, neighbors arrived to assist in putting out the fire and to search for survivors. [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]] Sheriff John Williams located Carlton and arrested him. Carlton was transferred to the county jail in [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]].{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}}  Gertrude was found in a nearby field, apparently unaware of her husband's intentions. She was dressed in travel clothes, expecting to catch a train to Chicago with Julian to seek a new job.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=192}}\n[[File:Taliesin After Fire.jpg|thumb|It's believed the man on the left is Frank Lloyd Wright, surveying the damage after the fire.]]\nGertrude was released from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was never heard from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him, but did badly burn his [[esophagus]], which made it difficult for him to ingest food. Carlton was [[indictment|indicted]] on August 16 and was charged with the [[murder]] of Emil Brodelle, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton entered a not guilty plea. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case could be heard, Carlton died of starvation in his cell.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=195\u2013196}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Klein |first1=Christopher |title=The Massacre at Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s \u201cLove Cottage\u201d |url=https://www.history.com/news/the-massacre-at-frank-lloyd-wrights-love-cottage |accessdate=2 March 2020 |work=HISTORY |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nBodies of the dead and injured were brought to [[Tan-y-Deri]], the nearby home of Wright's sister, Jane Porter. Wright returned to Taliesin that night with his son [[John Lloyd Wright|John]] and Edwin Cheney.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|pp=188\u2013191}} Cheney brought the remains of his children back to Chicago while Wright buried Mamah Borthwick on the grounds of nearby [[Unity Chapel]] {{sfn|Weekly Home News|August 20, 19174}} (the chapel of the mother's side of his family). Heartbroken over the loss of his lover, Wright did not mark the grave because he could not bear to be reminded of the tragedy.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=193}} He also did not hold a funerary service for Borthwick, although he did fund and attend services for his employees.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=194}} \n\nWright struggled with the loss of Borthwick, experiencing symptoms of [[conversion disorder]]: [[insomnia]], weight loss, and temporary blindness.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=262}} After a few months of recovery, aided by his sister Jane Porter, Wright moved to an apartment he rented in Chicago at 25 Cedar Street.{{sfn|McCrea|2012|p=198}} The attack also had a profound effect on Wright's design principles; biographer Robert Twombly writes that his Prairie School period ended after the loss of Borthwick.{{sfn|Drennan|2007|p=157}}\n\n==Taliesin II==\n[[File:Taliesin II Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of Taliesin II]]\nWithin a few months of his recovery, Wright began work on rebuilding Taliesin.{{sfn|Drennan|2007|p=160}} The new complex was mostly identical to the original building. The dam was rebuilt; Wright added an observation platform, perhaps inspired by the [[Observation Platform for Island Woolen Mills|one he designed]] in [[Baraboo, Wisconsin|Baraboo]].{{sfn|Henning|2011|p=68}} Later, he built a hydroelectric generator in an unsuccessful effort to make Taliesin completely self-sufficient. The generator was built in the style of a Japanese temple. Within only a few years, parts of the structure eroded away. It was demolished in the 1940s.{{sfn|Henning|2011|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nIn the new Taliesin, Wright worked to repair his tarnished reputation. He secured a commission to design the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]; when the building was undamaged following the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 earthquake]], Wright's reputation was restored. Although he later expanded the agricultural wing, Wright spent little time at the second Taliesin house, often living near his construction sites abroad.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=50}} Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=138}} Wright only truly lived at Taliesin II starting in 1922, after his work at the Imperial Hotel was completed.{{sfn|Packard|Korab|Hunt|1980|p=698}}\n\nIn 1914 while designing the residence after the first devastating fire, Wright received a sympathetic letter from Miriam Noel, a fan of his architecture. Wright exchanged correspondence with the wealthy divorcee and met with her at his Chicago office. Wright was quickly infatuated, and the two began a relationship. By Spring 1915, Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with Wright. Wright's first wife Catherine finally granted him a [[divorce]] in 1922,{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=271}} meaning that Wright could marry Noel a year later.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=279}} Although Wright admired Noel's erratic personality at first, her behavior (later identified as [[schizophrenia]]) led to a miserable life together at Taliesin.{{sfn|Huxtable|2004|loc=Chapter 7}} They married in November 1923, but Noel left Wright by the spring of 1924.{{sfn|Secrest|1992|p=280}}\n\nOn April 20, 1925, Wright returned from eating dinner in the detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright was able to get help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared.{{sfn|Wright|1943|pp=261\u2013262}} According to Wright's [[autobiography]], the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.{{sfn|Wright|1943|p=262}}\n\n==Taliesin III==\n[[Image:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Taliesin]]\nWright was deeply in debt following the destruction of Taliesin II. Aside from debts owed on the property, his divorce from Noel forced Wright to sell much of his farm machinery and livestock. Wright was also forced to sell his prized Japanese prints at half value to pay his debts. The [[Bank of Wisconsin]] [[foreclosure|foreclosed]] on Taliesin in 1927 and Wright was forced to move to [[La Jolla, California]]. \n\nShortly before the bank was to begin an auction on the property, Wright's former client Darwin Martin conceived a scheme to save the property. He formed a company called Frank Lloyd Wright Incorporated to issue stock on Wright's future earnings. Many of Wright's former clients and students purchased stock in Wright to raise $70,000. The company successfully bid on Taliesin for $40,000, returning it to Wright.\n\n[[File:TaliesinWest03 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|Starting in 1937, Wright wintered at [[Taliesin West]] in [[Arizona]].]]\nWright returned to Taliesin in the winter of 1928 and began to rebuild the complex, which he named Taliesin III, shortly afterward. Wright's interaction with Taliesin lasted for the rest of his life, and eventually, he purchased the surrounding land, creating an estate of 593 acres (2.4&nbsp;km\u00b2).{{sfn|Hoppen|1997|pp=59\u201360}} \n\nSome of Wright's best-known buildings and most ambitious designs were created at Taliesin III.

In 1928, Wright conceived the idea of hosting a school there and issued a proposal to the [[University of Wisconsin]] that would have created the Hillside Home School for the Allied Arts; however, the plan was later abandoned.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2001|p=9}} In 1932, the Wrights instead established the private Taliesin Fellowship, where fifty to sixty apprentices could come to Taliesin to study under the architect's mentorship. Students helped him develop the estate at a time when Wright received few commissions for his work. So, the architect had his apprentices work on the Hillside Home School building, renovating the original school gymnasium into a theater, and construct a drafting studio and dormitories. In 1937, Wright designed and the apprentices began construction on a winter home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]], which became known as [[Taliesin West]].
