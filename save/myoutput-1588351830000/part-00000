He has a son, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]], with ex-girlfriend [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Shannon Keene|Shannon Keene]], but he abandoned them both the day Robby was born after Johnny's mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Laura|Laura]] died the same day. Johnny, self-admittedly, has never recovered from the breakup with his high school girlfriend, [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]].\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor [[Miguel Diaz (character)|Miguel Diaz]] from a gang of bullies using [[karate]]. Miguel, an [[asthmatic]] raised by his [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]] single mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen]], asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate [[dojo]] as a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with [[Daniel LaRusso]]. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership, is married to [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda]] and has two children: [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha]] and [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Anthony LaRusso|Anthony]]. Finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda, but after his friend and mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] passed away, his struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille]], his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]] and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by [[John Kreese]]. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries very hard to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] who is Sam's rival.\n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n\n===Main===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Xolo Maridue\u00f1a]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Miguel Diaz|Miguel Diaz]]\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda LaRusso]]\n* [[Tanner Buchanan]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]]\n* [[Mary Mouser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha LaRusso]]\n* [[Jacob Bertrand]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Eli Moskowitz/Hawk|Eli Moskowitz/Hawk]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* Gianni Decenzo as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Demetri|Demetri]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] (guest season 1, main season 2)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Nichole Brown as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Aisha Robinson|Aisha Robinson]]\n* Vanessa Rubio as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen Diaz]]\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] (season 2)\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Raymond/Stingray|Raymond AKA \"Stingray]]\" (season 2)\n* [[Aedin Mincks]] as Mitch (season 2)\n* Khalil Everage as Chris (season 2)\n* Rose Bianco as Rosa Diaz\n* Hannah Kepple as Moon\n* Griffin Santopietro as Anthony LaRusso\n* [[Bret Ernst]] as Louie LaRusso Jr. (season 1)\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Shannon Keene\n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[Ed Asner]] as  [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Sid Weinberg|Sid Weinberg]] (season 1)\n* [[Dan Ahdoot]] as Anoush Norouzi\n* Owen Morgan as Bert\n* Nathaniel Oh as Nathaniel (season 2)\n* Joe Seo as Kyler (season 1)\n* Annalisa Cochrane as Yasmine (season 1)\n* Bo Mitchell as Brucks (season 1)\n* Jonathan Mercedes as A.

Released from police custody, Johnny is visited by his wealthy stepfather Sid Weinberg, who gives Johnny a check before officially disowning him. Getting drunk, Johnny drives to the All Valley Sports Arena and relives his last encounter with his former sensei John Kreese, before his car is wrecked in a hit-and-run. Despite Johnny\u2019s protests, his car is towed to one of Daniel's dealerships for repairs. The next day, he goes to the dealership in an attempt to take the car back, only to run into Daniel. Johnny reluctantly accepts a free car repair from Daniel, who considers Johnny an old friend. While at the dealership, Johnny realizes that Daniel's daughter Samantha was one of the passengers in the hit-and-run. After Daniel says they're all better off without Cobra Kai, Johnny returns home and tells Miguel that he will be his sensei, and opens his own Cobra Kai dojo with the money from Sid.\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Strike First\n |DirectedBy      = Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg\n |WrittenBy       = Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Miguel begins his karate training with Johnny, who bullys him for his [[asthma]] and low self-esteem. The health department informs Johnny that the dojo needs a lot of work before he can officially teach students. Meanwhile, Daniel and his wife Amanda argue after Daniel scolds Samantha for inviting her friends over for a pool party without her parents' permission. Reconciling with Samantha, Daniel learns she is romantically interested in a boy named Kyler and offers to invite him to a family dinner. At school, Miguel befriends social outcasts Dimitri and Eli. During lunch, they talk about the rich girls Samantha hangs out with and discover that Kyler is one of the bullies who attacked Miguel. Johnny is informed that his son, Robby Keene, has been caught with drugs at school. During dinner, Daniel notices Kyler's bruises and learns he received his injuries from Johnny.

No mercy\" in his everyday life and gives him a skeleton costume (the same one Johnny wore in the first film) for the dance. Daniel embarrasses Samantha during the dance by finding her and Kyler alone in a suggestive scene. Later, Miguel overhears Kyler and his friends sexually objectifying Samantha. Remembering Johnny's teachings, Miguel attacks Kyler, but is overpowered and severely beaten by the bullies.

Johnny confronts Robby after learning he has been skipping school. When Johnny tells him not to throw his life away, Robby rejects him and points out that Johnny left him as a child and that Johnny's own life is wasted. After seeing a father happily sharing a milkshake with his young son, Johnny pleads for Carmen to let him continue Miguel's training, vowing not to fail him again.

When Kyler embarrasses Samantha, Miguel stands up for her and attacks him and his friends, defeating them all in an impressive display and gaining Samantha's respect. Robby decides to reconcile with his father, but sees Johnny acting in a fatherly way with Miguel and feels he has been replaced. Amanda notices the changes in Daniel's behavior since the reopening of Cobra Kai, leading Daniel to visit the grave of Mr. Miyagi to reflect and ask for wisdom. As Daniel prepares to drive away, he suddenly recalls the discussion with Miyagi after he gifted Daniel his yellow [[1941 Ford#1948|1948 Ford Super De Luxe convertible]] on his seventeenth birthday, that the lessons on maintaining balance didn't just apply to karate, but to one's entire life.<br />''Note'': This episode is dedicated in memory of [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]].\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Quiver\n |DirectedBy      = Josh Heald\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay |s=Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg |ex1=Joe Piarulli & Luan Thomas |ex1label=Story and teleplay by}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Daniel tries unsuccessfully to persuade Samantha to take up karate again.

Thanks to Miguel, Johnny is forced to remember his childhood as an outcast with an uncaring stepfather before he discovered Cobra Kai. Johnny admits that he has been tough and cruel to his remaining students, but refuses to apologize, telling them that life is not fair and they must overcome the challenges that life will throw at them. Eli returns to the dojo with a distinctive mohawk haircut, for which Johnny nicknames him \"Hawk\". Robby gets a job at LaRusso Auto to get back at his father, and Miguel and Samantha slowly become friends at school.

At a meeting of the athletic committee, Johnny tries to persuade them to reverse the ban, but is opposed by Daniel, a committee member. Johnny tells the committee that his teachings are different from those of Kreese and Silver, revealing that Kreese himself is dead. He says that he has learned from his past mistakes and that his dojo is now a place where people who get bullied are taught self confidence and how to stand up for themselves. The committee is convinced by Johnny's apparent sincerity and allows Cobra Kai to compete, infuriating Daniel.

Johnny later takes Miguel to eat hamburgers and fries, and confides in him that on the day Robby was born, he wasn't there for him because his mother (at the time the only person Johnny cared about) had passed away. Johnny was afraid of being a father and failed Robby on his first day. Johnny vows to never fail Miguel, and support him.

Kreese is making Cobra Kai be more ruthless, telling Tory to finish one dojomate. Miguel calls Kreese out on it, and Kreese says that mercy may be beneficial during a tournament, but in real life they must finish the fight in order to win. While talking to Tory, Tory reveals that her mother had to work as a waitress to support Tory and her brother, and her mom would take leftovers to feed them. Her mom's boss found out, and fired Tory's mom, which caused Tory to decide that since the world shows no mercy, she shouldn't either.

He has a son, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]], with ex-girlfriend [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Shannon Keene|Shannon Keene]], but he abandoned them both the day Robby was born after Johnny's mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Laura|Laura]] died the same day. Johnny, self-admittedly, has never recovered from the breakup with his high school girlfriend, [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]].\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor [[Miguel Diaz (character)|Miguel Diaz]] from a gang of bullies using [[karate]]. Miguel, an [[asthmatic]] raised by his [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]] single mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen]], asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate [[dojo]] as a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with [[Daniel LaRusso]]. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership, is married to [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda]] and has two children: [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha]] and [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Anthony LaRusso|Anthony]]. Finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda, but after his friend and mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] passed away, his struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille]], his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]] and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by [[John Kreese]]. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries very hard to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] who is Sam's rival.\n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n\n===Main===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Xolo Maridue\u00f1a]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Miguel Diaz|Miguel Diaz]]\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda LaRusso]]\n* [[Tanner Buchanan]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]]\n* [[Mary Mouser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha LaRusso]]\n* [[Jacob Bertrand]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Eli Moskowitz/Hawk|Eli Moskowitz/Hawk]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* Gianni Decenzo as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Demetri|Demetri]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] (guest season 1, main season 2)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Nichole Brown as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Aisha Robinson|Aisha Robinson]]\n* Vanessa Rubio as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen Diaz]]\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] (season 2)\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Raymond/Stingray|Raymond AKA \"Stingray]]\" (season 2)\n* [[Aedin Mincks]] as Mitch (season 2)\n* Khalil Everage as Chris (season 2)\n* Rose Bianco as Rosa Diaz\n* Hannah Kepple as Moon\n* Griffin Santopietro as Anthony LaRusso\n* [[Bret Ernst]] as Louie LaRusso Jr. (season 1)\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Shannon Keene\n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[Ed Asner]] as  [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Sid Weinberg|Sid Weinberg]] (season 1)\n* [[Dan Ahdoot]] as Anoush Norouzi\n* Owen Morgan as Bert\n* Nathaniel Oh as Nathaniel (season 2)\n* Joe Seo as Kyler (season 1)\n* Annalisa Cochrane as Yasmine (season 1)\n* Bo Mitchell as Brucks (season 1)\n* Jonathan Mercedes as A.

Released from police custody, Johnny is visited by his wealthy stepfather Sid Weinberg, who gives Johnny a check before officially disowning him. Getting drunk, Johnny drives to the All Valley Sports Arena and relives his last encounter with his former sensei John Kreese, before his car is wrecked in a hit-and-run. Despite Johnny\u2019s protests, his car is towed to one of Daniel's dealerships for repairs. The next day, he goes to the dealership in an attempt to take the car back, only to run into Daniel. Johnny reluctantly accepts a free car repair from Daniel, who considers Johnny an old friend. While at the dealership, Johnny realizes that Daniel's daughter Samantha was one of the passengers in the hit-and-run. After Daniel says they're all better off without Cobra Kai, Johnny returns home and tells Miguel that he will be his sensei, and opens his own Cobra Kai dojo with the money from Sid.\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Strike First\n |DirectedBy      = Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg\n |WrittenBy       = Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Miguel begins his karate training with Johnny, who bullys him for his [[asthma]] and low self-esteem.

Reconciling with Samantha, Daniel learns she is romantically interested in a boy named Kyler and offers to invite him to a family dinner. At school, Miguel befriends social outcasts Dimitri and Eli. During lunch, they talk about the rich girls Samantha hangs out with and discover that Kyler is one of the bullies who attacked Miguel. Johnny is informed that his son, Robby Keene, has been caught with drugs at school. During dinner, Daniel notices Kyler's bruises and learns he received his injuries from Johnny.

Daniel embarrasses Samantha during the dance by finding her and Kyler alone in a suggestive scene. Later, Miguel overhears Kyler and his friends sexually objectifying Samantha. Remembering Johnny's teachings, Miguel attacks Kyler, but is overpowered and severely beaten by the bullies.

Johnny confronts Robby after learning he has been skipping school. When Johnny tells him not to throw his life away, Robby rejects him and points out that Johnny left him as a child and that Johnny's own life is wasted. After seeing a father happily sharing a milkshake with his young son, Johnny pleads for Carmen to let him continue Miguel's training, vowing not to fail him again.

When Kyler embarrasses Samantha, Miguel stands up for her and attacks him and his friends, defeating them all in an impressive display and gaining Samantha's respect. Robby decides to reconcile with his father, but sees Johnny acting in a fatherly way with Miguel and feels he has been replaced. Amanda notices the changes in Daniel's behavior since the reopening of Cobra Kai, leading Daniel to visit the grave of Mr. Miyagi to reflect and ask for wisdom. As Daniel prepares to drive away, he suddenly recalls the discussion with Miyagi after he gifted Daniel his yellow [[1941 Ford#1948|1948 Ford Super De Luxe convertible]] on his seventeenth birthday, that the lessons on maintaining balance didn't just apply to karate, but to one's entire life.<br />''Note'': This episode is dedicated in memory of [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]].\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Quiver\n |DirectedBy      = Josh Heald\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay |s=Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg |ex1=Joe Piarulli & Luan Thomas |ex1label=Story and teleplay by}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Daniel tries unsuccessfully to persuade Samantha to take up karate again.

Thanks to Miguel, Johnny is forced to remember his childhood as an outcast with an uncaring stepfather before he discovered Cobra Kai. Johnny admits that he has been tough and cruel to his remaining students, but refuses to apologize, telling them that life is not fair and they must overcome the challenges that life will throw at them. Eli returns to the dojo with a distinctive mohawk haircut, for which Johnny nicknames him \"Hawk\". Robby gets a job at LaRusso Auto to get back at his father, and Miguel and Samantha slowly become friends at school.

At a meeting of the athletic committee, Johnny tries to persuade them to reverse the ban, but is opposed by Daniel, a committee member. Johnny tells the committee that his teachings are different from those of Kreese and Silver, revealing that Kreese himself is dead.
