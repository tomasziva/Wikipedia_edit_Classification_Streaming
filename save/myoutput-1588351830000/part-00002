The few alleged [[ink]] inscriptions showing his name are drawn very sloppily, and the reading and thus whole existence of king \"Crocodile\" are highly disputed. His tomb is unknown.\n\n== Name sources ==\nThe proposed existence of Crocodile is based on [[G\u00fcnter Dreyer]]'s and [[Edwin van den Brink]]'s essays. They are convinced that Crocodile was a local king who ruled at the region of [[Tarkhan (Egypt)|Tarkhan]]. According to Dreyer, Crocodile's name appears in black ink inscriptions on burnt earthen jars and on several seal impressions found in tomb ''TT 1549'' at Tarkhan and tomb ''B-414'' at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. He sees a crawling crocodile and a rope curl beneath it and reads ''Shendjw'' (\"the subduer\").<ref name=\"G\u00fcnter Dreyer 1992, p. 259-263\"/> Van den Brink thinks alike and reads ''Shendjw'', too, but sees only a large rope curl sign inside the ''serekh''.<ref name=EVB>Edwin van den Brink: ''The Nile Delta in Transition - from 4th - 3rd Millennium BC''. Institute of Archaeology and Arabic Studies, Tel Aviv 1992, p. 28 - 35.</ref>\n\n== Reign and datation ==\nAlmost nothing is known about Crocodile's reign. If he existed, he might have had his capital at Tarkhan, where his proposed tomb was excavated. Dreyer places him in a time shortly before the kings [[Iry-Hor]], [[Ka (pharaoh)|Ka]] and [[Narmer]]. He points to guiding inscriptions on the jars mentioning a ''Hen-mehw'' (\"brought from Lower Egypt\"). This specific diction of designations of origin is archaeologically proven for the time before three mentioned kings, from King Ka onward, it was ''Inj-mehw'' (with the same meaning).<ref name=\"G\u00fcnter Dreyer 1992, p. 259-263\"/>\n\nOne interesting artifact that possibly depicts King Crocodile, was found at [[Hierakonpolis]] in the so-called ''Main deposit''. The artifact is a piece of a broken mace head which shows traces of a once completed relief scene. The conserved part of the relief shows the head and upper torso of a seated king figure inside a [[Sed festival|''hebsed'']]-pavillon. It wears the Red Crown of Upper Egypt, a hebsed cloak and a flail. Right before the face of the king traces of a golden rosette (the predynastic crest of the kings) and a certain hieroglyph are visible. Unfortunately, all but the hieroglyph are damaged, leaving room for interpretations. Mainstream Egyptologists consider the sign to be either the name of Crocodile or King [[Scorpion II]].<ref>Barbara Adams: ''Ancient Hierakonpolis''.

Right of this crest a divine standard is depicted, a recumbent crocodile with two projectings (either [[Nymphaea lotus|lotus]] buds<ref name=\"G\u00fcnter Dreyer 1992, p. 259-263\"/> or ostrich feathers<ref>Toby A.H.

The whole arrangement is surrounded by rows of crocodiles with rope curls beneath, which seems to point to the proposed reading of Crocodile's royal serekh. But Egyptologists Van den Brink and [[Ludwig David Morenz]] argue against the idea that the seal impression talks about the ruler. In their opinion, the inscription celebrates the foundation of a shrine for the god [[Sobek]] at a city named ''Shedyt'' (alternatively ''Shedet'').<ref name=EVB/> The city and the shrine are known from [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] inscriptions, the main cult centre was located at [[Medinet el-Fayum]].
