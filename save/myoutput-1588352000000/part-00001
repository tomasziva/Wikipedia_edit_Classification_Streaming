{"title_page": "Maze Prison escape", "text_new": "{{Campaignbox Northern Ireland Troubles}}\nThe '''Maze Prison escape''' (known to [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] as the '''Great Escape''') took place on 25 September 1983 in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]]. [[HM Prison Maze]] (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered to be one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during [[the Troubles]]. In the biggest [[prison escape]] in UK history, 38 [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a [[heart attack]] during the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British [[government minister]] faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the prison.\n\n==Previous IRA escapes==\n[[File:Escape from HM Prison Maze, 1974 (4 of 9) (37696549914).jpg|thumb|RUC archive image (via the [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]]) taken following the November 1974 tunnel escape attempt]]\nIRA [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteers]] regarded themselves as [[prisoners of war]] with a duty to escape.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Dillon |title=Killer in Clowntown: Joe Doherty, the IRA and the Special Relationship |publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] |year=1992 |doi= |isbn=0-09-175306-6 |page=124}}</ref> During [[the Troubles]], [[Irish republican]] prisoners had escaped from custody ''en masse'' on several occasions.

A dozen prisoners also took uniforms from the officers, and the officers were also forced to hand over their car keys and details of where their cars were, for possible later use during the escape.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> A rearguard was left behind to watch over hostages and keep the alarm from being raised until they believed the escapees were clear of the prison, when they returned to their cells.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At 3:25 pm, a lorry delivering food supplies arrived at the entrance to H7, whereupon [[Brendan McFarlane]] and other prisoners took the occupants hostage at gunpoint and moved them inside H7. The lorry driver was told the lorry was being used in the escape, and he was instructed what route to take and how to react if challenged.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> Storey told the driver, \"This man [Gerry Kelly] is doing 30 years and he will shoot you without hesitation if he has to. He has nothing to lose.\"<ref name=\"ind\"/>\n\nAt 3:50 pm the prisoners left H7, and the driver and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the [[clutch]]. 37 prisoners climbed into the back of the lorry, while Gerry Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been [[booby trap]]ped with a [[hand grenade]].<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners intended to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/>\n\n[[File:Maze Prison escape.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[HM Prison Maze]] showing the escape route]]\nFinucane continued to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers who had just entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the [[British Army]] operations room that he had seen prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage out of the room and telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since [[World War II]].<ref name=\"time\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=O'Day|first=Alan|title=Political Violence in Northern Ireland: Conflict and Conflict Resolution|publisher=Praeger Publishers|date=1997|page=88|isbn=978-0-275-95414-7}}</ref>\n\nOutside the prison the IRA had planned a logistical support operation involving 100 armed members,<ref>{{cite book|last=McKevoy|first=Kieran|title=Paramilitary Imprisonment in Northern Ireland: Resistance, Management and Release|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/paramilitaryimpr0000mcev/page/68 68]|isbn=978-0-19-829907-3|url=https://archive.org/details/paramilitaryimpr0000mcev/page/68}}</ref> but due to a miscalculation of five minutes, the prisoners found no transport waiting for them and were forced to flee across fields or hijack vehicles.<ref name=\"ind\"/><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news|title=1983: Dozens escape in Maze break-out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/25/newsid_2538000/2538295.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=25 September 1983|accessdate=29 August 2007}}</ref> The British Army and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] immediately activated a contingency plan and by 4:25 pm a cordon of vehicle check points were in place around the prison, and others were later in place in strategic positions across Northern Ireland, resulting in the recapture of one prisoner at 11:00 pm.

In the biggest [[prison escape]] in UK history, 38 [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a [[heart attack]] during the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British [[government minister]] faced calls to resign.

Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane.

This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the [[British Army]] operations room that he had seen prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage out of the room and telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter.<ref name=\"hennessy\"/> The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since [[World War II]].<ref name=\"time\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=O'Day|first=Alan|title=Political Violence in Northern Ireland: Conflict and Conflict Resolution|publisher=Praeger Publishers|date=1997|page=88|isbn=978-0-275-95414-7}}</ref>\n\nOutside the prison the IRA had planned a logistical support operation involving 100 armed members,<ref>{{cite book|last=McKevoy|first=Kieran|title=Paramilitary Imprisonment in Northern Ireland: Resistance, Management and Release|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/paramilitaryimpr0000mcev/page/68 68]|isbn=978-0-19-829907-3|url=https://archive.org/details/paramilitaryimpr0000mcev/page/68}}</ref> but due to a miscalculation of five minutes, the prisoners found no transport waiting for them and were forced to flee across fields or hijack vehicles.<ref name=\"ind\"/><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news|title=1983: Dozens escape in Maze break-out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/25/newsid_2538000/2538295.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=25 September 1983|accessdate=29 August 2007}}</ref> The British Army and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] immediately activated a contingency plan and by 4:25 pm a cordon of vehicle check points were in place around the prison, and others were later in place in strategic positions across Northern Ireland, resulting in the recapture of one prisoner at 11:00 pm.
