On 10 March<ref name=hill/> the French expedition, having taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again. Phillip and La P\u00e9rouse never met. La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30-acre grant at Rose Hill, near [[Parramatta]], was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Farms|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/agriculture/life/farms/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\n\n[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804]]\nIn 1804 the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the [[New South Wales Corps]]. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor [[William Bligh|Bligh]] led by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]. Following this, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n* '''13 May 1787''' \u2013 The 11 ships of the [[First Fleet]] leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. Different accounts give varying numbers of passengers but the fleet consisted of at least 1,350 persons of whom 780 were convicts and 570 were free men, women and children and the number included four companies of marines. About 20% of the convicts were women and the oldest convict was 82. About 50% of the convicts had been tried in Middlesex and most of the rest were tried in the county assizes of Devon, Kent and Sussex\n* '''18 January 1788''' \u2013 The First Fleet arrived in [[Botany Bay]] but the landing party was not impressed with the site, and moved the fleet to [[Port Jackson]], landing in [[Sydney Cove]] on 26 January 1788 (now celebrated as [[Australia Day]]).\n* ''' April 1789''' \u2013 an outbreak of smallpox decimates local tribes.\n* '''1790''' \u2013 the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] of convicts arrives in Sydney Cove.\n* '''1791''' \u2013 [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] of convicts arrives\n* '''1793''' \u2013 January: the first free settlers arrive in NSW.\n* '''1793''' \u2013 March\u2013April: visit of the expedition led by [[Alessandro Malaspina]].\n* '''1825''' - May: Founding of [[Brisbane]]\n* '''14 June 1825''' \u2013 the colony of [[Van Diemen's Land]] is established in its own right; its name is officially changed to [[Tasmania]] on 1 January 1856. The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

In 1842 it became a crown colony and on 22 July 1861 its area was extended westwards to its present boundary and more area was taken from New South Wales. South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England. Many ex-convicts and convicts on tickets of leave and conditional pardons also moved to Port Phillip from Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''10 December 1859''' \u2013 [[Queensland]] is [[Separation of Queensland|separated from New South Wales]]. In 1824 the explorer Lt. [[John Oxley]] took a party of 30 convicts and established a penal colony at Redcliffe. Known as the Moreton Bay Settlement, this later moved to the site now called Brisbane. The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 and 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337. The first free settlers moved to the district in 1838 and others followed in 1840.\n* '''23 December 1862''' \u2013 the area of Queensland is increased.\n* '''1863''' \u2013 control of the [[Northern Territory]] is granted to the Province (later State) of South Australia.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.<ref name=\"moadoph.gov.au\"/>\n\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the [[Governor of New South Wales]]. [[William Wentworth]] established the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. The reformist [[Attorney General of New South Wales|attorney general]], [[John Plunkett]], sought to apply [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to [[emancipist]]s, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]. Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of Aboriginal people with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark ''Church Act'' of 1836 [[State religion|disestablished]] the [[Church of England]] and established legal equality between [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglicans]], [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholics]], Presbyterians and later Methodists.<ref name=adb>{{cite book | first=T.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the ''[[Treaty of Waitangi]]'' was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with the [[Eora]] people of Sydney Cove, nor any of the other Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Very Short History of the World]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been [[History wars|highly controversial]]. According to Australian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to describe their presence and relations with Aboriginal Australians. In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded.

La P\u00e9rouse is remembered in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|a Sydney suburb]] of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this voyage.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers\u2014most notably [[Watkin Tench]]\u2014left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney\u2014many \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=Arthur%3BPhillip Biography \u2013 Arthur Phillip \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography].

This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition led by [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\".<ref>David Collins, ''An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales,'' London, Vol.I, 1798, p.502</ref>\n\n===Convicts and free settlers===\nWhen the ''Bellona'' transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS ''Sirius''; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the ''Sirius''), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the ''Juliana'' transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the [[Irish republicanism|political]] and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting\u2014few of the first-wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[[File:Poster australia NZ 1788 1911 shepherd 1923.png|thumb|right|A historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788\u20131911]]\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [[penal servitude]], or \"for the term of their natural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anne Summers |title=Damned Whores and God's Police |year=1975 |location=[[Ringwood, Victoria|Ringwood]], Victoria |isbn=978-0-14-021832-9 |pages= 270\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] or the [[Parramatta Female Factory]].\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Moreton Bay]], for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at [[Norfolk Island]] was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [[James Ruse]] produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30-acre grant at Rose Hill, near [[Parramatta]], was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Farms|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/agriculture/life/farms/index.html|work=Discover Collections|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\n\n[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804]]\nIn 1804 the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the [[New South Wales Corps]]. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor [[William Bligh|Bligh]] led by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]. Following this, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n* '''13 May 1787''' \u2013 The 11 ships of the [[First Fleet]] leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]].

The first settlement was made at [[Risdon, Tasmania]] on 11 September 1803 when Lt. John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lt.-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [[Hobart]] in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803\u20131853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The ''Indefatigable'' brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [[Norfolk Island]] and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n* '''21 January 1827''' \u2013 Western Australia was created when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) by Major Edmund Lockyer in order to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed, with [[Captain James Stirling]] as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony aboard 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the ''Hougoumont'' brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n* '''1835''' \u2013 the ''Proclamation of Governor Bourke'', issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no-one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [[John Batman]]). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.<ref>[http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/bourketerra/ Governor Bourke\u2019s 1835 Proclamation of Terra Nullius | Australia's migration history timeline | NSW Migration Heritage Centre].

South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836 and 1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. Twenty-four thousand and nine hundred more arrived between 1841 and 1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31749645 |title=Proclamation |newspaper=[[South Australian Register|South Australian Gazette And Colonial Register]] |location=South Australia |date=3 June 1837 |access-date=19 March 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove}}</ref>\n* '''1841''' \u2013 [[New Zealand]] is separated from New South Wales\n* '''1851''' \u2013 [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844 and 1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England.

The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824 and 1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337.

One was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], whose son, [[William Wentworth|William Charles]], went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]], a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the [[Rum Rebellion]] against the governor, [[William Bligh]].\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free [[The Crown|Crown]] land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the [[Nineteen Counties]].\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class, the [[Squattocracy]]. As a result of opposition from the [[working class|labour]]ing and [[artisan]] classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (first settled in 1803, later renamed [[Tasmania]]) and [[Moreton Bay]] (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [[Swan River Colony|Swan River Settlement]] (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) [[New Zealand]] was part of [[New South Wales]] until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]], appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The [[New South Wales Corps]], which was in charge of [[New South Wales]], became known as the \"Rum Corps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [[rum]], which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \"[[Rum Rebellion]]\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists.

Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [[Myall Creek massacre]] of Aboriginal people with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark ''Church Act'' of 1836 [[State religion|disestablished]] the [[Church of England]] and established legal equality between [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglicans]], [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholics]], Presbyterians and later Methodists.<ref name=adb>{{cite book | first=T.

European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the ''[[Treaty of Waitangi]]'' was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with the [[Eora]] people of Sydney Cove, nor any of the other Aboriginal peoples in Australia.\n\nAccording to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Very Short History of the World]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-300559-9}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been [[History wars|highly controversial]]. According to Australian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to describe their presence and relations with Aboriginal Australians. In his book ''[[The Other Side of the Frontier]]'',<ref>Reynolds, Henry, ''The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal resistance to the European invasion of Australia'', 1981, {{ISBN|0-86840-892-1}}</ref> Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\n\n[[File:Yagan Statue 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Yagan]] on [[Heirisson Island]]]]\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of the local Aboriginal people:\n\n<blockquote>While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.<ref>quoted in {{harvp|Reynolds|1999|p=165}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, [[Western Australia]]n barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [[Julius Caesar]] did when he [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|took possession of Britain]].\"<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=163}}</ref> In most cases, Reynolds says, Aboriginal people initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the ''Launceston Advertiser'' in 1831, a settler wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies\u2014as invaders\u2014as oppressors and persecutors\u2014they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|p=148}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aboriginal people determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of ''[[The Queenslander]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.<ref>{{harv|Reynolds|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the myth of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.<ref>{{harvp|Reynolds|1999|loc=Chapter 9: \"The Killing Times\", pp. 117\u2013133}}</ref> Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the [[Pinjarra massacre]], the [[Myall Creek massacre]], and the [[Rufus River massacre]].\n\nFamous Aboriginal men who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include [[Pemulwuy]] and [[Yagan]], and many others went unrecorded.
