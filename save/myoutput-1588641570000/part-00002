Here, they attended the Swayamwara of [[Draupadi]], who was the princess of Panchala and the daughter of King [[Drupada]]. [[Arjuna]], the younger brother of Yudhishthira, participated in her swayamwara and succeeded in winning her hand in marriage. After the swayamvara, [[Arjuna]] along with his brothers, treaded towards the hut where their mother [[Kunti]] was waiting for them. As soon as they reached the hut, [[Arjuna]] called his mother in delight and said, \"Look what we have got as alms\". Kunti who was praying at that moment, without looking what exactly it was, commanded \"Whatever [[Arjuna]] has received as alms should be equally distributed amongst the five brothers.\" Hence Draupadi was married off to all the five brothers, making her the common wife of the [[Pandavas]].\n\nVyasa Mahabharata mention Devika only in Adi Parva in the list of Kuru wives.

He lost his kingdom, his brothers and [[Draupadi]].

Hearing that from the righteous Yudhishthira, Drona dropped his guard and started meditating for death in the middle of battle. Pandava's Commander-in-Chief Dhristadyumna took Drona's sword and killed Drona immediately. This changed the tide of the war totally. Until that moment, any chariot with Yudhishthira always had its wheels hovering 2 inches above ground surface. But immediately after death of Drona, Yudhishthira lost the merit of total truth, and his chariot dropped to the ground. \n\nYudhishthira had to bend numerous rules of Dharma during the course of the war. Yudhishthira also had to slay a number of warriors, including his own uncle, [[Shalya]] in a spear fight and his another uncle, Shalya's younger brother he killed them both on the 18th day of the war when Shalya was the commander-in-chief.\n\n==Retirement and Ascent To Heaven==\n\n[[File:Yudhisthira with a dog as a chariot from heaven arrive.jpg|thumb|Yudhishthira and His Dog, Ascending]]\n\nAfter the war, Yudhisthira was crowned as the Emperor of [[Hastinapura]] for 36 years. He performed [[Ashwamedha]] Yagya on [[Krishna]]'s insistence and established Bharat Varsh as one country under his rule. Upon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's grandson, [[Parikshit]]. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]]. Among the Pandavas and Draupadi, one-by-one died on the way to reach the top, starting from Draupadi. Finally, it was Yudhisthira who was able to reach the top, with the dog accompanying him.\n\n===Dog Test===\n\nOn reaching the top, [[Indra]] asked him to abandon the dog before entering the Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog's unflinching loyalty as a reason. Indra said he let his family die, but Yudhishthira said he could not prevent their deaths, but to abandon a poor creature was a great sin. It turned out that the dog was his god-father Dharma Devatha in disguise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Agarwal|first=Satya P.|title=Selections from the Mahabharata : re-affirming Gita's call for the god of all|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120818743|edition=1.

Instead, he only saw Duryodhana and his allies. The Gods told him that his brothers were in [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (one of the vedic hells), atoning for their sins.\n\nYudhishthira loyally went to Naraka to meet his brothers, but the sight of gore and blood horrified him. After hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery, he remained. Yudhishthira ordered the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in a heaven with his enemies. Eventually this turned out to be another illusion to test him and also to enable him to atone for his sin of deceiving his guru during the war where he half-lied to [[Drona]] about [[Ashwatthama]]'s death. Thereafter, [[Indra]] and Krishna appeared before him and told him that his brothers (including [[Karna]]) were already in heaven but so were his enemies.\n\n===Yudhishthira's Curse===\n\nAfter he was made aware that [[Karna]] was his elder brother, Yudhishthira cursed all women with not being able to hide any secrets. Had Yudhishthira's mother [[Kunti]] not kept that fact a secret, the war might have been averted, with millions spared.<ref>{{cite book|last=transl.|title=Book 11.

His chariot always flew at a 4 finger distance above the ground due to his piety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mittal|first=J.P.|title=History of ancient India : a new version|year=2006|publisher=Atlantic|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788126906161|pages=477}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and Children==\n\nYudhishthira had two wives, [[Draupadi]] and Devika<ref>{{cite web |title=Pandava : Apart from Draupadi, Yudhishthira had one more wife Devika |url=https://www.newstrend.news/183260/draupadi-yudhishter-bheem-arjun-patniyan/ |website=newstrend.news |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAfter the Lakshyagriha episode, the [[Pandavas]] disguised as Brahmins went to the kingdom of [[Panchala]]. Here, they attended the Swayamwara of [[Draupadi]], who was the princess of Panchala and the daughter of King [[Drupada]]. [[Arjuna]], the younger brother of Yudhishthira, participated in her swayamwara and succeeded in winning her hand in marriage. After the swayamvara, [[Arjuna]] along with his brothers, treaded towards the hut where their mother [[Kunti]] was waiting for them. As soon as they reached the hut, [[Arjuna]] called his mother in delight and said, \"Look what we have got as alms\". Kunti who was praying at that moment, without looking what exactly it was, commanded \"Whatever [[Arjuna]] has received as alms should be equally distributed amongst the five brothers.\" Hence Draupadi was married off to all the five brothers, making her the common wife of the [[Pandavas]].\n\nVyasa Mahabharata mention Devika only in Adi Parva in the list of Kuru wives. Very little is known of her, except that she was daughter of Govasana from Shivi tribe, and was married to Yudhisthira in a self-choice ceremony. <ref>https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01096.htm </ref>\n[[File:MayaSabha.jpg|thumb|MayaSabha]]\n\n==Indraprastha==\n\n===Performing The Rajasuya===\n\n[[File:King Yudhisthira Performs the Rajasuya Sacrifice.png|thumb|left|300px|King Yudhishthira Performs the Rajasuya Sacrifice]]\n\nAfter the coronation at Indraprastha, Yudhishthira set out to perform the [[Rajasuya]] yagna.\n\n[[Arjuna]], [[Bhima]], [[Nakula]], and [[Sahadeva]] led armies across the four corners of the world to obtain tributes from all kingdoms for Yudhishthira's sacrifice. The non-compliant [[Magadha]] king, [[Jarasandha]] was defeated by [[Bhima]] and Krishna. At his sacrifice, Yudhishthira chose Krishna as his honoured guest.\n\n==Losing Kingdom and Exile==\n\nYudhishthira succumbed to [[Shakuni]]'s challenge in the [[Pachisi]] (game of dice). He lost his kingdom, his brothers and [[Draupadi]]. While playing for second time, he lost all his kingdom in the game and was forced into exile for 13 years, which included one year in anonymity.\n\n{{main|Yaksha Prashna}}\n[[File:Yudhisthira answer to yaksha.jpg|thumb|250px|Yudhisthira answering the questions of Yaksha]]\n\nDuring their exile, the four other Pandavas happened upon a lake, which was haunted by a [[Yaksha]]. The Yaksha challenged the brothers to answer his moral questions before drinking the water; the four Pandavas laughed and drank the water anyway. As a result, they choked on the water and died. Yudhishthira went in last, answered many questions put forth to him by the Yaksha and revived his brothers. This story is often cited as an example of Yudhishthira's upright principles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|year=1999|publisher=Sarup & Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788176250641|edition=1st}}</ref> The Yaksha later identified himself as Yudhishthira's father, Dharma and pointed them to the kingdom of [[Matsya]] to spend their last year in exile anonymously.\n\nAlong with his brothers, Yudhishthira spent his last year of exile in the kingdom of Matsya. He disguised himself as a [[Brahmin]] named Kank (among themselves Pandavas called him Jaya) and taught the game of dice to the king.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishore|first=B.

Yudhishthira made numerous diplomatic efforts to retrieve his kingdom peacefully but in vain. He was convinced by Krishna to wage war.\n\nThe flag of Yudhishthira's chariot bore the image of a golden Moon with planets around it. Two large and beautiful kettle-drums, called Nanda and Upananda, were tied to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/dutt/maha09.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07023.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Kapoor |editor-first=Subodh |title=The Indian encyclopaedia : biographical, historical, religious, administrative, ethnological, commercial and scientific|year=2002|publisher=Cosmo Publications |location=New Delhi |isbn=9788177552713 |pages=4462 |edition=1st}}</ref> Before the war started, Yudhisthira stepped down from his chariot to take blessings firm his grand sire [[Bhishma]], teachers [[Drona]] and [[Kripa]] and uncle [[Shalya]], who all were in his opposite side in the war showing his respect towards his elders.\n\n[[File:Sadiq, bhima uccide l'elefante asvatthama, india del nord, periodo mogul, 1598.jpg |thumb|Death of [[Drona]]]]\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the war, [[Bhima]] killed elephant [[Ashwathama]] and Yudhisthira shouted to [[Drona]] about death of a battle elephant named same as [[Drona]]'s son [[Ashwathama]]. Hearing that from the righteous Yudhishthira, Drona dropped his guard and started meditating for death in the middle of battle. Pandava's Commander-in-Chief Dhristadyumna took Drona's sword and killed Drona immediately. This changed the tide of the war totally. Until that moment, any chariot with Yudhishthira always had its wheels hovering 2 inches above ground surface. But immediately after death of Drona, Yudhishthira lost the merit of total truth, and his chariot dropped to the ground. \n\nYudhishthira had to bend numerous rules of Dharma during the course of the war. Yudhishthira also had to slay a number of warriors, including his own uncle, [[Shalya]] in a spear fight and his another uncle, Shalya's younger brother he killed them both on the 18th day of the war when Shalya was the commander-in-chief.\n\n==Retirement and Ascent To Heaven==\n\n[[File:Yudhisthira with a dog as a chariot from heaven arrive.jpg|thumb|Yudhishthira and His Dog, Ascending]]\n\nAfter the war, Yudhisthira was crowned as the Emperor of [[Hastinapura]] for 36 years. He performed [[Ashwamedha]] Yagya on [[Krishna]]'s insistence and established Bharat Varsh as one country under his rule. Upon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's grandson, [[Parikshit]]. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]]. Among the Pandavas and Draupadi, one-by-one died on the way to reach the top, starting from Draupadi. Finally, it was Yudhisthira who was able to reach the top, with the dog accompanying him.\n\n===Dog Test===\n\nOn reaching the top, [[Indra]] asked him to abandon the dog before entering the Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog's unflinching loyalty as a reason. Indra said he let his family die, but Yudhishthira said he could not prevent their deaths, but to abandon a poor creature was a great sin. It turned out that the dog was his god-father Dharma Devatha in disguise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Agarwal|first=Satya P.|title=Selections from the Mahabharata : re-affirming Gita's call for the god of all|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120818743|edition=1. Aufl.}}</ref>\n\n===Test of Patience in Hell===\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nUpon reaching heaven, Yudhishthira did not find either his virtuous brothers or his wife Draupadi. Instead, he only saw Duryodhana and his allies. The Gods told him that his brothers were in [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (one of the vedic hells), atoning for their sins.\n\nYudhishthira loyally went to Naraka to meet his brothers, but the sight of gore and blood horrified him. After hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery, he remained. Yudhishthira ordered the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in a heaven with his enemies. Eventually this turned out to be another illusion to test him and also to enable him to atone for his sin of deceiving his guru during the war where he half-lied to [[Drona]] about [[Ashwatthama]]'s death. Thereafter, [[Indra]] and Krishna appeared before him and told him that his brothers (including [[Karna]]) were already in heaven but so were his enemies.\n\n===Yudhishthira's Curse===\n\nAfter he was made aware that [[Karna]] was his elder brother, Yudhishthira cursed all women with not being able to hide any secrets. Had Yudhishthira's mother [[Kunti]] not kept that fact a secret, the war might have been averted, with millions spared.<ref>{{cite book|last=transl.|title=Book 11.

I do not so much dread Arjuna or [[Bhima]] or Krishna or the twin brothers as I dread the wrath of the king, O [[S\u016bta|Suta]], when his wrath is excited. His austerities are great; he is devoted to ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' practices. His heart's wishes will certainly be fulfilled.

(Mahabharata Sabha Parva Section 77).\n\n==In the Media==\n\nBeing a character in Indian [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] and an important person in ''[[Mahabharata]]'', this role has been enacted by various actors over the years. Two most famous actors to have played this role are [[Gajendra Chauhan]] in the 1988 television series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'', and [[Rohit Bharadwaj]] in the 2013 series ''[[Mahabharat (2013 TV series)|Mahabharat]]''. Both were offered the role of Lord Krishna first and then Yudhishthira. [[Manoj Bajpayee]] has also voiced the character in the animated ''[[Mahabharat (2013 film)|Mahabharat]]''. In 2015 series [[Suryaputra Karn]], [[Kanan Malhotra]] played the role.\nThere is a red dragon in the [[Iron Realms Entertainment]] game ''[[Aetolia, The Midnight Age]]'' named Yudhishthira.\n\n==Citations==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mahabharataonline.com/ Persons and stories from ''Mahabharata'']\n\n{{Mahabharata}}\n{{HinduMythology}}\n{{Commons category|Yudhisthira}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in the Mahabharata]]\n[[Category:Entering heaven alive]]\n", "name_user": "AlanM1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn the Media:\u2192\u2192\u200eIn the media:Section titles should be presented in sentence case perMOS:SECTIONS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira"}
