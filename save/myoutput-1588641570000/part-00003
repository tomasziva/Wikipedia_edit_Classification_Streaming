The revolution led to the establishment of a parliament, the [[National Consultative Assembly]] (also known as the Majlis), and approval of the first constitution. Although the constitutional revolution was successful in weakening the autocracy of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] regime, it failed to provide a powerful alternative government. Therefore, in the decades following the establishment of the new parliament, a number of critical events took place. Many of these events can be viewed as a continuation of the struggle between the constitutionalists and the Shahs of Persia, many of whom were backed by foreign powers against the parliament.\n\n=== Reza Shah ===\n{{Main|Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h}}\nInsecurity and chaos created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan, the commander of the elite Persian Cossack Brigade who seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat in February 1921. He established a [[constitutional monarchy]], deposing the last Qajar Shah, [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Ahmed Shah]], in 1925 and being designated monarch by the national assembly, to be known thenceforth as [[Reza Shah]], founder of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. There were widespread social, economic, and political reforms introduced during his reign and a number of these reforms led to public discontent which provided the circumstances for the Iranian Revolution. Particularly controversial was the replacement of [[fiqh|Islamic laws]] with Western ones and the forbidding of traditional Islamic clothing, [[Sex segregation and Islam|separation of the sexes]] and veiling of women's faces with the [[niqab]].<ref>[[#Mackey|Mackey]], p. 184</ref> Police forcibly removed and tore [[chador]]s off women who resisted his ban on the public hijab.

However, he would avoid entering into political issues, as did other religious leaders who followed him. Hence, no widespread anti-government attempts were organized by clergy during the rule of Reza Shah. However, the future Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] was a student of Sheikh Abdul Karim Ha'eri.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rajaee|first1=Farhang|title=Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran|date=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292774360}}</ref>\n\n=== Mosaddegh and The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (today BP) ===\n{{Main|Mohammad Mosaddegh|Anglo-Persian Oil Company}}\nFrom 1901 on, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1931), a British oil company, enjoyed a monopoly on sale and production of Iranian oil. It was the most profitable British business in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bp-and-iran-the-forgotten-history/|title=BP and Iran: The Forgotten History|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> Most Iranians lived in poverty while the wealth generated from Iranian oil played a decisive role in maintaining Britain at the top of the world. In 1951 Iranian Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] pledged to throw the company out of Iran, reclaim the petroleum reserves and free Iran from foreign powers.\n\nIn 1952 Mosaddegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and became a national hero. The British, however, were outraged and accused him of stealing. The British demanded punishment from the [[World court|World Court]] and the [[United Nations]], sent warships to the [[Persian Gulf]] and finally imposed a crushing embargo. Mosaddegh was unmoved by Britain's campaign against him. One European newspaper, the [[Frankfurter Neue Presse]], reported that Mosaddegh \"would rather be fried in Persian oil than make the slightest concession to the British\". The British considered an armed invasion, but U.K. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] decided on a coup after U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] refused to provide American military support. Truman sympathized with nationalist movements like Mosaddegh's and had nothing but contempt for old-style imperialists like those who ran the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Mosaddegh, however, learned of Churchill's plans and ordered the British embassy to be closed in October 1952. All British diplomats and agents were forced to leave the country.\n\nAlthough the British were initially turned down in their request for American support by President Truman, the election of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as U.S. president in November 1952 changed the American stance toward the conflict. On 20 January 1953, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and his brother, Director of the [[C.I.A.]] [[Allen Dulles]], told their British counterparts that they were ready to move against Mosaddegh. In their eyes, any country not decisively allied with the United States was a potential enemy. Iran had immense oil wealth, a long border with the [[Soviet Union]] and a nationalist prime minister. The prospect of a fall into communism and a \"second [[China]]\" (after [[Mao Zedong]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]]) terrified the Dulles brothers.

Mohammad Reza Shah's reform program was built especially to weaken those classes that supported the traditional system. It consisted of several elements including land reform; sales of some state-owned factories to finance the land reform; the enfranchisement of women; nationalization of forests and pastures; formation of a literacy corps; and institution of profit sharing schemes for workers in industry.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Amir Arjomand, Said|title=The Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=72\u201373|isbn=9780195042580}}</ref>\n\nThe Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards westernization,<ref>{{cite news|title=Iran: The White Revolution|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=11 February 1966|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201232009/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|archivedate=1 February 2011}}</ref> and it was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the influence of landlords and to create a new base of support among the peasants and working class.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Siavoshi, Sussan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Iran: The failure of a movement|location=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=Westview Press|year=1990|page=23|isbn=978-0-8133-7413-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bayar, Assef|chapter=Historiography, class, and Iranian workers|editor=Lockman, Zachary|year=1994|title=Workers and Working Classes in the Middle East: Struggles, Histories, Historiographies|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFzOVmj1iCIC&pg=PA198 |page=198 |isbn=978-0-7914-1665-5}}</ref>\n\nThus the White Revolution in Iran was an attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, the essence of the White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city. What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution led to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid. The Shah's reforms more than quadrupled the combined size of the two classes that had posed the most challenges to his monarchy in the past \u2013 the intelligentsia and the urban working class. Their resentment towards the Shah also grew since they were now stripped of organizations that had represented them in the past, such as political parties, professional associations, trade unions, and independent newspapers. The land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. Many of the masses felt resentment towards the increasingly corrupt government; their loyalty to the clergy, who were seen as more concerned with the fate of the populace, remained consistent or increased. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out: \"The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution. Instead, it paved the way for an Islamic Revolution.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|page=143}}</ref> The White Revolution's economic \"[[Trickle-down economics|trickle-down]]\" strategy also did not work as intended. In theory, oil money funneled to the elite was supposed to be used to create jobs and factories, eventually distributing the money, but instead the wealth tended to get stuck at the top and concentrated in the hands of the very few.<ref>{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|page=140}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise and exile of Ayatollah Khomeini ===\n{{Main|Ruhollah Khomeini}}\n{{See also|Movement of 15 Khordad|Ruhollah Khomeini's return to Iran#Exile}}\n[[File:Chomeini97.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Khomeini]]\n\nThe post-revolutionary leader \u2013 Shia cleric [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] \u2013 first came to political prominence in 1963 when he led opposition to the Shah and his [[White Revolution]].

Khomeini left Iraq, instead moving to a house bought by Iranian exiles in [[Neauphle-le-Ch\u00e2teau]], a village near Paris, France. The Shah hoped that Khomeini would be cut off from the mosques of Najaf and be cut off from the protest movement. Instead, the plan backfired badly.

Other than the politicization of women, there were particular circumstances during the revolution which pushed women into being involved with politics.

Brooks argues that women were left to express their concerns through the protest rather than in the [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]. Thus, this created a \"dangerous bargaining position for activist women\" since rather than arguing and their position through intellect they were only able to \"argue by numbers in the streets and be repelled by force\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThere are some contesting understandings in academic literature regarding the reasons behind the mobilization of women.

In Iran there was an immediate outcry, and both Khomeini and leftist groups demanded the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November 1979 youthful Islamists, calling themselves [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], invaded the US embassy compound in Tehran and [[Iran hostage crisis|seized its staff]]. Revolutionaries were angry because of how the Shah had fled abroad while the Embassy-based American CIA and British intelligence organized a [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] to overthrow his nationalist opponent who was a legitimately elected official. The students held 52 American diplomats hostage for 444 days, which played a role in helping to pass the constitution, suppressing moderates, and otherwise radicalising the revolution.\n\nHolding the hostages was very popular and continued even after the death of the Shah. As Khomeini explained to his future President [[Abolhassan Banisadr|Banisadr]], \"This action has many benefits. ... This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty ...\"<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], p. 228</ref>\n\nWith great publicity the students released documents from the American embassy, or \"nest of spies,\" showing moderate Iranian leaders had met with U.S. officials (similar evidence of high-ranking Islamists having done so did not see the light of day).<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 248\u201349</ref> Among the casualties of the hostage crisis was Prime Minister Bazargan and his government, who resigned in November unable to enforce the government's order to release the hostages.<ref>[[#Keddie|Keddie]], p. 249</ref>\n\nThe prestige of Khomeini and the hostage taking was further enhanced with the failure of a hostage rescue attempt, widely credited to divine intervention.<ref>Bowden, Mark, ''Guests of the Ayatollah'', Atlantic Monthly Press, 2006, p. 487</ref>\n\nThe hostage crisis ended with the signing of the [[Algiers Accords]] in Algeria on 19 January 1981. The hostages were formally released to United States custody the following day, just minutes after [[Ronald Reagan]] was sworn in as the new American president.\n\n==== Suppression of opposition ====\n{{see also|Nojeh coup plot}}\n[[File:Firing Squad in Iran.jpg|thumb|A revolutionary firing squad in 1979]]\nIn early March 1979 Khomeini announced, \"do not use this term, 'democratic.'

Khomeini attacked the MEK as ''[[Munafiq|monafeqin]] ''(hypocrites) and ''[[kafir|kafer]]'' (unbelievers).<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 234, 239</ref> ''Hezbollahi'' people attacked meeting places, bookstores, and newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists,<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 123.</ref> driving them underground.

An attempt by Khomeini to forge a reconciliation between Banisadr and IRP leaders had failed,<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 153</ref> and now it was Banisadr who was the rallying point \"for all doubters and dissidents\" of the theocracy, including the MEK.<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], p. 238</ref>\n\nWhen leaders of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] called for a demonstration in June 1981 in favor of Banisadr, Khomeini threatened its leaders with the death penalty for [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] \"if they did not repent\".<ref>[[#Schirazi|Schirazi]], p. 127.</ref> Leaders of the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] were compelled to make and publicly broadcast apologies for supporting the Front's appeal.<ref>[[#Schirazi|Schirazi]], p. 127</ref> Those attending the rally were menaced by Hezbollahi and Revolutionary Guards and intimidated into silence.<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], pp. 158\u201359</ref>\n\nThe MEK retaliated with a campaign of terror against the IRP. On 28 June 1981, a bombing of the office of the IRP killed around 70 high-ranking officials, cabinet members and members of parliament, including [[Mohammad Beheshti]], the secretary-general of the party and head of the Islamic Republic's judicial system. The government responded with thousands of arrests and hundreds of executions.<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 241\u201342.</ref> Despite these and other assassinations<ref name=autogenerated3 /> the hoped-for mass uprising and armed struggle against the Khomeiniists was crushed.\n\nThe MEK bombings were not the only violent opposition to the Khomeinist rule.

This alarmed many of Iran's neighbours, particularly Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia as well as Western nations dependent on Middle Eastern oil for their energy needs.\n\nIn September 1980, Iraq took advantage of the febrile situation invaded Iran. At the centre of Iraq's objectives was the annexation of the East Bank of the Shaat Al-Arab waterway that makes up part of the border between the two nations and which had been the site of numerous border skirmishes between the two countries going back to the late 1960s. The president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, also wanted to annex the Iranian province of Khuzestan which had (and still has) a high population of Iranian Arabs. There was also concern that a Shia-centric revolution in Iran may stimulate a similar uprising in Iraq, where the country's Sunni minority ruled over the Shia majority.\n\nHussein was confident that with Iraq's armed forces being well-equipped with new technology and with high morale would enjoy a decisive strategic advantage against an Iranian military that had recently had much of its command officers purged following the Revolution. Iran was also struggling to find replacement parts for much of its US- and British-supplied equipment.

Islamist insurgents rose in [[Grand Mosque Seizure|Saudi Arabia (1979)]], [[Anwar Al Sadat#Assassination|Egypt (1981)]], [[Hama massacre|Syria (1982)]], and [[April 1983 United States Embassy bombing|Lebanon (1983)]].<ref name = \"Kramer\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20101226222601/http://www.martinkramer.org/sandbox/reader/archives/fundamentalist-islam-the-drive-for-power/ Fundamentalist Power], Martin Kramer.</ref>\n\nIn [[Pakistan]], it has been noted that the \"press was largely favorable towards the new government\"; the [[Islamist]] parties were even more enthusiastic; while the ruler, [[General Zia-ul-Haq]], himself on an [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]] drive since he took power in 1977, talked of \"simultaneous triumph of Islamic ideology in both our countries\" and that \"Khomeini is a symbol of Islamic insurgence.\" Some American analysts noted that, at this point, Khomeini's influence and prestige in Pakistan was greater than Zia-ul-Haq's himself.<ref>[[Alex Vatanka]], ''Iran and Pakistan: Security, Diplomacy and American Influence'', I.B.Tauris (2015), pp. 148 & 155</ref> Because Khomeini claimed that Americans were behind the [[1979 Grand Mosque seizure]], some hundred student protesters from the [[Quaid-e-Azam University]] in [[Islamabad]] [[1979 U.S. embassy burning in Islamabad|attacked the US embassy]], setting it on fire and taking hostages. The crisis was eventually quickly defused by the Pakistan army but the next day, to some 120 senior Pakistani army officers in Iran, stationed there on their road to [[hajj]], in a televised encounter, Khomeini said that \"it is a cause of joy that\u2026 all Pakistan has risen against the United States\" and the struggle is not that of the US and Iran but \"the entire world of disbelief and the world of Islam\". According to journalist [[Yaroslav Trofimov]], \"the Pakistani officers, many of whom had graduated from Western military academies, seemed swayed by the ayatollah\u2019s intoxicating words.\"<ref>Yaroslav Trofimov, ''The Siege of Mecca: The 1979 Uprising at Islam's Holiest Shrine'', Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group (2008), p. 140</ref>\n\nAlthough ultimately only the Lebanese Islamists succeeded, other activities have had more long-term impact. The Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 [[fatwa]] calling for the killing of Indian-born British citizen [[Salman Rushdie]] had international impact.

The attempt was a reaction to the secular political discourse namely [[Marxism]], liberalism and nationalism. However one could observe the great influence of western culture in Iran after the coup d'\u00e9tat in 1953. Following the death of Ayatollah Boroujerdi, some of the scholars like [[Morteza Motahhari|Murtaza Mutahhari]], [[Mohammad Beheshti|Muhammad Beheshti]] and [[Muhmud Talighani]] found new opportunity to change conditions. Before them, Boroujerdi was considered a conservative Marja. They tried to reform conditions after the death of the ayatollah. They presented their arguments by rendering lectures in 1960 and 1963 in Tehran. The result of the lectures was the book \"[[An inquiry into principles of Mar'jaiyat]]\". Some of the major issues highlighted were the government in Islam, the need for the clergy's independent financial organization, Islam as a way of life, advising and guiding youth and necessity of being community. Allameh Tabatabei refers to velayat as a political philosophy for Shia and velayat faqih for Shia community. There are also other attempts to formulate a new attitude of Islam such as the publication of three volumes of Maktab Tashayyo.

The clergy first showed itself to be a powerful political force in opposition to the monarchy with the 1891 [[Tobacco protest]]. On 20 March 1890, [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Nasir al-Din Shah]] granted a concession to Major G. F.

The revolution led to the establishment of a parliament, the [[National Consultative Assembly]] (also known as the Majlis), and approval of the first constitution. Although the constitutional revolution was successful in weakening the autocracy of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] regime, it failed to provide a powerful alternative government. Therefore, in the decades following the establishment of the new parliament, a number of critical events took place. Many of these events can be viewed as a continuation of the struggle between the constitutionalists and the Shahs of Persia, many of whom were backed by foreign powers against the parliament.\n\n=== Reza Shah ===\n{{Main|Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h}}\nInsecurity and chaos created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan, the commander of the elite Persian Cossack Brigade who seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat in February 1921. He established a [[constitutional monarchy]], deposing the last Qajar Shah, [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Ahmed Shah]], in 1925 and being designated monarch by the national assembly, to be known thenceforth as [[Reza Shah]], founder of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. There were widespread social, economic, and political reforms introduced during his reign and a number of these reforms led to public discontent which provided the circumstances for the Iranian Revolution. Particularly controversial was the replacement of [[fiqh|Islamic laws]] with Western ones and the forbidding of traditional Islamic clothing, [[Sex segregation and Islam|separation of the sexes]] and veiling of women's faces with the [[niqab]].<ref>[[#Mackey|Mackey]], p. 184</ref> Police forcibly removed and tore [[chador]]s off women who resisted his ban on the public hijab.

However, he would avoid entering into political issues, as did other religious leaders who followed him. Hence, no widespread anti-government attempts were organized by clergy during the rule of Reza Shah. However, the future Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] was a student of Sheikh Abdul Karim Ha'eri.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rajaee|first1=Farhang|title=Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran|date=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292774360}}</ref>\n\n=== Mosaddegh and The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (today BP) ===\n{{Main|Mohammad Mosaddegh|Anglo-Persian Oil Company}}\nFrom 1901 on, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1931), a British oil company, enjoyed a monopoly on sale and production of Iranian oil. It was the most profitable British business in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bp-and-iran-the-forgotten-history/|title=BP and Iran: The Forgotten History|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> Most Iranians lived in poverty while the wealth generated from Iranian oil played a decisive role in maintaining Britain at the top of the world. In 1951 Iranian Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] pledged to throw the company out of Iran, reclaim the petroleum reserves and free Iran from foreign powers.\n\nIn 1952 Mosaddegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and became a national hero. The British, however, were outraged and accused him of stealing. The British demanded punishment from the [[World court|World Court]] and the [[United Nations]], sent warships to the [[Persian Gulf]] and finally imposed a crushing embargo. Mosaddegh was unmoved by Britain's campaign against him. One European newspaper, the [[Frankfurter Neue Presse]], reported that Mosaddegh \"would rather be fried in Persian oil than make the slightest concession to the British\". The British considered an armed invasion, but U.K. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] decided on a coup after U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] refused to provide American military support. Truman sympathized with nationalist movements like Mosaddegh's and had nothing but contempt for old-style imperialists like those who ran the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Mosaddegh, however, learned of Churchill's plans and ordered the British embassy to be closed in October 1952. All British diplomats and agents were forced to leave the country.\n\nAlthough the British were initially turned down in their request for American support by President Truman, the election of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as U.S. President in November 1952 changed the American stance toward the conflict. On 20 January 1953, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and his brother, Director of the [[C.I.A.]] [[Allen Dulles]], told their British counterparts that they were ready to move against Mosaddegh. In their eyes, any country not decisively allied with the United States was a potential enemy. Iran had immense oil wealth, a long border with the [[Soviet Union]] and a nationalist prime minister. The prospect of a fall into communism and a \"second [[China]]\" (after [[Mao Zedong]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]]) terrified the Dulles brothers. [[Operation Ajax]] was born, in which the only democratic government Iran ever had was deposed.<ref>[[All the Shah's Men]]</ref>\n\n=== 1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n{{Main| 1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat }}\nIn 1941 Reza Shah was deposed, and his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], was installed by an [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|invasion of allied British and Soviet troops]]. In 1953, foreign powers (American and British) again came to the Shah's aid. After the young Shah fled to [[Italy]], the British [[MI6]] aided an American [[CIA]] operative in organizing a [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]] to oust the nationalist and democratically elected Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mossadegh]].<ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup|title=CIA admits role in 1953 Iranian coup &#124; World news &#124; The Guardian|work=theguardian|accessdate=18 October 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025072542/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup|archivedate=25 October 2014|date=19 August 2013|last1=Dehghan|first1=Saeed Kamali|last2=Norton-Taylor|first2=Richard}}</ref>\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi maintained a close relationship with the U.S. government, as both regimes shared an opposition to the expansion of the Soviet Union, Iran's powerful northern neighbor. Like his father, the Shah's government was known for its [[autocracy]], its focus on [[Modernization theory|modernization]] and [[Westernization]], and for its disregard for [[Iranian Constitution of 1906#The supplementary fundamental laws of 7 October 1907|religious]]<ref name=\"worldstatesmen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Iran_const_1906.doc|title=THE BASES OF THE PERSIAN CONSTITUTION, NAMELY\u2026|accessdate=18 October 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930185254/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Iran_const_1906.doc|archivedate=30 September 2013}}</ref> and democratic measures in [[Iranian Constitution of 1906|Iran's constitution]].

Mohammad Reza Shah's reform program was built especially to weaken those classes that supported the traditional system. It consisted of several elements including land reform; sales of some state-owned factories to finance the land reform; the enfranchisement of women; nationalization of forests and pastures; formation of a literacy corps; and institution of profit sharing schemes for workers in industry.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Amir Arjomand, Said|title=The Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=72\u201373|isbn=9780195042580}}</ref>\n\nThe Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards westernization,<ref>{{cite news|title=Iran: The White Revolution|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=11 February 1966|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201232009/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|archivedate=1 February 2011}}</ref> and it was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the influence of landlords and to create a new base of support among the peasants and working class.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Siavoshi, Sussan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Iran: The failure of a movement|location=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=Westview Press|year=1990|page=23|isbn=978-0-8133-7413-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bayar, Assef|chapter=Historiography, class, and Iranian workers|editor=Lockman, Zachary|year=1994|title=Workers and Working Classes in the Middle East: Struggles, Histories, Historiographies|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFzOVmj1iCIC&pg=PA198 |page=198 |isbn=978-0-7914-1665-5}}</ref>\n\nThus the White Revolution in Iran was an attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, the essence of the White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city. What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution led to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid. The Shah's reforms more than quadrupled the combined size of the two classes that had posed the most challenges to his monarchy in the past \u2013 the intelligentsia and the urban working class. Their resentment towards the Shah also grew since they were now stripped of organizations that had represented them in the past, such as political parties, professional associations, trade unions, and independent newspapers. The land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. Many of the masses felt resentment towards the increasingly corrupt government; their loyalty to the clergy, who were seen as more concerned with the fate of the populace, remained consistent or increased. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out: \"The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution.

However it's important to note that \"women were not united in their opinions of the revolution and its outcome as much as they were not united in their reasons for joining the revolution\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Women and revolution in Iran |last=Nashat |first=Guity |date=1983 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=0-86531-931-6 |pages=77}}</ref> Despite this mobilization and high rate participation of women, they were still kept out of leadership positions which were exclusive to men; women are thought to be part of the rank and file rather than the elite strata of the revolution.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Academic literature on women's participation ====\nWhile there has been some academic literature exploring individual narratives of women on the revolution,<ref name=\":1\" /> most of the academic work produced focuses on the effect of the revolution on women rather than the role of Iranian women during the revolution. Scholar [[Guity Nashat]] highlights this neglected aspect of the revolution, \"Although women's participation in the events leading to the February 11 revolution was instrumental in its success, most studies have not addressed the reasons for their involvement or their contribution.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Women and revolution in Iran |last=Nashat |first=Guity |date=1983 |publisher=Westview Press|isbn=0-86531-931-6 |pages=1}}</ref> Janet Baur argues the necessity of examining the daily lives of women, their living conditions and their relationship to other groups in order to understand their participation in the socio-political events of the revolution. She further explains that the cultural, ideological, social and material factors shaping the social life and class differences in the period just prior to the revolution need to be studied in order to understand how the Iranian women's social consciousness developed and how it led them to take part in public protests.<ref name=\":2\" /> Caroline M. Brooks argues that women were left to express their concerns through the protest rather than in the [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]. Thus, this created a \"dangerous bargaining position for activist women\" since rather than arguing and their position through intellect they were only able to \"argue by numbers in the streets and be repelled by force\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThere are some contesting understandings in academic literature regarding the reasons behind the mobilization of women. While some argue that the micro level actions of women can be understood through religious and political ideologies, others argue that it is in fact the effect of manipulations of information, symbols and context which should be studied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Casualties ===\n{{Further|Casualties of the Iranian Revolution}}\nSome sources (such as [[Emadeddin Baghi]], a researcher at the [[Bonyad#Islamic Republic|Martyrs Foundation]]) claim 2,781 protesters and revolutionaries were killed in 1978\u201379 during the Revolution.<ref name=Baghi>[http://www.emadbaghi.com/en/archives/000592.php#more \"A Question of Numbers\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804172903/http://www.emadbaghi.com/en/archives/000592.php|date=4 August 2014}} IranianVoice.org, 8 August 2003 Rouzegar-Now Cyrus Kadivar</ref><ref>Researcher Emad al-Din Baghi at the Martyrs Foundation (Bonyad Shahid) counted 2,781 protesters killed in 1978\u201379, a total of 3,164 killed between 1963 and 1979.</ref> Khomeini reported of a much larger number; he said that \"60,000 men, women and children were martyred by the Shah's regime.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">E.

In Iran there was an immediate outcry, and both Khomeini and leftist groups demanded the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November 1979 youthful Islamists, calling themselves [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], invaded the US embassy compound in Tehran and [[Iran hostage crisis|seized its staff]]. Revolutionaries were angry because of how the Shah had fled abroad while the Embassy-based American CIA and British intelligence organized a [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] to overthrow his nationalist opponent who was a legitimately elected official. The students held 52 American diplomats hostage for 444 days, which played a role in helping to pass the constitution, suppressing moderates, and otherwise radicalising the revolution.\n\nHolding the hostages was very popular and continued even after the death of the Shah. As Khomeini explained to his future President [[Abolhassan Banisadr|Banisadr]], \"This action has many benefits. ... This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty ...\"<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], p. 228</ref>\n\nWith great publicity the students released documents from the American embassy, or \"nest of spies,\" showing moderate Iranian leaders had met with U.S. officials (similar evidence of high-ranking Islamists having done so did not see the light of day).<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 248\u201349</ref> Among the casualties of the hostage crisis was Prime Minister Bazargan and his government, who resigned in November unable to enforce the government's order to release the hostages.<ref>[[#Keddie|Keddie]], p. 249</ref>\n\nThe prestige of Khomeini and the hostage taking was further enhanced with the failure of a hostage rescue attempt, widely credited to divine intervention.<ref>Bowden, Mark, ''Guests of the Ayatollah'', Atlantic Monthly Press, 2006, p. 487</ref>\n\nThe hostage crisis ended with the signing of the [[Algiers Accords]] in Algeria on 19 January 1981. The hostages were formally released to United States custody the following day, just minutes after [[Ronald Reagan]] was sworn in as the new American president.\n\n==== Suppression of opposition ====\n{{see also|Nojeh coup plot}}\n[[File:Firing Squad in Iran.jpg|thumb|A revolutionary firing squad in 1979]]\nIn early March 1979 Khomeini announced, \"do not use this term, 'democratic.'

This alarmed many of Iran's neighbours, particularly Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia as well as Western nations dependent on Middle Eastern oil for their energy needs.  \n\nIn September 1980, Iraq took advantage of the febrile situation invaded Iran. At the centre of Iraq's objectives was the annexation of the East Bank of the Shaat Al-Arab waterway that makes up part of the border between the two nations and which had been the site of numerous border skirmishes between the two countries going back to the late 1960s. The president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, also wanted to annex the Iranian province of Khuzestan which had (and still has) a high population of Iranian Arabs. There was also concern that a Shia-centric revolution in Iran may stimulate a similar uprising in Iraq, where the country's Sunni minority ruled over the Shia majority. \n\nHussein was confident that with Iraq's armed forces being well-equipped with new technology and with high morale would enjoy a decisive strategic advantage against an Iranian military that had recently had much of its command officers purged following the Revolution. Iran was also struggling to find replacement parts for much of it's US- and British-supplied equipment.

After some early successes, the Iraqi invasion stalled and was then repelled and by 1982, Iran had recaptured almost all her territories. In June 1982, with Iraqi forces all but expelled from Iranian territory, the Iraqi government offered a ceasefire.

The attempt was a reaction to the secular political discourse namely [[Marxism]], liberalism and nationalism. However one could observe the great influence of western culture in Iran after the coup d'\u00e9tat in 1953. Following the death of Ayatollah Boroujerdi, some of the scholars like [[Morteza Motahhari|Murtaza Mutahhari]], [[Mohammad Beheshti|Muhammad Beheshti]] and [[Muhmud Talighani]] found new opportunity to change conditions. Before them, Boroujerdi was considered a conservative Marja. They tried to reform conditions after the death of the ayatollah. They presented their arguments by rendering lectures in 1960 and 1963 in Tehran. The result of the lectures was the book \"[[An inquiry into principles of Mar'jaiyat]]\". Some of the major issues highlighted were the government in Islam, the need for the clergy's independent financial organization, Islam as a way of life, advising and guiding youth and necessity of being community. Allameh Tabatabei refers to velayat as a political philosophy for Shia and velayat faqih for Shia community. There are also other attempts to formulate a new attitude of Islam such as the publication of three volumes of Maktab Tashayyo. Also some believe that it is indispensable to revive the religious gathered in Hoseyniyeh-e-Ershad.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Samih Farsoun, MehrdadMashayekhi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Iran.html?id=S1RsZrwm2p4C|title=Iran: Political Culture in the Islamic Republic|isbn=9780203993514|date=7 January 1993}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:\u0632\u062e\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628\u06cc.JPG|An injured revolutionary during protests against Pahlavi regime.\nFile:\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628\u06cc.JPG|Protests in summer 1978.\nFile:\u0634\u0647\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628\u06cc.JPG|Revolutionary victims.\nFile:Ali Khamenei in Iranian Revolution protests.jpg|Current Iranian leader, [[Ali Khamenei]] in a Revolutionary protest in [[Mashhad]].\nFile:Shapour Bakhtiar Cabinet.jpg|Shah visiting Bakhtiar cabinet before his exit from Iran.\nFile:Shah's exit from Iran 04.jpg|People celebrating Shah's exit from the country.\nFile:Statue of Shah Revolution.jpg|Removal of Shah's statue by the people in [[University of Tehran]].\nFile:\u062e\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f.JPG|Khomeini at [[Mehrabad Airport]].\nFile:\u062e\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645.JPG|People accompanying Khomeini from Mehrabad to [[Behesht Zahra]].\nFile:\u062e\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0647\u0634\u062a \u0632\u0647\u0631\u0627.JPG|Khomeini in Behesht Zahra.\nFile:Imam Khomeini and Taleghani (2).jpg|Khomeini before a speech at Alavi school.\n</gallery>\n\n== Depictions in US media ==\n\n* ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'', starring [[Ben Affleck]], a film on the US government rescuing Americans in Tehran.\n\n*  ''[[Persepolis (comic)|Persepolis]]'' is an autobiographical series of comics by [[Marjane Satrapi]] first published in 2000 that depicts the author's childhood in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution.
