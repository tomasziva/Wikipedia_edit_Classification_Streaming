Players match notes that scroll on-screen to colored [[fret]] buttons on the controller, [[strum]]ming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited.  The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast-fignring [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s and the use of the [[whammy bar]] to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. With the introduction of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, the game includes support for a four-player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly [[cover version]]s of songs created by [[WaveGroup Sound]], but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully [[master recording]]s, and in some cases, special re-recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for [[downloadable content]] in the form of new songs.\n\nIn 2005, RedOctane, a company specializing in the manufacture of unique game controllers, was inspired to create ''Guitar Hero'' based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for [[Konami]]'s ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'' [[arcade game]]. They enlisted [[Harmonix]], who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of [[USD|$]]1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by [[Activision]] in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by [[MTV Games]] and went on to create the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series of music games in the same vein as ''Guitar Hero''. Activision brought [[Neversoft]] (primarily known for their [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk'']] series of skateboarding games) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as [[Budcat Creations]] and [[Vicarious Visions]], have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems.\n\nThe series currently has twelve major releases on [[video game console|gaming consoles]], three on [[Handheld game console|handheld game consoles]], and four on [[mobile phones]], besides two [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], the ''[[DJ Hero]]'' series and ''[[Band Hero]]''. The ''Guitar Hero'' franchise was a primary brand during the emergence of the popularity of [[rhythm game]]s as a cultural phenomenon in North America. Such games have been utilized as a learning and development tool for medical purposes. The first game in the series was considered by several journalists to be one of the most influential video games of the first decade of the 21st century. The series has sold more than 25 million units worldwide, earning [[United States dollar|US$]]2 billion at retail, claimed by Activision to be the 3rd largest game franchise after the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]'' franchises; the third main title of the series, ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'', is also claimed by Activision to be the first single video game title to exceed $1 billion in sales.\n\nDespite early success, the series, along with the overall rhythm game genre, suffered from poor sales starting in 2009. Despite asserting consumer research suggested continued solid demand for the series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30754014/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/how-much-guitar-hero-too-much/#.WIkgtbGZNPO|title=How much \u2018Guitar Hero\u2019 is too much?|date=18 May 2009|publisher=}}</ref> Activision later stated that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh main title in the series was under development; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series' downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought.\n\nIn 2015, Activision announced the first new title to the series in 5 years, ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', released in October 2015. The title is considered a reboot of the series, with development being performed by [[FreeStyleGames]], who had developed the ''DJ Hero'' games previously. Following a lukewarm reception and sales, Activision laid off many of the game's developers and sold the studio to [[Ubisoft]], later shutting down the game's streaming DLC service.\n\n==History==\n===Origins and development at Harmonix (2005\u20132006)===\n[[File:Guitar_hero_logo.png|thumb|right|The original ''Guitar Hero'' logo features more pointed decorations on its letters, emphasizing its basis in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].]]\n[[File:Guitar hero new logo.svg|thumb|right|The new logo, which was introduced with ''Guitar Hero 5'' and used up through ''Warriors of Rock'', removes these sharp features so as to reflect the broader selection of music now included in the games.]]\n''Guitar Hero'' was created from a partnership between [[RedOctane]], then their own company that produced specialized video game controllers, and [[Harmonix]], a [[music video game]] development company who had previously produced ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'', ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'', and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]''. RedOctane was seeking to bring in a ''[[Guitar Freaks]]''-like game, highly popular in Japan at the time, into Western markets, and approached Harmonix about helping them to develop a music game involving a guitar controller. Both companies agreed to it, and went on to produce ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' in 2005.<ref name=\"screech\">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24 |url=http://media.www.dailyiowan.com/media/storage/paper599/news/2007/08/30/80Hours/While.Their.Guitars.Gently.Screech-2943258.shtml |title=While their guitars gently screech |publisher=[[The Daily Iowan]] |date=2007-08-30 |author=Johnson, Brent |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607013541/http://media.www.dailyiowan.com/media/storage/paper599/news/2007/08/30/80Hours/While.Their.Guitars.Gently.Screech-2943258.shtml |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref> The title was highly successful, leading to the development of its successful sequel, ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'', in 2006. While the original controllers for the first ''Guitar Hero'' game were designed by Ryan Lesser, Rob Kay, Greg LoPiccolo, and Alex Rigopulous of Harmonix and built by the Honeybee Corporation of China, subsequent iterations and future controllers were developed inhouse at RedOctane, with development led primarily by [[Jack McCauley]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/tag/jack-mccauley/ | first=Jim | last=Stevens | newspaper=[[Mercury News]] | date=2008-10-16 | accessdate=2010-09-22 | title=More guitar hero world tour tidbits}}</ref>\n\n===Sale to Activision and development by Neversoft (2006\u20132009)===\nBoth RedOctane and Harmonix experienced changes in 2006.

The company also began considering the expansion of the series to band-specific titles with ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]''. Later, in November 2008, Activision acquired [[Budcat Creations]], another development studio that had helped with the PlayStation 2 versions of ''Guitar Hero III'' and ''World Tour'', announcing that they would be helping to develop another game in the ''Guitar Hero'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55821 | title=Activision Buys Guitar Hero PS2 Developer Budcat, Working on 'New Guitar Hero Game' | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-11-10 | accessdate=2008-11-10 | first=Chris | last=Faylor }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Harmonix and MTV Games released a new music title through rival publisher [[Electronic Arts]], called ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''. It expanded upon the gameplay popularized by the ''Guitar Hero'' series by adding [[drum kit|drum]] and [[microphone]] instruments, allowing players to simulate playing songs as bands. Activision followed suit with the release of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, which supported multiple instruments. In 2009, Activision tripled its ''Guitar Hero'' offerings, and in addition to further continuation of the existing main series with ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'' and expansions, they introduced the titles ''[[Band Hero]]'', geared towards more family-friendly [[pop music]], and ''[[DJ Hero]]'', a game based on [[turntablism]] and featuring a number of [[DJ mix|mixes]]. With the release of ''Guitar Hero 5'', Activision considered the series to have moved away from its heavy metal basis into a broader selection of music. ''Guitar Hero 5'' is the first game in the series to use a new version of the series' logo; previous games used a logo in a font with sharper \"points\" on the letters, which was considered \"idiosyncratic with a vengeance\" to match the games' emphasis on heavy metal music. Activision used the services of the [[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]] design studio to refashion the game's logo. Pentagram developed a new font, removing some of the \"aggressive odd\" features to make the typeface more suitable and amendable to design feature incorporation to other games such as ''Band Hero'' and ''DJ Hero''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pentagram.com/en/new/2009/09/new-work-guitar-hero-1.php | title=New Work: Guitar Hero | publisher=[[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]] | date=2009-09-01

(2009\u20132015)===\nThe results of the expanded offerings did not contribute well to the series, alongside the [[late-2000s recession]]; sales of most rhythm games including ''Guitar Hero'' and ''DJ

FreeStyleGames were given [[Rein|free rein]] to reboot the ''Guitar Hero'' series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. ''Guitar Hero Live'' was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called ''GHTV'', discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.\n\nThough the game was praised as a reinvention of the ''Guitar Hero'' series, the game did not sell as well as Activision expected; due to lowered forecasts, Activision let go of about half of FreeStyleGames' developers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-01-layoffs-at-guitar-hero-live-dev-but-freestyle-games-to-remain-open | title = Layoffs at Guitar Hero Live developer | work = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 1 April 2016 | accessdate = 1 April 2016 | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole }}</ref> In January 2017, [[Ubisoft]] acquired FreeStyleGames from Activision, with unclear consequences for the game.<ref name=\"gamespot ubisoft\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-buys-guitar-hero-live-dj-hero-dev-from-act/1100-6447034/ | title = Ubisoft Buys Guitar Hero Live, DJ Hero Dev From Activision | first=  Eddie | last = Makuch | date = January 18, 2017 | access-date = January 18, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Activision shut down ''GHTV'' on December 1, 2018, reducing the available songs from almost 500 to the 42 present on-disc.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guitar Hero Live \u2013 GHTV Sunset |url=https://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Guitar-Hero-Live-GHTV-Sunset/ |website=Activision Support |accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Guitar Hero Live\u2019s Guitar Hero TV to shut down, dramatically reducing the song catalog |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/6/17434666/guitar-hero-live-shutdown-song-library-activision |website=Polygon |accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Games==\n===Main titles===\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The controllers bundled with ''Guitar Hero'' releases (from left to right): [[Gibson SG]]s for ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' (PlayStation 2) and [[Gibson Explorer]] for ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' (Xbox 360) and ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' (PC)]]\nThe original ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' was released on the [[PlayStation 2]] in November 2005. ''Guitar Hero'' is notable because it comes packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black [[Gibson SG]] guitar. Rather than a typical [[gamepad]], this guitar controller is the primary input for the game. Playing the game with the guitar controller simulates playing an actual guitar, except it uses five colored \"fret buttons\" and a \"[[strum]] bar\" instead of [[fret]]s and strings. The development of ''Guitar Hero'' was inspired by [[Konami]]'s ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'' video game, which at the time, had not seen much exposure in the North American market; RedOctane, already selling guitar-shaped controllers for imported copies of GuitarFreaks, approached Harmonix about creating a game to use an entirely new Guitar controller.

However, since the drum skin is not electronic but a rubber cover switch that duplicates certain buttons on the DS Lite, a player can simply press the buttons in time to play the drums. The game includes four-player local wireless play in a similar manner as ''Guitar Hero 5'' allowing any combination of instruments to be used. The game has a set of 30 songs; some are from ''Band Hero'' and others are from several ''Guitar Hero'' games' set lists.\n\n''Guitar Hero: On Tour'' does not work on the [[Nintendo DSi]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] because unlike the Nintendo DS, they do not have Game Boy Advance slots. ''Band Hero'' is limited to vocals and drums on the two consoles for the same reason.\n\n===Mobile phone versions===\n{{Main|Guitar Hero Mobile series}}\n''Guitar Hero III Mobile'' was released for mobile phones in 2007 and 2008, and was developed by MachineWorks Northwest LLC.  The base version of the game includes 15 songs from both ''Guitar Hero II'' and ''Guitar Hero III'', and has released a three-song add-on pack every month since January 2008.  The title has been downloaded by users one million times, with both [[Verizon]] and [[Hands-On Mobile]] claiming that over 250,000 songs are played a day on the platform.<ref>{{cite magazine | url =https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2320042,00.asp | title='Guitar Hero Mobile' a Smashing Success | date=2008-06-13 | accessdate=2008-06-23 | first=Andrew | last=Podolsky | magazine=[[PC Magazine]]}}</ref>\nThe two companies produced two other mobile-based ''Guitar Hero'' games; ''Guitar Hero III: Backstage Pass'', released in July 2008, adds [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements to manage the band's success in addition to the core rhythm game,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/891/891945p1.html?RSSwhen2008-07-18_091600&RSSid=891945 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231114752/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/891/891945p1.html?RSSwhen2008-07-18_091600&RSSid=891945 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2008-12-31 | title=Guitar Hero III: Backstage Pass Is Ready to Rock Your Phone | date=2008-07-18 | accessdate=2008-07-18 | website=IGN }}</ref> while the mobile version of ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', released in December 2008, expands each included track for play on both lead guitar and drums, mimicking the expansion of the console series to the full band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Guitar+Hero:+World+Tour/news.asp?c=8837 | title=Guitar Hero World Tour coming to mobile phones | publisher=Pocket Gamer | first=Stuart | last=Dredge | date=2008-09-10 | accessdate=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[Glu Mobile]] developed the mobile version of ''Guitar Hero 5'', released in the last quarter of 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24197 | title=Activision Taps Glu for Mobile Modern Warfare 2, Guitar Hero 5 | first=Danny | last=Cowen | date=2009-06-24 | accessdate=2009-06-25 | website=[[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>\n\n===Other games===\n[[File:Guitar Hero Arcade.jpg|thumb|150px|Guitar Hero Arcade]]\n{{anchor|Guitar Hero Carabiner}}\nActivision and RedOctane also worked with Basic Fun, Inc. to produce ''Guitar Hero Carabiner'', a [[handheld electronic game]] that features 30 and 60-second clips of ten of the songs from ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Guitar Hero II''.<ref name=\"carabiner announce\">{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS227690+12-Feb-2008+BW20080212 | title=Basic Fun Launches Guitar Hero Carabiner at Toy Fair 2008, 2008-02-17 \u2013 2008-02-20, Booth #1633 | date=2008-02-13 | accessdate=2008-03-11 | publisher=[[Yahoo!]] | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230558/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS227690+12-Feb-2008+BW20080212 | archivedate=2008-09-05 }}</ref><ref name=\"carabiner review\">{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/02/17/guitar-hero-carabiner-hands-on/ | title=Guitar Hero Carabiner hands-on | publisher=[[Engadget]] | date=2008-02-18 | accessdate=2008-03-11 | first=Paul | last=Miller}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Guitar Hero Arcade}}\n\nActivision and [[Konami]], who had previously worked together to make sure that the ''Guitar Hero'' series meets with Konami's patents on music games, developed an [[arcade game|arcade console]] version of the game, titled ''Guitar Hero Arcade'', distributed to arcades in early 2009.

The player in ''Guitar Hero'' must play the colored notes on the fret board in time with the music as they scroll through the target at the bottom. The score and current score multiplier are shown on the bottom left. The Rock Meter dial and Star Power indicator are shown on the bottom right. The remainder of the screen shows the player's character and band as they perform to the music.]]\nThe core gameplay of the ''Guitar Hero'' games is a [[rhythm video game]] similar to [[Konami]]'s ''[[Guitar Freaks]]''<ref name=\"simons\" /> and to a lesser extent [[Harmonix]]'s previous music games such as ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]''. The guitar controller is recommended for play, although a standard console controller can be used instead.<ref name=\"strategy guide\">{{cite book|author=[[BradyGames]]|title=Guitar Hero II Official Strategy Guide|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|year=2006|isbn=0-7440-0854-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/guitarheroiioffi0000unse}}</ref><ref name=\"gh2\">{{cite video game|title=Guitar Hero II|developer=[[Harmonix]]|publisher=[[RedOctane]]|date=2006-11-07|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]}}</ref> However, the guitar controller has been required for play ever since the inclusion of drum and vocal parts in the series. The game supports toggling the [[handedness]] of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />\n\nWhile playing the game, an extended guitar neck is shown vertically on the screen (the [[fret]]s horizontal), often called the \"note highway\", and as the song progresses, colored markers or \"gems\" indicating notes travel down the screen in time with the music; the note colors and positions match those of the five fret keys on the guitar controller. Once the note(s) reach the bottom, the player must play the indicated note(s) by holding down the correct fret button(s) and hitting the strumming bar in order to score points. Success or failure will cause the on-screen Rock Meter to change, showing how well the player is playing (denoted by red, yellow, and green sections). Should the Rock Meter drop below the red section, the song will automatically end, with the player booed off the stage by the audience. Successful note hits will add to the player's score, and by hitting a long series of consecutive successful note hits, the player can increase their score multiplier. There is a window of time for hitting each note, similar to other rhythm games such as ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', but unlike these games, scoring in ''Guitar Hero'' is not affected by accuracy; as long as the note is hit within that window, the player receives the same number of points.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />\n\nSelected special segments of the song will have glowing notes outlined by stars: successfully hitting all notes in this series will fill the \"Star Power Meter\". The Star Power Meter can also be filled by using the [[tremolo arm|whammy bar]] during sustained notes within these segments. Once the Star Power Meter is at least half full, the player can activate \"Star Power\" by pressing the select button or momentarily lifting the guitar into a vertical position. When Star Power is activated, the scoring multiplier is doubled until Star Power is depleted. The Rock Meter also increases more dramatically when Star Power is activated, making it easier for the player to make the Rock Meter stay at a high level. Thus, Star Power can be used strategically to play difficult sections of a song that otherwise might cause the player to fail.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" /> In the earlier entries of the series (up until ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith''), activating Star Power meant that players could not accrue more Star Power until the Star Power meter was fully drained and the effect ended. Starting with ''Guitar Hero: World Tour'', more Star Power can be collected even if the effect is active by completing more Star Power phrases, extending the Star Power's duration by doing so. When playing in cooperative play (with a bassist/rhythm guitarist in ''Guitar Hero II'' through ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'' or as a band in ''Guitar Hero: World Tour''), Star Power is shared between all the players and activation of Star Power is dependent on all players simultaneously activating it.\n\nNotes can be a single note, or composed of two to five notes that make a [[guitar chord|chord]]. Both single notes and chords can also be sustained, indicated by a colored line following the note marker; the player can hold the sustained note(s) keys down for the entire length for additional points. During a sustained note, a player may use the whammy bar on the guitar to alter the tone of the note. Also, regardless of whether sustains are hit early or late, if the fret is held for the full duration of the hold, the game will always award the same amount of score increase for the note. In addition, the games support virtual implementations of \"[[hammer-on]]s\" and \"[[pull-off]]s\", guitar-playing techniques that are used to successfully play a fast series of notes by only changing the fingering on the fret buttons without having to strum each note. Sequences where strumming is not required are indicated on-screen by notes with a white outline at the top of the marker instead of the usual black one, with ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' adding a white-glowing effect to make these notes clearer.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' features transparent notes that are connected by a purple outline; players may either simply tap the correct fret for these notes without strumming or utilize a touchpad on ''World Tour''{{'}}s guitar controller to mimic the [[slide (guitar technique)|slide technique]]. In addition, notes can now be played while a sustained note is being played. ''World Tour'' also adds an open string note for bass players, represented by a line across the fret instead of any note gems, that is played by strumming without holding down any fret buttons (the sixth installment, ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', features an open note sustain for bass instruments as well).\n\n[[File:Guitar-hero-world-tour-20080715103139463.PNG|right|225px|thumb|Gameplay of a whole band in [[Guitar Hero World Tour]] playing Billy Idol's \"Rebel Yell\". On top are vocals, bottom from left to right: lead guitar, drums and bass guitar.]]\n''Guitar Hero World Tour'' introduced drums and vocal tracks in addition to lead and bass guitar.  Drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks; the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line.  Certain note gems, when using a drum controller that is velocity-sensitive, are \"armored\", requiring the player to hit the indicated drum pad harder to score more points.  Vocal tracks are played similar to games such as ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points. ''Guitar Hero 5'' allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments.<ref name=\"gh5 preview\"/>\n\nWhile the song is playing, the background visuals feature the players' chosen [[avatar (computing)|avatar]], along with the rest of the band performing in one of several real and fictional venues. The reaction of the audience is based on the performance of the player judged by the Rock Meter. ''Guitar Hero II'' added special lighting and other stage effects that were synchronized to the music to provide a more complete concert experience.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" /> The games developed by Neversoft feature a simple storyline, usually about a band's quest for fame, which is told through animations played throughout the game. These animations were created by [[Chris Prynoski]] and his studio, Titmouse, Inc., who have also done animations for the animated show ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://games.ign.com/articles/963/963887p1.html | title=Titmouse Opens Game Studio | website=IGN | date=2009-03-19 | accessdate=2009-04-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\n[[File:Guitar-hero-3-gameplay.jpg|thumb|225px|right|In ''Guitar Hero III''{{'}}s two-player \"Battle Mode\", each player attempts to interfere with their opponent's performance using special power-ups while avoiding being distracted by those thrown by the opponent.]]\nThe main mode of play in the ''Guitar Hero'' games is Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional performance arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across the rest of the game. Players can choose their on-stage character, their guitar of choice, and the venue in which they wish to play. In this mode, the player can earn money from his/her performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus songs, additional guitars and finishes, your characters clothing and bonus content can be unlocked. Quick Play mode is a quicker method of playing songs, as it allows the player to select a track and difficulty, selecting the character, venue, and guitar and guitar skin for the player based on the song chosen. After successfully completing a song, the player is given a score, a percentage of how many notes they hit and a rating from three to five stars, and two in rare cases depending on his/her final score on the song, with money being awarded in ''Guitar Hero World Tour''.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />\n\nThe games have also added multiplayer modes.  Cooperative modes allow two players to play lead and either bass or rhythm guitar on the same song, working together towards the same score.  A competitive Face-Off mode allows two players to play against each other at different difficulty levels, each attempting to earn the best score on a song. Each player plays different portions of the song. There is also a Pro Face-Off mode, where two players battle at the same difficulty level. Unlike standard Face-off, each player attempts to play all of the notes in a song, while still trying to earn the highest score. In ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' this was advanced on, as players could play a Pro Face-Off game against each other on any difficulty level, the lower your difficulty, the more points were awarded so a player on a low difficulty could potentially beat a player on a more challenging difficulty. ''Guitar Hero III'' introduced Boss Battles, in which two players face off against each other, attempt to collect \"distractions\" to throw at their opponent, trying to make them fail.  With ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', up to four players can play cooperatively on lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals, while a total of eight players can compete in a Battle of the Bands.  The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions of the games support multiplayer modes over their respective network services.\n\nThe four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him/her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced number of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces the fourth (blue) fret button, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. The addition of the orange fret button forces players to move their fingers up and down the neck. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player and to simulate the player's hands to move in a sequence similar to a real guitar. A difficulty added in ''World Tour'' is Beginner, which only requires the player to strum to the basic rhythm; holding the fret buttons becomes unnecessary.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" /> Another new difficulty only for drums was added to ''Metallica'' known as Expert+, which uses the double bass pedal.\n\n''Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock'' is the sixth installment in the franchise and introduced a new take on the Career mode of previous games. Rather than being a quest for fame and glory with the band travelling through different venues, ''Warriors of Rock'' features the \"Quest Mode\" as the primary campaign mode. Quest Mode tells the story of an ancient warrior who was defeated by a powerful monster and his mystical guitar was lost. The player must amass a team of rockers to help recover this guitar and defeat the monster (called \"The Beast\"). As the player progresses through the mode, the rockers joining them will transform based on the number of stars earned from songs played. These transformations will empower the player with extra abilities in a song such as constant score multipliers or Star Power bonuses. These abilities are each unique to the individual rockers and by using them effectively, it is possible now to earn up to forty stars for a single song.\n\n===Characters and customization===\nWhen playing through Career mode or in other parts of the ''Guitar Hero'' games, the player has the option to select one of several pre-created avatar characters, who will be shown performing on stage as the player attempts a song, but otherwise has no effect on the gameplay.  A certain number of characters are available at the start of the game, but the player must spend in-game money earned by successful performances to unlock other characters.  Many of the characters reappear throughout the series, with the character roster changing as new characters are added or removed. Standby characters that have appeared in nearly all the games include the [[Heavy Metal Subculture|metalhead]] Axel Steel, extreme/Viking/thrash metalhead Lars \u00dcmlaut, punk rocker Johnny Napalm, alternative rocker Judy Nails, and hard rocker Casey Lynch. The developers utilized these characters in more detail within ''Warriors of Rock'', where each was given a unique setlist and venue based on their musical style, as well as a unique power within the game's Quest mode.\n\nSeveral games in the series feature caricatures of celebrity artists, such as [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Tom Morello]] and [[Bret Michaels]]  in ''Guitar Hero III'', [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] in ''World Tour'', [[Kurt Cobain]] in ''Guitar Hero 5'', and [[Taylor Swift]] and the band [[No Doubt]] in ''Band Hero''. The band-specific games, ''Aerosmith'', ''Metallica'', and ''Van Halen'' also feature the members of the respective bands. However, in late 2009, both [[Courtney Love]] and the members of No Doubt sought legal action against Activision for the misuse of their in-game characters singing or performing songs by other artists, which the musicians believe fell outside of their contract.\n\nThe ability for the players to create their own avatars was added in ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', and was based on Neversoft's existing character creation tools from the ''Tony Hawk'' series. Later games on the Xbox 360 and Wii allowed players to use the respective console's avatars as members of the band. In addition to unlocking characters, in-game money can be used to buy clothing, accessories and instruments that they are seen playing with.  The guitars can also be customized with special finishes purchasable through the in-game store.  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' includes the ability to fully customize any component of the guitar.  The in-game store in the series is also used to unlock bonus songs or special videos with interviews about the game or with the artists involved.\n\n===Soundtracks===\nMost of the games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series feature a selection of songs ranging from the 1960s to present day [[rock music]] from both highly successful artists and bands and independent groups.  ''Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s'' features songs primarily from the 1980s, while  ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith,'' ''Metallica,'' and ''Van Halen'' feature music from the respective bands and groups that inspired or worked with the bands. Songs with profanities have been censored.\n\nMany of the ''Guitar Hero'' games developed for the recent generation of consoles (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii) support [[downloadable content]], allowing players to purchase new songs to play in the respective titles.

Players match notes that scroll on-screen to colored [[fret]] buttons on the controller, [[strum]]ming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited.  The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast-fingering [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s and the use of the [[whammy bar]] to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. With the introduction of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, the game includes support for a four-player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly [[cover version]]s of songs created by [[WaveGroup Sound]], but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully [[master recording]]s, and in some cases, special re-recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for [[downloadable content]] in the form of new songs.\n\nIn 2005, RedOctane, a company specializing in the manufacture of unique game controllers, was inspired to create ''Guitar Hero'' based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for [[Konami]]'s ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'' [[arcade game]]. They enlisted [[Harmonix]], who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of [[USD|$]]1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by [[Activision]] in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by [[MTV Games]] and went on to create the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series of music games in the same vein as ''Guitar Hero''. Activision brought [[Neversoft]] (primarily known for their [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk'']] series of skateboarding games) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as [[Budcat Creations]] and [[Vicarious Visions]], have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems.\n\nThe series currently has twelve major releases on [[video game console|gaming consoles]], three on [[Handheld game console|handheld game consoles]], and four on [[mobile phones]], besides two [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], the ''[[DJ Hero]]'' series and ''[[Band Hero]]''. The ''Guitar Hero'' franchise was a primary brand during the emergence of the popularity of [[rhythm game]]s as a cultural phenomenon in North America. Such games have been utilized as a learning and development tool for medical purposes. The first game in the series was considered by several journalists to be one of the most influential video games of the first decade of the 21st century. The series has sold more than 25 million units worldwide, earning [[United States dollar|US$]]2 billion at retail, claimed by Activision to be the 3rd largest game franchise after the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]'' franchises; the third main title of the series, ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'', is also claimed by Activision to be the first single video game title to exceed $1 billion in sales.\n\nDespite early success, the series, along with the overall rhythm game genre, suffered from poor sales starting in 2009. Despite asserting consumer research suggested continued solid demand for the series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30754014/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/how-much-guitar-hero-too-much/#.WIkgtbGZNPO|title=How much \u2018Guitar Hero\u2019 is too much?|date=18 May 2009|publisher=}}</ref> Activision later stated that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh main title in the series was under development; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series' downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought.\n\nIn 2015, Activision announced the first new title to the series in 5 years, ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', released in October 2015. The title is considered a reboot of the series, with development being performed by [[FreeStyleGames]], who had developed the ''DJ Hero'' games previously. Following a lukewarm reception and sales, Activision laid off many of the game's developers and sold the studio to [[Ubisoft]], later shutting down the game's streaming DLC service.\n\n==History==\n===Origins and development at Harmonix (2005\u20132006)===\n[[File:Guitar_hero_logo.png|thumb|right|The original ''Guitar Hero'' logo features more pointed decorations on its letters, emphasizing its basis in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].]]\n[[File:Guitar hero new logo.svg|thumb|right|The new logo, which was introduced with ''Guitar Hero 5'' and used up through ''Warriors of Rock'', removes these sharp features so as to reflect the broader selection of music now included in the games.]]\n''Guitar Hero'' was created from a partnership between [[RedOctane]], then their own company that produced specialized video game controllers, and [[Harmonix]], a [[music video game]] development company who had previously produced ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'', ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'', and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]''. RedOctane was seeking to bring in a ''[[Guitar Freaks]]''-like game, highly popular in Japan at the time, into Western markets, and approached Harmonix about helping them to develop a music game involving a guitar controller. Both companies agreed to it, and went on to produce ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' in 2005.<ref name=\"screech\">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24 |url=http://media.www.dailyiowan.com/media/storage/paper599/news/2007/08/30/80Hours/While.Their.Guitars.Gently.Screech-2943258.shtml |title=While their guitars gently screech |publisher=[[The Daily Iowan]] |date=2007-08-30 |author=Johnson, Brent |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607013541/http://media.www.dailyiowan.com/media/storage/paper599/news/2007/08/30/80Hours/While.Their.Guitars.Gently.Screech-2943258.shtml |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref> The title was highly successful, leading to the development of its successful sequel, ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'', in 2006. While the original controllers for the first ''Guitar Hero'' game were designed by Ryan Lesser, Rob Kay, Greg LoPiccolo, and Alex Rigopulous of Harmonix and built by the Honeybee Corporation of China, subsequent iterations and future controllers were developed inhouse at RedOctane, with development led primarily by [[Jack McCauley]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/tag/jack-mccauley/ | first=Jim | last=Stevens | newspaper=[[Mercury News]] | date=2008-10-16 | accessdate=2010-09-22 | title=More guitar hero world tour tidbits}}</ref>\n\n===Sale to Activision and development by Neversoft (2006\u20132009)===\nBoth RedOctane and Harmonix experienced changes in 2006.

The company also began considering the expansion of the series to band-specific titles with ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]''. Later, in November 2008, Activision acquired [[Budcat Creations]], another development studio that had helped with the PlayStation 2 versions of ''Guitar Hero III'' and ''World Tour'', announcing that they would be helping to develop another game in the ''Guitar Hero'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55821 | title=Activision Buys Guitar Hero PS2 Developer Budcat, Working on 'New Guitar Hero Game' | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-11-10 | accessdate=2008-11-10 | first=Chris | last=Faylor }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Harmonix and MTV Games released a new music title through rival publisher [[Electronic Arts]], called ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''. It expanded upon the gameplay popularized by the ''Guitar Hero'' series by adding [[drum kit|drum]] and [[microphone]] instruments, allowing players to simulate playing songs as bands. Activision followed suit with the release of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, which supported multiple instruments. In 2009, Activision tripled its ''Guitar Hero'' offerings, and in addition to further continuation of the existing main series with ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'' and expansions, they introduced the titles ''[[Band Hero]]'', geared towards more family-friendly [[pop music]], and ''[[DJ Hero]]'', a game based on [[turntablism]] and featuring a number of [[DJ mix|mixes]]. With the release of ''Guitar Hero 5'', Activision considered the series to have moved away from its heavy metal basis into a broader selection of music. ''Guitar Hero 5'' is the first game in the series to use a new version of the series' logo; previous games used a logo in a font with sharper \"points\" on the letters, which was considered \"idiosyncratic with a vengeance\" to match the games' emphasis on heavy metal music. Activision used the services of the [[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]] design studio to refashion the game's logo. Pentagram developed a new font, removing some of the \"aggressive odd\" features to make the typeface more suitable and amendable to design feature incorporation to other games such as ''Band Hero'' and ''DJ Hero''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pentagram.com/en/new/2009/09/new-work-guitar-hero-1.php | title=New Work: Guitar Hero | publisher=[[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]] | date=2009-09-01

FreeStyleGames were given [[Rein|free rein]] to reboot the ''Guitar Hero'' series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. ''Guitar Hero Live'' was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called ''GHTV'', discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.\n\nThough the game was praised as a reinvention of the ''Guitar Hero'' series, the game did not sell as well as Activision expected; due to lowered forecasts, Activision let go of about half of FreeStyleGames' developers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-01-layoffs-at-guitar-hero-live-dev-but-freestyle-games-to-remain-open | title = Layoffs at Guitar Hero Live developer | work = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 1 April 2016 | accessdate = 1 April 2016 | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole }}</ref> In January 2017, [[Ubisoft]] acquired FreeStyleGames from Activision, with unclear consequences for the game.<ref name=\"gamespot ubisoft\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-buys-guitar-hero-live-dj-hero-dev-from-act/1100-6447034/ | title = Ubisoft Buys Guitar Hero Live, DJ Hero Dev From Activision | first=  Eddie | last = Makuch | date = January 18, 2017 | access-date = January 18, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Activision shut down ''GHTV'' on December 1, 2018, reducing the available songs from almost 500 to the 42 present on-disc.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guitar Hero Live \u2013 GHTV Sunset |url=https://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Guitar-Hero-Live-GHTV-Sunset/ |website=Activision Support |accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Guitar Hero Live\u2019s Guitar Hero TV to shut down, dramatically reducing the song catalog |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/6/17434666/guitar-hero-live-shutdown-song-library-activision |website=Polygon |accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Games==\n===Main titles===\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The controllers bundled with ''Guitar Hero'' releases (from left to right): [[Gibson SG]]s for ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' (PlayStation 2) and [[Gibson Explorer]] for ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' (Xbox 360) and ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' (PC)]]\nThe original ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' was released on the [[PlayStation 2]] in November 2005. ''Guitar Hero'' is notable because it comes packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black [[Gibson SG]] guitar.

Playing the game with the guitar controller simulates playing an actual guitar, except it uses five colored \"fret buttons\" and a \"[[strum]] bar\" instead of [[fret]]s and strings. The development of ''Guitar Hero'' was inspired by [[Konami]]'s ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'' video game, which at the time, had not seen much exposure in the North American market; RedOctane, already selling guitar-shaped controllers for imported copies of GuitarFreaks, approached Harmonix about creating a game to use an entirely new Guitar controller.

The drumming uses a special \"drum skin\" adapter designed for the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] to map the unit's face buttons to four drum pads. However, the peripheral is not compatible with the original Nintendo DS model or the Nintendo DSi. However, since the drum skin is not electronic but a rubber cover switch that duplicates certain buttons on the DS Lite, a player can simply press the buttons in time to play the drums. The game includes four-player local wireless play in a similar manner as ''Guitar Hero 5'' allowing any combination of instruments to be used. The game has a set of 30 songs; some are from ''Band Hero'' and others are from several ''Guitar Hero'' games' set lists.\n\n''Guitar Hero: On Tour'' does not work on the [[Nintendo DSi]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] because unlike the Nintendo DS, they do not have Game Boy Advance slots.

The score and current score multiplier are shown on the bottom left. The Rock Meter dial and Star Power indicator are shown on the bottom right. The remainder of the screen shows the player's character and band as they perform to the music.]]\nThe core gameplay of the ''Guitar Hero'' games is a [[rhythm video game]] similar to [[Konami]]'s ''[[Guitar Freaks]]''<ref name=\"simons\" /> and to a lesser extent [[Harmonix]]'s previous music games such as ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]''. The guitar controller is recommended for play, although a standard console controller can be used instead.<ref name=\"strategy guide\">{{cite book|author=[[BradyGames]]|title=Guitar Hero II Official Strategy Guide|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|year=2006|isbn=0-7440-0854-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/guitarheroiioffi0000unse}}</ref><ref name=\"gh2\">{{cite video game|title=Guitar Hero II|developer=[[Harmonix]]|publisher=[[RedOctane]]|date=2006-11-07|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]}}</ref> However, the guitar controller has been required for play ever since the inclusion of drum and vocal parts in the series. The game supports toggling the [[handedness]] of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />\n\nWhile playing the game, an extended guitar neck is shown vertically on the screen (the [[fret]]s horizontal), often called the \"note highway\", and as the song progresses, colored markers or \"gems\" indicating notes travel down the screen in time with the music; the note colors and positions match those of the five fret keys on the guitar controller. Once the note(s) reach the bottom, the player must play the indicated note(s) by holding down the correct fret button(s) and hitting the strumming bar in order to score points. Success or failure will cause the on-screen Rock Meter to change, showing how well the player is playing (denoted by red, yellow, and green sections). Should the Rock Meter drop below the red section, the song will automatically end, with the player booed off the stage by the audience. Successful note hits will add to the player's score, and by hitting a long series of consecutive successful note hits, the player can increase their score multiplier. There is a window of time for hitting each note, similar to other rhythm games such as ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', but unlike these games, scoring in ''Guitar Hero'' is not affected by accuracy; as long as the note is hit within that window, the player receives the same number of points.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />\n\nSelected special segments of the song will have glowing notes outlined by stars: successfully hitting all notes in this series will fill the \"Star Power Meter\". The Star Power Meter can also be filled by using the [[tremolo arm|whammy bar]] during sustained notes within these segments. Once the Star Power Meter is at least half full, the player can activate \"Star Power\" by pressing the select button or momentarily lifting the guitar into a vertical position. When Star Power is activated, the scoring multiplier is doubled until Star Power is depleted. The Rock Meter also increases more dramatically when Star Power is activated, making it easier for the player to make the Rock Meter stay at a high level. Thus, Star Power can be used strategically to play difficult sections of a song that otherwise might cause the player to fail.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" /> In the earlier entries of the series (up until ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith''), activating Star Power meant that players could not accrue more Star Power until the Star Power meter was fully drained and the effect ended. Starting with ''Guitar Hero: World Tour'', more Star Power can be collected even if the effect is active by completing more Star Power phrases, extending the Star Power's duration by doing so. When playing in cooperative play (with a bassist/rhythm guitarist in ''Guitar Hero II'' through ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'' or as a band in ''Guitar Hero: World Tour''), Star Power is shared between all the players and activation of Star Power is dependent on all players simultaneously activating it.\n\nNotes can be a single note, or composed of two to five notes that make a [[guitar chord|chord]]. Both single notes and chords can also be sustained, indicated by a colored line following the note marker; the player can hold the sustained note(s) keys down for the entire length for additional points. During a sustained note, a player may use the whammy bar on the guitar to alter the tone of the note. Also, regardless of whether sustains are hit early or late, if the fret is held for the full duration of the hold, the game will always award the same amount of score increase for the note. In addition, the games support virtual implementations of \"[[hammer-on]]s\" and \"[[pull-off]]s\", guitar-playing techniques that are used to successfully play a fast series of notes by only changing the fingering on the fret buttons without having to strum each note. Sequences where strumming is not required are indicated on-screen by notes with a white outline at the top of the marker instead of the usual black one, with ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' adding a white-glowing effect to make these notes clearer.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' features transparent notes that are connected by a purple outline; players may either simply tap the correct fret for these notes without strumming or utilize a touchpad on ''World Tour''{{'}}s guitar controller to mimic the [[slide (guitar technique)|slide technique]]. In addition, notes can now be played while a sustained note is being played. ''World Tour'' also adds an open string note for bass players, represented by a line across the fret instead of any note gems, that is played by strumming without holding down any fret buttons (the sixth installment, ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', features an open note sustain for bass instruments as well).\n\n[[File:Guitar-hero-world-tour-20080715103139463.PNG|right|225px|thumb|Gameplay of a whole band in [[Guitar Hero World Tour]] playing Billy Idol's \"Rebel Yell\". On top are vocals, bottom from left to right: lead guitar, drums and bass guitar.]]\n''Guitar Hero World Tour'' introduced drums and vocal tracks in addition to lead and bass guitar.  Drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks; the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line.  Certain note gems, when using a drum controller that is velocity-sensitive, are \"armored\", requiring the player to hit the indicated drum pad harder to score more points.  Vocal tracks are played similar to games such as ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points. ''Guitar Hero 5'' allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments.<ref name=\"gh5 preview\"/>\n\nWhile the song is playing, the background visuals feature the players' chosen [[avatar (computing)|avatar]], along with the rest of the band performing in one of several real and fictional venues. The reaction of the audience is based on the performance of the player judged by the Rock Meter. ''Guitar Hero II'' added special lighting and other stage effects that were synchronized to the music to provide a more complete concert experience.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" /> The games developed by Neversoft feature a simple storyline, usually about a band's quest for fame, which is told through animations played throughout the game. These animations were created by [[Chris Prynoski]] and his studio, Titmouse, Inc., who have also done animations for the animated show ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://games.ign.com/articles/963/963887p1.html | title=Titmouse Opens Game Studio | website=IGN | date=2009-03-19 | accessdate=2009-04-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\n[[File:Guitar-hero-3-gameplay.jpg|thumb|225px|right|In ''Guitar Hero III''{{'}}s two-player \"Battle Mode\", each player attempts to interfere with their opponent's performance using special power-ups while avoiding being distracted by those thrown by the opponent.]]\nThe main mode of play in the ''Guitar Hero'' games is Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional performance arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across the rest of the game. Players can choose their on-stage character, their guitar of choice, and the venue in which they wish to play. In this mode, the player can earn money from his/her performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus songs, additional guitars and finishes, your characters clothing and bonus content can be unlocked. Quick Play mode is a quicker method of playing songs, as it allows the player to select a track and difficulty, selecting the character, venue, and guitar and guitar skin for the player based on the song chosen. After successfully completing a song, the player is given a score, a percentage of how many notes they hit and a rating from three to five stars, and two in rare cases depending on his/her final score on the song, with money being awarded in ''Guitar Hero World Tour''.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" />\n\nThe games have also added multiplayer modes.  Cooperative modes allow two players to play lead and either bass or rhythm guitar on the same song, working together towards the same score.  A competitive Face-Off mode allows two players to play against each other at different difficulty levels, each attempting to earn the best score on a song. Each player plays different portions of the song. There is also a Pro Face-Off mode, where two players battle at the same difficulty level. Unlike standard Face-off, each player attempts to play all of the notes in a song, while still trying to earn the highest score. In ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' this was advanced on, as players could play a Pro Face-Off game against each other on any difficulty level, the lower your difficulty, the more points were awarded so a player on a low difficulty could potentially beat a player on a more challenging difficulty. ''Guitar Hero III'' introduced Boss Battles, in which two players face off against each other, attempt to collect \"distractions\" to throw at their opponent, trying to make them fail.  With ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', up to four players can play cooperatively on lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals, while a total of eight players can compete in a Battle of the Bands.  The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions of the games support multiplayer modes over their respective network services.\n\nThe four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him/her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced number of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces the fourth (blue) fret button, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. The addition of the orange fret button forces players to move their fingers up and down the neck. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player and to simulate the player's hands to move in a sequence similar to a real guitar. A difficulty added in ''World Tour'' is Beginner, which only requires the player to strum to the basic rhythm; holding the fret buttons becomes unnecessary.<ref name=\"strategy guide\" /><ref name=\"gh2\" /> Another new difficulty only for drums was added to ''Metallica'' known as Expert+, which uses the double bass pedal.\n\n''Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock'' is the sixth installment in the franchise and introduced a new take on the Career mode of previous games. Rather than being a quest for fame and glory with the band travelling through different venues, ''Warriors of Rock'' features the \"Quest Mode\" as the primary campaign mode. Quest Mode tells the story of an ancient warrior who was defeated by a powerful monster and his mystical guitar was lost. The player must amass a team of rockers to help recover this guitar and defeat the monster (called \"The Beast\"). As the player progresses through the mode, the rockers joining them will transform based on the number of stars earned from songs played. These transformations will empower the player with extra abilities in a song such as constant score multipliers or Star Power bonuses. These abilities are each unique to the individual rockers and by using them effectively, it is possible now to earn up to forty stars for a single song.\n\n===Characters and customization===\nWhen playing through Career mode or in other parts of the ''Guitar Hero'' games, the player has the option to select one of several pre-created avatar characters, who will be shown performing on stage as the player attempts a song, but otherwise has no effect on the gameplay.  A certain number of characters are available at the start of the game, but the player must spend in-game money earned by successful performances to unlock other characters.  Many of the characters reappear throughout the series, with the character roster changing as new characters are added or removed. Standby characters that have appeared in nearly all the games include the [[Heavy Metal Subculture|metalhead]] Axel Steel, extreme/Viking/thrash metalhead Lars \u00dcmlaut, punk rocker Johnny Napalm, alternative rocker Judy Nails, and hard rocker Casey Lynch. The developers utilized these characters in more detail within ''Warriors of Rock'', where each was given a unique setlist and venue based on their musical style, as well as a unique power within the game's Quest mode.\n\nSeveral games in the series feature caricatures of celebrity artists, such as [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Tom Morello]] and [[Bret Michaels]]  in ''Guitar Hero III'', [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] in ''World Tour'', [[Kurt Cobain]] in ''Guitar Hero 5'', and [[Taylor Swift]] and the band [[No Doubt]] in ''Band Hero''. The band-specific games, ''Aerosmith'', ''Metallica'', and ''Van Halen'' also feature the members of the respective bands. However, in late 2009, both [[Courtney Love]] and the members of No Doubt sought legal action against Activision for the misuse of their in-game characters singing or performing songs by other artists, which the musicians believe fell outside of their contract.\n\nThe ability for the players to create their own avatars was added in ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', and was based on Neversoft's existing character creation tools from the ''Tony Hawk'' series. Later games on the Xbox 360 and Wii allowed players to use the respective console's avatars as members of the band. In addition to unlocking characters, in-game money can be used to buy clothing, accessories and instruments that they are seen playing with.  The guitars can also be customized with special finishes purchasable through the in-game store.  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' includes the ability to fully customize any component of the guitar.  The in-game store in the series is also used to unlock bonus songs or special videos with interviews about the game or with the artists involved.\n\n===Soundtracks===\nMost of the games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series feature a selection of songs ranging from the 1960s to present day [[rock music]] from both highly successful artists and bands and independent groups.  ''Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s'' features songs primarily from the 1980s, while  ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith,'' ''Metallica,'' and ''Van Halen'' feature music from the respective bands and groups that inspired or worked with the bands. Songs with profanities have been censored.\n\nMany of the ''Guitar Hero'' games developed for the recent generation of consoles (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii) support [[downloadable content]], allowing players to purchase new songs to play in the respective titles.  Songs each cost approximately [[USD|$]]2 through the various online stores for the console's platform.  Prior to ''Guitar Hero 5'', downloadable content for earlier games will not work in other games in the series, save for songs from [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Death Magnetic]]'', which were available for ''Guitar Hero III'', ''World Tour'', and ''Metallica''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5046652/metallicas-new-album-hits-guitar-hero-friday | title=Metallica's New Album Hits Guitar Hero Friday | website=Kotaku | first=Brian | last=Crecente | date=2008-09-08 | accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref> Existing ''World Tour'' downloadable content for ''World Tour'' will be forward-compatible with ''Guitar Hero 5'', ''Band Hero''<ref name=\"gh5 preview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58645 | title=First Guitar Hero 5 Songs Include Johnny Cash; Compatibility with GH World Tour DLC Confirmed | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | first=Chris | last=Faylor | date=2009-05-15 | accessdate=2009-05-15 }}</ref> and ''Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock'', and for a small fee, some songs from both ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' and ''Guitar Hero Smash Hits'' can be exported to both ''Guitar Hero 5'' and ''Band Hero'', limited by music licensing.<ref name=\"ign gh5 hands-on\"/> Activision has also stated that they are considering a monthly [[subscription business model|subscription service]] to deliver downloadable content to user for future games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54774 | title=Guitar Hero DLC Subscription Being Evaluated by Activision, Plans to Make Lots of Money | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-09-16 | accessdate=2008-09-16 | first=Blake | last=Ellison}}</ref>  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' introduced a music creation mode that will allow players to create and share songs (excluding vocals) via the \"GHTunes\" service, which was also used in all other ''Guitar Hero'' games and ''Band Hero'' since its inclusion.

These compilations, such as \"''Killer Guitar Solos''\" and \"''Guitar Anthems of the <nowiki>'</nowiki>80s''\", include songs related to but not contained within the ''Guitar Hero'' series. Dusty Welch of RedOctane stated, \"Where there's music, there's ''Guitar Hero'', and with iTunes, we are able to provide fans with a central location for downloading their favorite rock
