Look at what I can do! was an English-born American composer and conductor.<ref name=Shearer836>''Home Front Heroes: A Biographical Dictionary of Americans During Wartime'', Volume 3, ed. Benjamin F. Shearer (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007), p. 836</ref> He was especially known for his [[film music]] compositions, which were written for many [[animation]], [[documentary film|documentary]], and feature films from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]].<ref name=Hischak691.3>Thomas S. Hischak, ''The Encyclopedia of Film Composers'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2015), pp. 691\u2013693</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2019}}\nWallace was born on August 6, 1887, in London. After completing his musical training, he went to the United States in 1904, becoming a US citizen ten years later.<ref name=Shearer836/> He initially worked primarily on the West Coast in Seattle as a conductor of theater orchestras and as an organist accompanying [[silent film]]s. At the same time, he also made a name as a songwriter, writing tunes such as the popular \"Hindustan\". With the advent of the talking film era, he worked increasingly for [[Hollywood]] film studios in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1936 he joined Disney Studios, and quickly became one of the most important composers in the studio for animated [[short film]]s. Wallace provided the music for 139 of these shorts. One of his best-known pieces is the song \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]\" from the 1942 [[Donald Duck]] [[propaganda]] cartoon, though he was uncredited. This parody of a [[Horst Wessel]] song was, mainly through the version by [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers, one of the biggest hits during the [[Second World War]]. Other shorts Wallace scored include ''[[Ben and Me]]'' (1953), about [[Benjamin Franklin]] and a mouse, and the [[Oscar award|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]'' (1953), the first cartoon to use the new [[Cinemascope]] process.\n\n[[Walt Disney]] also had Wallace score full-length films for the studios, starting as the uncredited conductor for [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|''Pinocchio'']], which he did not receive screen credit. However, his first credited appearance was ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), for which he, together with [[Frank Churchill]], won his first and only Oscar in 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1433381001959|title=1941 (14th)|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He went on to score ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]'' (1943), ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' (1949), ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950) along with [[Paul Smith (film and television composer)|Paul J. Smith]], ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' (1958). Wallace also voiced the villainous Mr. Winkie in ''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'', though he was uncredited as the voice actor. He received four other Oscar nominations for the music to ''Victory Through Air Power'' (Losing to [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] for ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]''), ''Cinderella'' (Losing to [[Adolph Deutsch]] and [[Roger Edens]] for ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''),  ''Alice in Wonderland'' (Losing to [[Johnny Green]] and [[Saul Chaplin]] for ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]''), and ''White Wilderness'' (Losing to [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] for ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]''). A common characteristic of all these productions was the cooperation of several composers in the creation of the music. Wallace understood this and integrated ''[[leitmotiv]]''-like elements from the individual songs into the film scores.\n\nWhen the Disney studios began to increasingly produce full-length feature films, Wallace also wrote scores for these. In ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1959), Wallace wrote not only the score but also set the [[Lawrence Edward Watkin]]-penned popular songs \"Pretty Irish Girl\" and \"The Wishing Song\". In ''Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks with the Circus'' (1959), he appeared as an actor, playing the conductor of the [[circus]] band.\n\nStarting with ''Seal Island'' (1948), Wallace also specialized in musical accompaniments for Disney documentaries, including nearly all the films for the \"People and Places\" series and some of the \"True Life Adventures\". The music of ''White Wilderness'' (1958) was even nominated for an Oscar in 1959, a rare event for a documentary film.\n\nOverall, Wallace contributed music to almost over 150 Walt Disney productions.<ref name=Hischak691.3/> He worked for Disney studios for 27 years.<ref name=apSJ>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&dat=19630916&id=ivceAAAAIBAJ&sjid=84sEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3430,1690226&hl=en|title=Noted Composer Oliver Wallace Is Dead at Age 76|author=Associated Press|date=September 17, 1963|publisher=Sarasota Journal|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref> He remained active in the studio in [[Los Angeles]] until shortly before his death at a [[Burbank, California]] [[hospital]] on September 15, 1963 at the age of 76.<ref name=apSJ/> In 2008 he was honored with a [[Disney Legends]] award.<ref>\"Barbara Walters And Frank Gifford Among 11 Honorees To Receive Prestigious Disney Legends Awards\", ''US Fed News Service, Including US State News'', ''The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd.''
