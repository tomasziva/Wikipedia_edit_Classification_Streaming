testing used is [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]]. In it, a carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres in the corresponding province or territory. At the centres, highly skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test chemically strips the RNA from the sample then mixes it with a test kit containing chemical reagents designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between a set of temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 4 to 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|title=cobas\u00ae 8800 System|url=https://diagnostics.roche.com/global/en/products/systems/cobas-8800-system.html|website=diagnostics.roche.com|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref> The actual RT-PCR test is 99% accurate.

testing used is [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]]. In it, a carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres in the corresponding province or territory. At the centres, highly skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test chemically strips the RNA from the sample then mixes it with a test kit containing chemical reagents designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between a set of temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 4 to 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|title=cobas\u00ae 8800 System|url=https://diagnostics.roche.com/global/en/products/systems/cobas-8800-system.html|website=diagnostics.roche.com|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref> The actual RT-PCR test is 99% accurate.
