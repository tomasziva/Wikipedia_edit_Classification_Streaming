Recent research, however, raises the question whether he ever really existed.\n\n==Background==\nAll current knowledge about \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in is based on anecdotes by the harper [[Arthur O'Neill (harpist)|Arthur O'Neill]], retold by Edward Bunting (1840), Charlotte Milligan Fox (1911), and Francis O'Neill (1913). Captain [[Francis O'Neill]] explained the uncertainty concerning his lifetime, stating he lived c.1570 to 1650 and that he was active during the first half of the 17th century.\n\nAccording to Arthur O'Neill, unlike the vast number of travelling musicians, \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in was a [[gentleman]] by birth, his family being hereditary allies of the [[O'Neill dynasty]]. Their territory was [[Keenaght (barony)]], now part of [[County Londonderry]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. Reflecting his origins, \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in \"traveled into [[Scotland]] attended by the retinue of a gentle man of large property, and when in Scotland, according to the accounts preserved there also, he seemed to have traveled in the company of noble persons.\"<ref>Francis O'Neill: ''Irish Minstrels and Musicians: With Numerous Dissertations on Related Subjects'' (Chicago: Regan, 1913; reprinted Cork: Mercier Press, 1987), p.&nbsp;60.</ref>\n\n==Compositions==\n\u00d3 Cath\u00e1in's best-known composition is ''Da mihi manum'' (English: \"[[Give Me Your Hand]]\"; Irish: ''[[Tabhair dom do L\u00e1mh]]''), published originally under its Latin title.<ref>http://www.earlygaelicharp.info/tunes/damihimanum/; retrieved 1 May 2020.</ref>\n\nThere is an anecdote about its composition:\n\n<blockquote>\"Proud and spirited, he resented anything in the nature of trespass on his dignity. Among his visits to the houses of Scottish nobility, he is said to have called at Eglinton Castle, [[Ayrshire]]. Knowing he was a harper, but being unaware of his rank, Lady Eglinton commanded him to play a tune. Taking offence at her peremptory manner, \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in refused and left the castle. When she found out who her guest was her ladyship sought and effected a speedy reconciliation. This incident furnished a theme for one of the harper's best compositions. ''Tabhair Damh do L\u00e1mh'' (or ''Give Me Your Hand''). The name has been Latinized into ''Da Mihi Manum''. The fame of the composition and the occasion which gave birth to it reaching the ear of King James the Sixth, induced him to send for the composer. \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in accordingly attended at the Scottish court and created a sensation.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"His performance so delighted the royal circle that [[King James I]] familiarly laid his royal hand on the harper's shoulder. When asked by one of the courtiers if he realized the honour thus conferred on him, to their consternation Rory replied: 'A greater than King James has laid his hand on my shoulder'. Who was that man?' cried the King. 'O'Neill, Sire', proudly answered Rory standing up.\" </blockquote>\n\nIn the late 20th century, the piece was wedded to ''Raggle Taggle Gypsy'' in a version by [[Planxty]] and has since enjoyed a huge resurgence.\n\n==Other compositions==\nBruce Armstrong attributed the following pieces to \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in:\n\n* ''Lude's Supper''\n* ''The Terror of Death''\n* ''The Fiddler's Content''\n* ''Rorie Dall's Sister's Lament''\n* ''The Derry Air''\n\nO'Neill thought that ''Port Athol'', ''Port Gordon'', and ''Port Lennox'', were all \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in's.\n\n''Seabhac Bheal Atha Seanaigh''/''The Hawk of Ballyshannon'', celebrating the wedding of Charles O'Donnell, son of Manus of Rosturk Mulranny, County Mayo, to a Miss More, composed to a tune by Rory Dall O'Cathan is printed in Bunting (1840, p.&nbsp;13).<ref>Edward Bunting: ''The Ancient Music of Ireland'' (Dublin: Hodges and Smith, 1840; reprinted Dublin: Walton's, 1969).</ref>\n\n==Death==\nO'Neill reports that he died in Scotland:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"It is a curious coincidence that after spending many years with McLeod, of Dunvegan, in the Isle of Skye, O'Cahan should die at Eglinton Castle about the year 1653. In some inaccountable way during his long sojourn in Scotland he became known as Rory Dall Morrison, and this has so clouded his origin and identity as to involve his very nationality in question.\"\n\nO'Neill was, however, mistaken as their lives didn't even overlap, Morrison being born on the Isle of Lewis around 1656 while \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in was born in Antrim in the 1580's.
