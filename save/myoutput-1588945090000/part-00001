DWRR-FM is operated by the Manila Radio division and the [[Star Cinema|Star Creatives Group]]. It is the number 1 FM radio station in Metro Manila, Mega Manila as well as the entire Philippines according to KBP Radio Research Council.<ref>https://radioonlinenow.com/tag/kbp-radio-research-council/</ref>\n\nIt was founded in 1956 as one of the radio stations of Chronicle Broadcasting Network (ABS-CBN). It was revived in 1986 and reformatted several times, it is broadcast live throughout the [[Philippines|Philippine]] archipelago, and throughout the world via [[The Filipino Channel]] (TFC). The studios are located at [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]], Sgt. Esguerra Ave., corner Mo. Ignacia Ave., Diliman, [[Quezon City]] and its 22.5 [[kilowatt|kW]] FM stereo transmitter is located at the Eugenio Lopez Center, Barangay Sta. Cruz, Sumulong Highway, [[Antipolo|Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]].\n\nAs of May 5, 2020, the station's broadcasting activities, together with that of its televsion and sister radio stations, are suspended following the cease-and-desist order issued by the [[National Telecommunications Commission]] due to the expiration of ABS-CBN's legislative license to operate.\n\n==History==\n===DZYL-FM/DZYK-FM/DZMM-FM (1956\u20131972)===<!-- NO NEED to specify the whole name. Same as the others below. -->\nDZYL-FM 102&nbsp;MHz, later named DZYK-FM 102.1&nbsp;MHz, is the first FM radio station in the Philippines and sole FM station of the former Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). DZYK-FM was founded in 1956 and played the latest pop songs of that time. In 1957, CBN bought Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) resulting in a merger under the name Bolinao Electronics Corporation, later named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967. Staffed by eight DJs, DZYK-FM 102.1&nbsp;MHz was popularized to listeners in [[Metro Manila|Greater Manila]] area. DZYK-FM remained as the FM radio station of ABS-CBN until the station was forced off the air by [[Ferdinand Marcos]] under martial law. In 1968, DZYK-FM moved to its current permanent frequency of 101.9&nbsp;MHz, and changed its call letters to DZMM-FM.\n\n===DWWK-FM/OK 101 (1973\u20131986)===\nWhen [[martial law]] was declared in 1972, DZMM-FM along with ABS-CBN's two TV channels and six AM radio stations in Manila were shut down under strict [[censorship]]. The FM station was taken over by Roberto Benedicto and changed to DWOK-FM (as OK 101.9) of the [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]], which had aired in 1973 as DWWK, a jazz format radio station. It was staffed by Jing Magsaysay, Wayne Enage, Ed Picson, Dody Lacuna, Ronnie Malig, Pinky Villarama and Ronnie Quintos. DWOK trailblazed another first  in the Philippine radio industry at that time as the first AM-formatted FM station which features news, public service programs, and music from the 1950s to the 1970s.  [[Helen Vela]] also came to the station in 1984 with her counselling program ''[[Lovingly Yours, Helen]]''. However, DWOK, [[DWAN-AM|DWAN]] (formerly known as DWWA) and BBC-2 had been dissolved since the government-controlled radio and TV stations were stormed by reformist rebels. It was given back to ABS-CBN after the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]], and returned on the air as DWKO \u2014 at that time it was on test broadcast.\n\n===Knock Out Radio (1986\u20131987)===\nThe fall of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos Regime]] in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution had paved the way for the return of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] in the Philippine broadcasting scene. In July 1986, then newly formed Presidential Commission on Good Governance turned two radio stations, DWWW (under 630 kHz) and DWOK-FM, over to ABS-CBN from Marcos ally Roberto Benedicto. DWOK (the former FM station of Benedicto-owned Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation) changed its callsign to DWKO and resumed broadcasting four months later. Lito Balquiedra Jr., Vice-President for Radio, spearheaded the return of the giant network to the local broadcasting scene. The station's former disc jockey [[Peter Musngi]] (then known as Peter Rabbit has worked Knock-Out Radio 101.9 and Zoo FM 101.9) has been the network's voice-over since the reopening in 1986. The slogan of the station was \"Panalo Ka Talaga!\", voiced by Peter Musngi.\n\nThe network started recruiting both experienced and new employees and DJs. Prior to the adoption of [[Mass media|masa]] format, all FM stations are English based with the use of the English language during the 1980s and 1990s. After days of careful planning and almost three months of test broadcast which took place on July 16 that year along with sister stations [[DZMM-AM|DZMM 630]] (which it began broadcasting the following week) and the parent station [[DWWX-TV|ABS-CBN Channel 2]] (which it began broadcasting in September of the same year), DWKO was born \u2013 the first ever FM radio station with an AM format, carrying the name '''Knock-Out Radio 101.9''' on September 14, 1986 (the same day the re-airing of ABS-CBN on channel 2) and playing the hits during that time. Since then, KO-Radio has aired Pinoy hits from singers of the 1970s and 1980s such as [[Rico J. Puno]], [[Yoyoy Villame]], [[APO Hiking Society]]. The station also debuted the songs of [[Original Pilipino Music]] (OPM) stars like [[Gary Valenciano|Gary V]], [[Regine Velasquez]], [[Janno Gibbs]] and [[Donna Cruz]], as well as Filipino Christmas songs. DWKO-FM ended its broadcast on February 28, 1987, and became one of the shortest lived iteration aired on the station in a span of almost 5 months.\n\nDuring that time, the station operated daily from 05:00 AM to 02:00 AM.\n\n===Zoo FM (1987\u20131989)===\nOn March 1, 1987 (following ''The Star Network'' era), the station reformatted as '''Zoo FM 101.9''' (DZOO-FM; read as D-Z-double O-FM), which is best known for its diamond logo and a slightly uptrend pop sound led to the introduction of OPM and [[disco]] hits. The jingles used for the station back then, were produced by [[JAM Creative Productions]]. Manned by a group of eight DJs (most notably, George Boone, Jeremiah Jr., Bob Curry, Bill O'Brien, and Andy Santillan, aka Dave Ryan, later known as \"The Unbeatable\"), the slogan of the station was ''Hayop Talaga!''. It also served as the home of OPM stars like [[Gary Valenciano|Gary V]], [[Randy Santiago]], [[Regine Velasquez]], [[Ogie Alcasid]], [[Sharon Cuneta]], and others. Due to its popularity, Zoo FM 101.9 heavily played OPM songs after the implementation of [http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1987/eo_255_1987.html Executive Order No. 255] by President [[Corazon Aquino]] and became a trend among listeners, because Zoo FM is being competed with other FM stations such as The Giant 97.1 WLS-FM (now [[DWLS|Barangay LS 97.1]]), 99.5 RT (now [[DWRT-FM|99.5 Play FM]]), [[DWTM|Magic 89.9]], [[DZMZ|89 DMZ]] (now [[DWAV|Wave 89.1]]), [[NU 107]] (now [[DWNU|Wish 1075]]) and more. But because of a massive competition from the rival WLS, Zoo FM decided to end its broadcast, having faltered from WLS's dominant listener ratings (and with GMA-7's TV ratings uprisings, despite the uprising being cut short in 1988 by the resurgence of ABS-CBN and the network being catapulted to first place in the TV industry) in January 1989. Two years later, DZOO-FM ended its broadcast on the night of July 31, 1989 (at 11:00 pm). Listeners and DJs bade goodbye to Zoo FM which gave its final broadcast, and with the last song, \"Farewell\" by [[Raymond Lauchengco]].\n\n===Radio Romance (1989\u20131996)===\nOn the morning of August 1, 1989 (at 6:00 am), it reformatted again and this time it became popularly known as '''101.9 Radio Romance''', hence the initials RR, playing all easy-listening love songs manned by all-female jocks such as [[Amy Perez]] (fewer male jocks are also added), and also became the first FM station, whose musical playlists were originated from [[Audio CD|compact discs]] (a technological innovation then). That year also signaled the station's first nationwide reach when [[DZRR|103.1 MHz Baguio]] simulcasted its signals, ensuring travelers from Manila to as far north as Ilocos Sur, uninterrupted listening of its programs, until it eventually simulcasted via satellite to other stations across the country in the early '90s. At the same time, OPM songs are also played on DWRR to produce its weekend OPM program every Sunday.\n\n\"Radio Romance\" became a title of the movie and a theme song of the station composed by [[Jose Mari Chan]] during its popularity. On April 28, 1996 Radio Romance signed-off due to its station reformat.\n\n===WRR 101.9 (1996\u20132009)===\nOn April 29, 1996, DWRR relaunched itself into a [[Middle of the road (music)|mainstream pop]] music station branded '''WRR 101.9''' and it became the first FM radio station to be fully broadcast in [[Filipino language]] in order to compete with rival English-language FM stations such as [[GMA Network]]'s [[DWLS|Campus Radio 97.1 WLS]], [[DWTM|Magic 89.9]] and [[DWRT-FM|99.5 RT]]. Before the end of that year, all ABS-CBN FM stations started to broadcast in their native languages switching from English. Initially, its slogan was ''All the Hits, All the Time!''. On November 2, 1998, WRR adapted the tagline ''For Life!'' (which is based from a [[DYLS-FM|co-owned station]] in Cebu), giving life to listeners with entertainment. In late 1999, DWRR transmitting equipment moved from ABS-CBN Broadcast Center which was used before martial law to the new transmitter tower at the Eugenio Lopez Center in Antipolo City due to the upgrading of the [[Millennium Transmitter]].\n\nIn July 2005, the WRR brand was dropped from the name and adapted the slogan ''Alam Mo Na 'Yan!'' (You Already Know It!), lasting from July 2005 to October 2008. In November 2008, the station changed its slogan to ''Bespren!'' (Bestfriend!).\n\nThe station had its last broadcast under the 101.9 For Life! brand on September 19, 2009 and underwent a transition period playing automated music in preparation for a relaunch of DWRR-FM's new branding on October 1, 2009. However, due to the onslaught of Typhoon [[Typhoon Ketsana|Ondoy (Ketsana)]] in Manila, the station rebrand was postponed for almost a month. For the time being, DWRR-FM temporarily went under the name \"ABS-CBN 101.9 FM\" or simply \"101.9\".\n\nThe postponed relaunch was set on November 4, 2009. Prior to the announcement of the launch date, the station's DJs began providing live spiels again every top of the hour since October 12. But as part of the ongoing transition, the jocks never mentioned its former brand or slogan & the format of the station's SMS syntax except the text hotline itself.\n\n===Tambayan (2009\u20132013)===\n[[File:Tambayan1019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The former logo of Tambayan 101.9 from November 4, 2009-May 2013.]]\n[[File:DWRR-FM101.9Logos.png|thumb|right|200px|Some logos used in Tambayan TV when the station was named as 101.9]]\n\nOn November 4, 2009 at 9:00pm, there was a broadcast about the history of DWRR. Following that, the station was relaunched as '''Tambayan 101.9''' (''tambayan'' is the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for ''hangout'') starting with the theme song & live debut at a venue in Makati. Tambayan launched its [[video streaming]] called Tambayan TV where DJs are seen live from the booth. In between songs playing, some information plugs were seen (such as Tambayan's Slumbook). Just like DZMM Teleradyo, plugs were also aired during commercial gaps. Tambayan TV is aired 24 hours over the Internet.\n\nThe station was also launched via [[HD Radio]] technology.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20091104-234254/New-name-direction-Tambayan-1019 |title=New name, direction: Tambayan 101.9 \u2013 INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos.

(2013\u2013present)===\n[[File:MOR1019logo2014.png|thumb|right|200px|The former logo of MOR 101.9 from January 1, 2014 up to 2017.]]\nOn July 8, 2013 at midnight, 101.9 FM rebranded as '''MOR 101.9 My Only Radio For Life!'''.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/video/entertainment/07/07/13/1019-life-launches-new-radio-station-jingle/ 101.9 For Life launches new radio station jingle] ABS-CBN News. Retrieved July 7, 2013</ref> Regular programming began at 5:00am, with Joco Loco, Maki Rena & Eva Ronda  as the first jocks to go on board. DJs from WRR 101.9 For Life! (Toni, China Heart, Reggie Valdez, Martin D. and Geri) were still part of the on-air team, as well as DJs from the former Tambayan 101.9 roster (Charlie, Jasmin, Arnold Rei, Bea, ChaCha (Czarina Marie Balba) and Onse (Nino Tolentino)). The rebranding of this station created a unified brand for [[ABS-CBN]]'s FM radio stations nationwide, which are under the MOR station brand. This also reverts the slogan of the station's second incarnation of \"For Life\" which was first used during the WRR 101.9 For Life! era. At the same time, the station pioneered the face of drama broadcasting on the FM band by launching the daily drama anthology program ''Dear MOR''.\n\nIn June 2018, MOR Manila and its regional stations announced its rebrand as MOR Philippines. The new brand will connect 101.9 and its provincial stations with unified program brands and strong music choices; thus, the new tagline \"One Vibe, One Sound.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abscbnpr.com/mor-stations-nationwide-unite-for-stronger-mor-philippines/|title=MOR stations nationwide unite for stronger MOR Philippines|date=June 1, 2018|website=abscbnpr.com|publisher=abscbnpr.com|language=en-US|access-date=June 3, 2018}}</ref> Under the new system, some of MOR Manila's shows may be converted as national programs; but plans have not yet been discussed at this moment. National programming blocks began in its first phase on August 11, 2018, with the station's launch of Dyis Is It and MOR Presents with David Bang.\n\nOn June 1, 2019, MOR 101.9 video streaming is seen on [[Sky Cable]] Channel 239 replacing [[Sony Channel (Southeast Asia)|Sony Channel Asia]]. It can be seen on Channel 240 (MOR 97.1 Cebu) and Channel 241 (MOR 103.1 Baguio).\n\nOn March 2020, the station implements a scaled-down programming operations due to the present situation and conditions affecting the radio station's staff due to the enhanced quarantine against COVID-19. On the same day, the station begin it's hookup with the sister AM-station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]].\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the station temporarily signed off at exactly 7:52pm after [[TV Patrol]] together with sister stations [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], and [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] due to '''Cease and Desist Order of the [[National Telecommunications Commission]] ordering the network to suspend operations until the legislative license issue is resolved'''.\n\n==Awards==\n* 16th KBP Golden Dove Awardee, '''Best Radio DJ for Martin D.'''\n* 14th KBP Golden Dove Awardee,''' Best 'Variety Show Host for Laila'''.\n* 13th KBP Golden Dove Awardee for '''Outstanding FM Radio Station.'''\n* 13th KBP Golden Dove Awardee for '''Texter's Choice FM Station \u2013 Luzon'''\n* 12th KBP Golden Dove Awardee for '''Best Radio Station.''\n* Recognized as the''' Number 1 Radio Station in Metro Manila''' based on the 2002 KBP-RRC Survey.\n*'''Station of the Year in the 2002''' Dangal ng Pilipinas-Consumer's Choice Awards.\n*'''Best Public Service Ad''' (Pinoy, Ang Galing Mo!) in the 2002 Catholic Mass Media Awards.\n\n==Theme music==\n\n=== As an independent station ===\n*As Radio Romance 101.9, the jingle was composed and sung by [[Jose Mari Chan]], used from November 6, 1995 to April 28, 1996. This theme was later reused - albeit with altered lyrics, by the [[Catholic Media Network]]'s '''Spirit FM''' stations from 2002-2012, sung by local band Tellayouthska.\n*In 1998, the \"For-Life\" jingle was launched. This was sung by [[Jolina Magdangal|Jolina Magdangal-Escueta]] and Jimmy Bondoc. This also had other shorter versions by various recording artists, having used until March 6, 2004. The first verse would later be reused in the current MOR jingle with altered lyrics. A re-hashed version was used from March 7, 2004 to September 18, 2005, performed by [[Heart Evangelista|Heart Evangelista-Escudero]] and [[Erik Santos]]. Even American singer [[Patti Austin]] sang a shorter version of the \"For-Life\" jingle.\n*On September 19, 2005 the station launched a new and hip station jingle courtesy of [[Vhong Navarro]] on vocals using the slogan '''Alam Mo Na 'Yan!''' in the lyrics, used until August 31, 2007.\n*On September 1, 2007, the last \"For-Life\" jingle under the station's independence was launched, composed by [[Raimund Marasigan]] of [[Sandwich (band)|Sandwich]] (former drummer of [[The Eraserheads]]) and interpreted by [[Itchyworms]] and by [[Yeng Constantino|Yeng Constantino-Asuncion]] of ''[[Pinoy Dream Academy]]'', used until September 19, 2009.\n*As Tambayan 101.9, the 1st version jingle was popularized by Skabetche Band and [[Empoy Marquez|Empoy]], used from November 4, 2009 to December 2010.\n*In December 2010, the theme was remixed and sung by the DJs for the station's Christmas 2010 jingle, being used again in Christmas 2011.\n*The 2nd version of the Tambayan jingle, which is a DJ-like mixed jingle, was used by the station from January 2011 to February 14, 2012 which was done by the station's resident DJ Martin D.\n*The 3rd version of the Tambayan jingle was a remix of the 2nd jingle which was heard on the Budots Budots program. This was the jingle used by the station from February 15  to March 4, 2012, hence it was short-lived.\n*The 4th and final version of the Tambayan 101.9 jingle is sung by [[Jovit Baldivino]], [[Yeng Constantino|Yeng Constantino-Asuncion]], [[Gloc-9]] and Phylum Band, and is used from March 5, 2012 to May 17, 2013, when ABS-CBN ended the station's independence for its upcoming MOR branding.\n*The 2nd Tambayan Christmas jingle was sung by [[KZ Tandingan]] featuring Loonie, used from November 24, 2012 to January 6, 2013. This is their last Christmas jingle under the station's independence.\n\n=== As an MOR station ===\n*On July 8, 2013, together with the rebranding of the station to MOR, a new jingle & music video was launched on [[ASAP (TV program)|ASAP 18]] and was performed by various artists. The current version of the new jingle was recorded by [[Toni Gonzaga|Toni Gonzaga-Soriano]], [[Vice Ganda]], and [[Daniel Padilla]]; and was adopted by all MOR stations. The jingle was used until August 7, 2016, in favor of a romance-themed version recorded by [[Bailey May]] and [[Ylona Garcia]] and used extensively on the Manila station from the day after, with provincial stations using it on an occasional basis; yet the management reverted to the original 2013 version of the jingle by June 4, 2017, with the newer rendition being used only as an alternate. Portions of the jingle contain elements from the first For Life jingle for its first verse with altered lyrics and the pre-2013 MOR jingle when it was a group of regional stations. On July 21, 2018, with the upcoming relaunch as MOR Philippines, a new network jingle was introduced during its Pinoy Music Awards, combining the 2013 jingle with David Bang's MOR regional stingers.

DWRR-FM is operated by the Manila Radio division and the [[Star Cinema|Star Creatives Group]]. It is the number 1 FM radio station in Metro Manila, Mega Manila as well as the entire Philippines according to KBP Radio Research Council.<ref>https://radioonlinenow.com/tag/kbp-radio-research-council/</ref>\n\nIt was founded in 1956 as one of the radio stations of Chronicle Broadcasting Network (ABS-CBN). It was revived in 1986 and reformatted several times, it is broadcast live throughout the [[Philippines|Philippine]] archipelago, and throughout the world via [[The Filipino Channel]] (TFC). The studios are located at [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]], Sgt. Esguerra Ave., corner Mo. Ignacia Ave., Diliman, [[Quezon City]] and its 22.5 [[kilowatt|kW]] FM stereo transmitter is located at the Eugenio Lopez Center, Barangay Sta. Cruz, Sumulong Highway, [[Antipolo|Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]].\n\nAs of May 5, 2020, the station's broadcasting activities, together with that of its televsion and sister radio stations, are suspended following the cease-and-desist order issued by the [[National Telecommunications Commission]] due to the expiration of ABS-CBN's legislative license to operate.\n\n==History==\n===DZYL-FM/DZYK-FM/DZMM-FM (1956\u20131972)===<!-- NO NEED to specify the whole name. Same as the others below. -->\nDZYL-FM 102&nbsp;MHz, later named DZYK-FM 102.1&nbsp;MHz, is the first FM radio station in the Philippines and sole FM station of the former Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). DZYK-FM was founded in 1956 and played the latest pop songs of that time. In 1957, CBN bought Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) resulting in a merger under the name Bolinao Electronics Corporation, later named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967. Staffed by eight DJs, DZYK-FM 102.1&nbsp;MHz was popularized to listeners in [[Metro Manila|Greater Manila]] area. DZYK-FM remained as the FM radio station of ABS-CBN until the station was forced off the air by [[Ferdinand Marcos]] under martial law. In 1968, DZYK-FM moved to its current permanent frequency of 101.9&nbsp;MHz, and changed its call letters to DZMM-FM.\n\n===DWWK-FM/OK 101 (1973\u20131986)===\nWhen [[martial law]] was declared in 1972, DZMM-FM along with ABS-CBN's two TV channels and six AM radio stations in Manila were shut down under strict [[censorship]]. The FM station was taken over by Roberto Benedicto and changed to DWOK-FM (as OK 101.9) of the [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]], which had aired in 1973 as DWWK, a jazz format radio station. It was staffed by Jing Magsaysay, Wayne Enage, Ed Picson, Dody Lacuna, Ronnie Malig, Pinky Villarama and Ronnie Quintos. DWOK trailblazed another first  in the Philippine radio industry at that time as the first AM-formatted FM station which features news, public service programs, and music from the 1950s to the 1970s.  [[Helen Vela]] also came to the station in 1984 with her counselling program ''[[Lovingly Yours, Helen]]''. However, DWOK, [[DWAN-AM|DWAN]] (formerly known as DWWA) and BBC-2 had been dissolved since the government-controlled radio and TV stations were stormed by reformist rebels. It was given back to ABS-CBN after the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]], and returned on the air as DWKO \u2014 at that time it was on test broadcast.\n\n===Knock Out Radio (1986\u20131987)===\nThe fall of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos Regime]] in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution had paved the way for the return of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] in the Philippine broadcasting scene. In July 1986, then newly formed Presidential Commission on Good Governance turned two radio stations, DWWW (under 630 kHz) and DWOK-FM, over to ABS-CBN from Marcos ally Roberto Benedicto. DWOK (the former FM station of Benedicto-owned Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation) changed its callsign to DWKO and resumed broadcasting four months later. Lito Balquiedra Jr., Vice-President for Radio, spearheaded the return of the giant network to the local broadcasting scene. The station's former disc jockey [[Peter Musngi]] (then known as Peter Rabbit has worked Knock-Out Radio 101.9 and Zoo FM 101.9) has been the network's voice-over since the reopening in 1986. The slogan of the station was \"Panalo Ka Talaga!\", voiced by Peter Musngi.\n\nThe network started recruiting both experienced and new employees and DJs. Prior to the adoption of [[Mass media|masa]] format, all FM stations are English based with the use of the English language during the 1980s and 1990s. After days of careful planning and almost three months of test broadcast which took place on July 16 that year along with sister stations [[DZMM-AM|DZMM 630]] (which it began broadcasting the following week) and the parent station [[DWWX-TV|ABS-CBN Channel 2]] (which it began broadcasting in September of the same year), DWKO was born \u2013 the first ever FM radio station with an AM format, carrying the name '''Knock-Out Radio 101.9''' on September 14, 1986 (the same day the re-airing of ABS-CBN on channel 2) and playing the hits during that time. Since then, KO-Radio has aired Pinoy hits from singers of the 1970s and 1980s such as [[Rico J. Puno]], [[Yoyoy Villame]], [[APO Hiking Society]]. The station also debuted the songs of [[Original Pilipino Music]] (OPM) stars like [[Gary Valenciano|Gary V]], [[Regine Velasquez]], [[Janno Gibbs]] and [[Donna Cruz]], as well as Filipino Christmas songs. DWKO-FM ended its broadcast on February 28, 1987, and became one of the shortest lived iteration aired on the station in a span of almost 5 months.\n\nDuring that time, the station operated daily from 05:00 AM to 02:00 AM.\n\n===Zoo FM (1987\u20131989)===\nOn March 1, 1987 (following ''The Star Network'' era), the station reformatted as '''Zoo FM 101.9''' (DZOO-FM; read as D-Z-double O-FM), which is best known for its diamond logo and a slightly uptrend pop sound led to the introduction of OPM and [[disco]] hits. The jingles used for the station back then, were produced by [[JAM Creative Productions]]. Manned by a group of eight DJs (most notably, George Boone, Jeremiah Jr., Bob Curry, Bill O'Brien, and Andy Santillan, aka Dave Ryan, later known as \"The Unbeatable\"), the slogan of the station was ''Hayop Talaga!''. It also served as the home of OPM stars like [[Gary Valenciano|Gary V]], [[Randy Santiago]], [[Regine Velasquez]], [[Ogie Alcasid]], [[Sharon Cuneta]], and others. Due to its popularity, Zoo FM 101.9 heavily played OPM songs after the implementation of [http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1987/eo_255_1987.html Executive Order No. 255] by President [[Corazon Aquino]] and became a trend among listeners, because Zoo FM is being competed with other FM stations such as The Giant 97.1 WLS-FM (now [[DWLS|Barangay LS 97.1]]), 99.5 RT (now [[DWRT-FM|99.5 Play FM]]), [[DWTM|Magic 89.9]], [[DZMZ|89 DMZ]] (now [[DWAV|Wave 89.1]]), [[NU 107]] (now [[DWNU|Wish 1075]]) and more. But because of a massive competition from the rival WLS, Zoo FM decided to end its broadcast, having faltered from WLS's dominant listener ratings (and with GMA-7's TV ratings uprisings, despite the uprising being cut short in 1988 by the resurgence of ABS-CBN and the network being catapulted to first place in the TV industry) in January 1989. Two years later, DZOO-FM ended its broadcast on the night of July 31, 1989 (at 11:00 pm). Listeners and DJs bade goodbye to Zoo FM which gave its final broadcast, and with the last song, \"Farewell\" by [[Raymond Lauchengco]].\n\n===Radio Romance (1989\u20131996)===\nOn the morning of August 1, 1989 (at 6:00 am), it reformatted again and this time it became popularly known as '''101.9 Radio Romance''', hence the initials RR, playing all easy-listening love songs manned by all-female jocks such as [[Amy Perez]] (fewer male jocks are also added), and also became the first FM station, whose musical playlists were originated from [[Audio CD|compact discs]] (a technological innovation then). That year also signaled the station's first nationwide reach when [[DZRR|103.1 MHz Baguio]] simulcasted its signals, ensuring travelers from Manila to as far north as Ilocos Sur, uninterrupted listening of its programs, until it eventually simulcasted via satellite to other stations across the country in the early '90s. At the same time, OPM songs are also played on DWRR to produce its weekend OPM program every Sunday.\n\n\"Radio Romance\" became a title of the movie and a theme song of the station composed by [[Jose Mari Chan]] during its popularity. On April 28, 1996 Radio Romance signed-off due to its station reformat.\n\n===WRR 101.9 (1996\u20132009)===\nOn April 29, 1996, DWRR relaunched itself into a [[Middle of the road (music)|mainstream pop]] music station branded '''WRR 101.9''' and it became the first FM radio station to be fully broadcast in [[Filipino language]] in order to compete with rival English-language FM stations such as [[GMA Network]]'s [[DWLS|Campus Radio 97.1 WLS]], [[DWTM|Magic 89.9]] and [[DWRT-FM|99.5 RT]]. Before the end of that year, all ABS-CBN FM stations started to broadcast in their native languages switching from English. Initially, its slogan was ''All the Hits, All the Time!''. On November 2, 1998, WRR adapted the tagline ''For Life!'' (which is based from a [[DYLS-FM|co-owned station]] in Cebu), giving life to listeners with entertainment. In late 1999, DWRR transmitting equipment moved from ABS-CBN Broadcast Center which was used before martial law to the new transmitter tower at the Eugenio Lopez Center in Antipolo City due to the upgrading of the [[Millennium Transmitter]].\n\nIn July 2005, the WRR brand was dropped from the name and adapted the slogan ''Alam Mo Na 'Yan!'' (You Already Know It!), lasting from July 2005 to October 2008. In November 2008, the station changed its slogan to ''Bespren!'' (Bestfriend!).\n\nThe station had its last broadcast under the 101.9 For Life! brand on September 19, 2009 and underwent a transition period playing automated music in preparation for a relaunch of DWRR-FM's new branding on October 1, 2009. However, due to the onslaught of Typhoon [[Typhoon Ketsana|Ondoy (Ketsana)]] in Manila, the station rebrand was postponed for almost a month. For the time being, DWRR-FM temporarily went under the name \"ABS-CBN 101.9 FM\" or simply \"101.9\".\n\nThe postponed relaunch was set on November 4, 2009. Prior to the announcement of the launch date, the station's DJs began providing live spiels again every top of the hour since October 12. But as part of the ongoing transition, the jocks never mentioned its former brand or slogan & the format of the station's SMS syntax except the text hotline itself.\n\n===Tambayan (2009\u20132013)===\n[[File:Tambayan1019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The former logo of Tambayan 101.9 from November 4, 2009-May 2013.]]\n[[File:DWRR-FM101.9Logos.png|thumb|right|200px|Some logos used in Tambayan TV when the station was named as 101.9]]\n\nOn November 4, 2009 at 9:00pm, there was a broadcast about the history of DWRR. Following that, the station was relaunched as '''Tambayan 101.9''' (''tambayan'' is the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for ''hangout'') starting with the theme song & live debut at a venue in Makati. Tambayan launched its [[video streaming]] called Tambayan TV where DJs are seen live from the booth. In between songs playing, some information plugs were seen (such as Tambayan's Slumbook). Just like DZMM Teleradyo, plugs were also aired during commercial gaps. Tambayan TV is aired 24 hours over the Internet.\n\nThe station was also launched via [[HD Radio]] technology.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20091104-234254/New-name-direction-Tambayan-1019 |title=New name, direction: Tambayan 101.9 \u2013 INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos.

(2013\u2013present)===\n[[File:MOR1019logo2014.png|thumb|right|200px|The former logo of MOR 101.9 from January 1, 2014 up to 2017.]]\nOn July 8, 2013 at midnight, 101.9 FM rebranded as '''MOR 101.9 My Only Radio For Life!'''.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/video/entertainment/07/07/13/1019-life-launches-new-radio-station-jingle/ 101.9 For Life launches new radio station jingle] ABS-CBN News. Retrieved July 7, 2013</ref> Regular programming began at 5:00am, with Joco Loco, Maki Rena & Eva Ronda  as the first jocks to go on board. DJs from WRR 101.9 For Life! (Toni, China Heart, Reggie Valdez, Martin D. and Geri) were still part of the on-air team, as well as DJs from the former Tambayan 101.9 roster (Charlie, Jasmin, Arnold Rei, Bea, ChaCha (Czarina Marie Balba) and Onse (Nino Tolentino)). The rebranding of this station created a unified brand for [[ABS-CBN]]'s FM radio stations nationwide, which are under the MOR station brand. This also reverts the slogan of the station's second incarnation of \"For Life\" which was first used during the WRR 101.9 For Life! era. At the same time, the station pioneered the face of drama broadcasting on the FM band by launching the daily drama anthology program ''Dear MOR''.\n\nIn June 2018, MOR Manila and its regional stations announced its rebrand as MOR Philippines. The new brand will connect 101.9 and its provincial stations with unified program brands and strong music choices; thus, the new tagline \"One Vibe, One Sound.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abscbnpr.com/mor-stations-nationwide-unite-for-stronger-mor-philippines/|title=MOR stations nationwide unite for stronger MOR Philippines|date=June 1, 2018|website=abscbnpr.com|publisher=abscbnpr.com|language=en-US|access-date=June 3, 2018}}</ref> Under the new system, some of MOR Manila's shows may be converted as national programs; but plans have not yet been discussed at this moment. National programming blocks began in its first phase on August 11, 2018, with the station's launch of Dyis Is It and MOR Presents with David Bang.\n\nOn June 1, 2019, MOR 101.9 video streaming is seen on [[Sky Cable]] Channel 239 replacing [[Sony Channel (Southeast Asia)|Sony Channel Asia]]. It can be seen on Channel 240 (MOR 97.1 Cebu) and Channel 241 (MOR 103.1 Baguio).\n\nOn March 2020, the station implements a scaled-down programming operations due to the present situation and conditions affecting the radio station's staff due to the enhanced quarantine against COVID-19. On the same day, the station begin it's hookup with the sister AM-station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]].\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the station temporarily signed off at exactly 7:52pm after [[TV Patrol]] together with sister stations [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], and [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] due to '''Cease and Desist Order of the [[National Telecommunications Commission]] ordering the network to suspend operations until the legislative license issue is resolved'''.\n\n==Awards==\n* 16th KBP Golden Dove Awardee, '''Best Radio DJ for Martin D.'''\n* 14th KBP Golden Dove Awardee,''' Best 'Variety Show Host for Laila'''.\n* 13th KBP Golden Dove Awardee for '''Outstanding FM Radio Station.'''\n* 13th KBP Golden Dove Awardee for '''Texter's Choice FM Station \u2013 Luzon'''\n* 12th KBP Golden Dove Awardee for '''Best Radio Station.''\n* Recognized as the''' Number 1 Radio Station in Metro Manila''' based on the 2002 KBP-RRC Survey.\n*'''Station of the Year in the 2002''' Dangal ng Pilipinas-Consumer's Choice Awards.\n*'''Best Public Service Ad''' (Pinoy, Ang Galing Mo!) in the 2002 Catholic Mass Media Awards.\n\n==Theme music==\n\n=== As an independent station ===\n*As Radio Romance 101.9, the jingle was composed and sung by [[Jose Mari Chan]], used from November 6, 1995 to April 28, 1996. This theme was later reused - albeit with altered lyrics, by the [[Catholic Media Network]]'s '''Spirit FM''' stations from 2002-2012, sung by local band Tellayouthska.\n*In 1998, the \"For-Life\" jingle was launched. This was sung by [[Jolina Magdangal|Jolina Magdangal-Escueta]] and Jimmy Bondoc. This also had other shorter versions by various recording artists, having used until March 6, 2004. The first verse would later be reused in the current MOR jingle with altered lyrics. A re-hashed version was used from March 7, 2004 to September 18, 2005, performed by [[Heart Evangelista|Heart Evangelista-Escudero]] and [[Erik Santos]]. Even American singer [[Patti Austin]] sang a shorter version of the \"For-Life\" jingle.\n*On September 19, 2005 the station launched a new and hip station jingle courtesy of [[Vhong Navarro]] on vocals using the slogan '''Alam Mo Na 'Yan!''' in the lyrics, used until August 31, 2007.\n*On September 1, 2007, the last \"For-Life\" jingle under the station's independence was launched, composed by [[Raimund Marasigan]] of [[Sandwich (band)|Sandwich]] (former drummer of [[The Eraserheads]]) and interpreted by [[Itchyworms]] and by [[Yeng Constantino|Yeng Constantino-Asuncion]] of ''[[Pinoy Dream Academy]]'', used until September 19, 2009.\n*As Tambayan 101.9, the 1st version jingle was popularized by Skabetche Band and [[Empoy Marquez|Empoy]], used from November 4, 2009 to December 2010.\n*In December 2010, the theme was remixed and sung by the DJs for the station's Christmas 2010 jingle, being used again in Christmas 2011.\n*The 2nd version of the Tambayan jingle, which is a DJ-like mixed jingle, was used by the station from January 2011 to February 14, 2012 which was done by the station's resident DJ Martin D.\n*The 3rd version of the Tambayan jingle was a remix of the 2nd jingle which was heard on the Budots Budots program. This was the jingle used by the station from February 15  to March 4, 2012, hence it was short-lived.\n*The 4th and final version of the Tambayan 101.9 jingle is sung by [[Jovit Baldivino]], [[Yeng Constantino|Yeng Constantino-Asuncion]], [[Gloc-9]] and Phylum Band, and is used from March 5, 2012 to May 17, 2013, when ABS-CBN ended the station's independence for its upcoming MOR branding.\n*The 2nd Tambayan Christmas jingle was sung by [[KZ Tandingan]] featuring Loonie, used from November 24, 2012 to January 6, 2013. This is their last Christmas jingle under the station's independence.\n\n=== As an MOR station ===\n*On July 8, 2013, together with the rebranding of the station to MOR, a new jingle & music video was launched on [[ASAP (TV program)|ASAP 18]] and was performed by various artists. The current version of the new jingle was recorded by [[Toni Gonzaga|Toni Gonzaga-Soriano]], [[Vice Ganda]], and [[Daniel Padilla]]; and was adopted by all MOR stations. The jingle was used until August 7, 2016, in favor of a romance-themed version recorded by [[Bailey May]] and [[Ylona Garcia]] and used extensively on the Manila station from the day after, with provincial stations using it on an occasional basis; yet the management reverted to the original 2013 version of the jingle by June 4, 2017, with the newer rendition being used only as an alternate. Portions of the jingle contain elements from the first For Life jingle for its first verse with altered lyrics and the pre-2013 MOR jingle when it was a group of regional stations.
