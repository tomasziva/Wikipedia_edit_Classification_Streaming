Goeken]], and operated under the names ''Airfone'', ''GTE Airfone'', and [[Verizon]] Airfone. Airfone allowed passengers to make telephone calls (later including data modem service) in-flight. Airfone handsets were often located in the middle airliner seatbacks, with two handsets per row for 6-wide coach seating configurations, and more or less depending on the aircraft layout and fare class. First class cabins typically had one handset per seat. Some planes had one or more bulkhead mounted phone stations with cordless handsets that the passengers could use, instead of the multiple wired handsets.  Airfone phone calls were usually quite expensive compared to ground-based telephone calls, costing $3.99 per call and $4.99 per minute in 2006.\n\nThe original Airfone main office and [[network operations center]] are located at 2809 Butterfield Rd, Oak Brook, Illinois. The [[network operations center]] remains at this location.<ref>[https://local.google.com/maps?q=Airfone+IL&hl=en&ll=41.842791,-87.987614&spn=0.011669,0.024054&sll=27.698638,-83.804601&sspn=14.175034,24.631348&hq=Airfone&hnear=Illinois&t=m&z=16 Airfone map location.]</ref>\n\n[[Bell Mobility]] used the Airfone technology on [[Air Canada]] flights, but branded its service as Skytel (no relation to the Verizon-owned paging firm of the same name).\n\n== Use==\nCalls were often discounted or free for customers of airplane-based catalogs like [[Sky Mall]], and [[Verizon Wireless]] subscribers could pay $10 per month and 10 cents a call or a flat 69 cents per call with no monthly fee. Airfone could be used for very slow modem calls, and attempts at data service were made in 2003 and 2004 using an on-board email proxy server.\n\nMany of the in-flight calls made by victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] were made over Airfone and Air One.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/ |title=Complete 9/11 Commission Report |date=2004 |author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\nAirfone's primary competitor was Air One, operated by [[AT&T Wireless]] division Claircom Communications Group, and was available onboard [[American Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and select [[Delta Air Lines]] aircraft.
