Webley produced [[handgun]]s and [[long gun]]s from 1834 to 1979, when the company ceased to manufacture firearms and instead focused on producing [[air pistol]]s and [[air rifle]]s. In 2010 Webley & Scott restarted the production of [[shotgun]]s for commercial sale.\n\nWebley is famous for the [[Webley Revolver|revolver]]s and [[Semi-automatic pistol|automatic pistol]]s it supplied to the [[British Empire]]'s military, particularly the [[British Army]], from 1887 through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Webley company was founded in the late 18th century by William Davies, who made bullet moulds.  It was taken over in 1834 by his son-in-law, Philip Webley, who began producing [[percussion cap|percussion]] sporting guns.  The manufacture of revolvers, for which the firm became famous, began twenty years later.  At that time the company was named '''P. Webley & Son'''. In 1897 Webley amalgamated with W & C Scott and Sons to become '''The Webley & Scott Revolver and Arms Company Ltd of Birmingham'''.\n\nWebley's revolvers became the official British sidearm in 1887, remaining in British service until 1964. After 1921, however, Webley service revolvers were manufactured by the government-owned [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]].\n\nIn 1932 the [[Enfield No. 2|Enfield No.2]] .38&nbsp;inch calibre revolver, became the standard British service revolver. However, wartime shortages ensured that all marks of the Webley, including models in .455 and .38/200, remained in use through World War Two. The .455 Mk.VI was declared obsolete in 1945 but the .38 Mk.IV remained in service as a substitute standard weapon into the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1920 the passing of the [[Firearms Act]] in the UK, which limited the availability of handguns to civilians, caused their sales to plummet.  As a result, the company began producing [[Air gun|pneumatic guns]], their first being the '''Mark I air pistol'''.\n\nDemand for air guns increased rapidly in the 1920s and Webley's business began to grow again, with an inevitable peak related to weapons supply for British military use during the Second World War.  Declining sales led to the decision to give up firearms manufacture completely in 1979, however air gun production at the Birmingham factory continued until 22 December 2005, when the company closed down. Webley's dependent company - Venom Custom Shop - ceased trading as well. It was then bought by [[Wolverhampton]]-based company Airgunsport. At this time Airgunsport relocated the manufacture of all Webley guns to Turkey.\n\nWebley & Scott Ltd is owned by both the Fuller Group and John Bright. John Bright is also co-owner of Highland Outdoors Limited who are the UK distributors for Webley, Webley & Scott and AGS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highlandoutdoors.co.uk/|title=Highland Outdoors Limited - Wholesale Suppliers to the Outdoors Trade|website=Highlandoutdoors.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\nUntil 1979 Webley & Scott manufactured [[shotgun]]s and [[revolver]]s for private use, as well as producing sidearms for military and police use.  This came to include both revolvers and self-loading ([[semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]]) [[pistols]].\n\nWebley's production originally consisted of hand-crafted firearms, although mass-production was later introduced to supply police and military buyers.\n\nThe first Webley production revolver appeared in 1853.  Known as the [[Longspur]] it was a muzzle-loaded [[percussion cap]] and ball pistol.  Some consider it to be the finest revolver of its day as it could shoot as fast as the contemporary [[Samuel Colt|Colt]] revolvers and was faster to load.  However the hand-made Longspur could not compete in price with mass-produced revolvers such as the Colt, and production never equalled that of Webley's competitors [[Robert Adams of London|Adams]] ([[Deane, Adams & Deane]]) or [[William Tranter|Tranter]].\n\nWebley's first popular success came with its first [[trigger (firearms)|double-action]] revolver, adopted by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] in 1867.  [[File:Webley 1868 RIC.JPG|thumb|Webley 1868 RIC No. 1 Revolver cal 450 CF]]There is a well-known story that a pair of '''Webley RIC Model''' revolvers were presented to [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Major General]] [[George Armstrong Custer]] by Lord Berkeley in 1869, and it is believed that General Custer was using them at the time of his death in the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]].<ref name=\"Heier2009\">{{cite book|last=Heier|first=Vincent A.|title=Little Bighorn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EXWNIpFYBQC&pg=PA103|year=2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-7007-5|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThere is some question whether the gun or guns presented to George Armstrong Custer were Webley RIC\u2019s. \nOther sources indicate that Lord Berkeley Paget presented Custer with a Galand & Sommerville 44 calibre revolver (manufactured in England by the firm of Braendlin & Sommerville) and gave another to Tom Custer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westernerspublications.ltd.uk/CAGB%20Guns%20at%20the%20LBH.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908225428/http://www.westernerspublications.ltd.uk/CAGB%20Guns%20at%20the%20LBH.htm |archive-date=2006-09-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Of course, it is possible that Lord Berkeley Paget may have given Custer two revolvers, both a Galand & Sommerville and a Webley RIC or even given the Custer brothers, in some combination, a pair of Webley RICs and a pair of Galand & Sommervilles. A cased Galand & Sommerville revolver certainly formed part of Tom Custer\u2019s estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/in_another_time/040295.html|title=Utah History to Go|website=Historytogo.utah.gov|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref> Galand & Sommerville 44 revolvers were made to use the same ammunition as the first Webley RIC\u2019s, i.e. Webley's .442 centre-fire cartridge.\n\nAlmost all of Webley's subsequent revolvers were of a [[top-break]] design.  A pivoting lever on the side of the gun's upper receiver was pressed to release the barrel and cylinder assembly, which then tilts up and forward on a bottom-front pivot. After loading, the assembly is tilted back into firing position and locked closed.  [[File:WebleyBBD.JPG|thumb|<center>Webley \"The British Bull Dog\" Revolver <br> cal 450 CF - 1870s</center>]]\n\nWebley went on to produce more revolvers for the civilian market. Webley's popular pocket revolver, '''The British Bull Dog''', was developed in 1872, available in .44 Short Rimfire, .442 and .450 calibers, and widely exported and copied.   Smaller scale versions in .320 and .380 calibers were added later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww3.phelbs.com/|title=phelbs.com - Diese Website steht zum Verkauf! - Informationen zum Thema phelbs.|website=3.phelbs.com|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough often attributed to Webley, Webley only produced some of the revolvers now commonly referred to as '''Webley .577 Boxer Revolvers''', which used the most powerful handgun cartridge of the day, the [[.577 Boxer]]. It was produced by Webley under licence from the firm of [[William Tranter]] of Birmingham, whose design it actually was. Webley was just one of several firms licensed to use Tranter's double-action lock and particularly Tranter's patented revolving recoil shield, which was a key feature of the early .577 calibre revolvers.<ref name=\"Kinard2004\">{{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|title=Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA140|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-470-7|page=140}}</ref>\n\nIn 1879 Webley developed & sold commercially a rugged and powerful revolver intended for the British military, the WG or Webley Government in .455/.476, the WG's cylinder was long enough for .44 Russian & .45 Colt length rounds [Jim Farmer has seen .45 Colt chambered WG models, but is unsure if they were converted .455s- further research is needed for WG chamberings- he has seen Belgian WG copies made in .44-40].

This pistol had a 3.5\" barrel and an 8-round magazine.  A .25 (6.35&nbsp;mm) version had a 3-inch barrel and a 6-round magazine.  Ultimately pistols were produced in a range of bores from .22&nbsp;inch to .455&nbsp;inch, and included 9&nbsp;mm models.  Webley self-loaders were simple, [[single-action]] [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback]] pistols, designed by William Whiting.  Production ceased in 1940.\n\nIn 1905, Webley had presented an auto-loading pistol for testing by the [[Small Arms Committee]] (SAC), a [[United Kingdom|British]] military group charged with organizing trials and making recommendations of arms to the [[War Office]].  The SAC, which had begun testing automatics in 1900, was unimpressed by Webley's offering, preferring foreign automatics including the [[Samuel Colt|Colt]].  However no automatic was recommended over contemporary service [[revolver]]s, which were all Webleys at the time, and trials would continue until 1913.\n\nIn 1910 Webley offered a new automatic for testing, and in 1911 the [[Webley Self-Loading Pistol|Webley self-loading .455-inch Mark I]] was recommended by both the SAC and the Chief Inspector of Small Arms (CISA.)  This pistol was adopted by the [[Royal Navy]] in early 1912 as the first automatic pistol officially in British service.  Later the pistol was also adopted by the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] and was issued to members of the [[Royal Flying Corps]].\n\nThe Webley & Scott self-loading .455 inch pistol had a 7-round magazine. It was not a small pistol, rugged and accurate at short range, but also heavy with an awkward grip angle.  It was prone to jamming throughout most of its service career, owing largely to its [[cordite]] ammunition, which left residue that fouled the close tolerances of its diagonally locking breech. The problem was officially resolved in 1941 with the introduction of the Mark Iz ([[nitrocellulose]]) cartridge.\n\nThe first examples of the pistol had the safety on left side of the hammer, but later models moved the safety to the left side of the frame, where it could also lock the slide. A grip safety was provided on the military models. The pistol had dual ejectors.  The slide stop was activated by the absence of a cartridge in the feedway, not by the magazine follower as in most automatics. A drift-adjustable rear sight had range-hashmarks in [[micrometer]]s.\n\nAlthough never officially adopted by the British Army, Webley self-loaders were widely used as a substitute-standard or personal weapons by British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces in both World Wars. Versions were also marketed to [[Colonialism|colonial]] military and police forces and were widely adopted.\n\nThe [[Webley & Scott  1906|1906 Webley & Scott Self Loading Pistol]] in .32 ACP was adopted by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|London Metropolitan Police]] in 1911, and is sometimes referred to as the Webley MP for this reason.  It officially replaced the bulldog revolvers then in use following the infamous [[Siege of Sidney Street]] in 1911.\n\n==Webley & Scott flare pistols==\n[[File:Webley No 1 Mk 1 flare pistol at NFM.JPG|thumb|left|No.1 Mk 1 Flare Pistol on display at the National Firearms Museum]]\n[[File:Webley & Scott Mk III flare pistol.jpg|thumb|1918 MkIII flare pistol]]\nWebley & Scott produced a number of single-shot, break open signal [[flare gun]] devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. The most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company's Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in [[Sydney, Australia]] in 1942. Perhaps the most famous example of a No.1 Mk 1 Flare Pistol is in the collection at the [http://www.manl.nf.ca/index.php/newfoundland-labrador-museums/regional-listings/avalon/conception-bay-museum.html/ Conception Bay Museum], Harbour Grace, NL. The gun was lent by Edward Langdon Oke, IV, a veteran of WW1 and the then editor of the Harbor Grace Standard newspaper, to the first Canadian to make a transatlantic flight, Capt. [[J. Errol Boyd]] (1891-1960).  Boyd took off 9 Oct 1930 from the Harbour Grace airstrip in the plane Maple Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by Lieut. Harry Connor, and landed 10 Oct in Tresco, Scilly Isles, England.  The gun was engraved to mark the historic flight and is also tatted with the owner\u2019s initials.

Webley produced [[handgun]]s and [[long gun]]s from 1834 to 1979, when the company ceased to manufacture firearms and instead focused on producing [[air pistol]]s and [[air rifle]]s. In 2010 Webley & Scott restarted the production of [[shotgun]]s for commercial sale.\n\nWebley is famous for the [[Webley Revolver|revolver]]s and [[Semi-automatic pistol|automatic pistol]]s it supplied to the [[British Empire]]'s military, particularly the [[British Army]], from 1887 through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Webley company was founded in the late 18th century by William Davies, who made bullet moulds.  It was taken over in 1834 by his son-in-law, Philip Webley, who began producing [[percussion cap|percussion]] sporting guns.  The manufacture of revolvers, for which the firm became famous, began twenty years later.  At that time the company was named '''P. Webley & Son'''. In 1897 Webley amalgamated with W & C Scott and Sons to become '''The Webley & Scott Revolver and Arms Company Ltd of Birmingham'''.\n\nWebley's revolvers became the official British sidearm in 1887, remaining in British service until 1964. After 1921, however, Webley service revolvers were manufactured by the government-owned [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]].\n\nIn 1932 the [[Enfield No. 2|Enfield No.2]] .38&nbsp;inch calibre revolver, became the standard British service revolver. However, wartime shortages ensured that all marks of the Webley, including models in .455 and .38/200, remained in use through World War Two. The .455 Mk.VI was declared obsolete in 1945 but the .38 Mk.IV remained in service as a substitute standard weapon into the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1920 the passing of the [[Firearms Act]] in the UK, which limited the availability of handguns to civilians, caused their sales to plummet.  As a result, the company began producing [[Air gun|pneumatic guns]], their first being the '''Mark I air pistol'''.\n\nDemand for air guns increased rapidly in the 1920s and Webley's business began to grow again, with an inevitable peak related to weapons supply for British military use during the Second World War.  Declining sales led to the decision to give up firearms manufacture completely in 1979, however air gun production at the Birmingham factory continued until 22 December 2005, when the company closed down. Webley's dependent company - Venom Custom Shop - ceased trading as well. It was then bought by [[Wolverhampton]]-based company Airgunsport. At this time Airgunsport relocated the manufacture of all Webley guns to Turkey.\n\nWebley & Scott Ltd is owned by both the Fuller Group and John Bright. John Bright is also co-owner of Highland Outdoors Limited who are the UK distributors for Webley, Webley & Scott and AGS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highlandoutdoors.co.uk/|title=Highland Outdoors Limited - Wholesale Suppliers to the Outdoors Trade|website=Highlandoutdoors.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\nUntil 1979 Webley & Scott manufactured [[shotgun]]s and [[revolver]]s for private use, as well as producing sidearms for military and police use.  This came to include both revolvers and self-loading ([[semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]]) [[pistols]].\n\nWebley's production originally consisted of hand-crafted firearms, although mass-production was later introduced to supply police and military buyers.\n\nThe first Webley production revolver appeared in 1853.  Known as the [[Longspur]] it was a muzzle-loaded [[percussion cap]] and ball pistol.  Some consider it to be the finest revolver of its day as it could shoot as fast as the contemporary [[Samuel Colt|Colt]] revolvers and was faster to load.  However the hand-made Longspur could not compete in price with mass-produced revolvers such as the Colt, and production never equalled that of Webley's competitors [[Robert Adams of London|Adams]] ([[Deane, Adams & Deane]]) or [[William Tranter|Tranter]].\n\nWebley's first popular success came with its first [[trigger (firearms)|double-action]] revolver, adopted by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] in 1867.  [[File:Webley 1868 RIC.JPG|thumb|Webley 1868 RIC No. 1 Revolver cal 450 CF]]There is a well-known story that a pair of '''Webley RIC Model''' revolvers were presented to [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Major General]] [[George Armstrong Custer]] by Lord Berkeley in 1869, and it is believed that General Custer was using them at the time of his death in the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]].<ref name=\"Heier2009\">{{cite book|last=Heier|first=Vincent A.|title=Little Bighorn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EXWNIpFYBQC&pg=PA103|year=2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-7007-5|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThere is some question whether the gun or guns presented to George Armstrong Custer were Webley RIC\u2019s. \nOther sources indicate that Lord Berkeley Paget presented Custer with a Galand & Sommerville 44 calibre revolver (manufactured in England by the firm of Braendlin & Sommerville) and gave another to Tom Custer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westernerspublications.ltd.uk/CAGB%20Guns%20at%20the%20LBH.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908225428/http://www.westernerspublications.ltd.uk/CAGB%20Guns%20at%20the%20LBH.htm |archive-date=2006-09-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Of course, it is possible that Lord Berkeley Paget may have given Custer two revolvers, both a Galand & Sommerville and a Webley RIC or even given the Custer brothers, in some combination, a pair of Webley RICs and a pair of Galand & Sommervilles. A cased Galand & Sommerville revolver certainly formed part of Tom Custer\u2019s estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/in_another_time/040295.html|title=Utah History to Go|website=Historytogo.utah.gov|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref> Galand & Sommerville 44 revolvers were made to use the same ammunition as the first Webley RIC\u2019s, i.e. Webley's .442 centre-fire cartridge.\n\nAlmost all of Webley's subsequent revolvers were of a [[top-break]] design.  A pivoting lever on the side of the gun's upper receiver was pressed to release the barrel and cylinder assembly, which then tilts up and forward on a bottom-front pivot. After loading, the assembly is tilted back into firing position and locked closed.  [[File:WebleyBBD.JPG|thumb|<center>Webley \"The British Bull Dog\" Revolver <br> cal 450 CF - 1870s</center>]]\n\nWebley went on to produce more revolvers for the civilian market. Webley's popular pocket revolver, '''The British Bull Dog''', was developed in 1872, available in .44 Short Rimfire, .442 and .450 calibers, and widely exported and copied.   Smaller scale versions in .320 and .380 calibers were added later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww3.phelbs.com/|title=phelbs.com\u00a0-\u00a0Diese Website steht zum Verkauf!\u00a0-\u00a0Informationen zum Thema phelbs.|website=3.phelbs.com|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough often attributed to Webley, Webley only produced some of the revolvers now commonly referred to as '''Webley .577 Boxer Revolvers''', which used the most powerful handgun cartridge of the day, the [[.577 Boxer]]. It was produced by Webley under licence from the firm of [[William Tranter]] of Birmingham, whose design it actually was. Webley was just one of several firms licensed to use Tranter's double-action lock and particularly Tranter's patented revolving recoil shield, which was a key feature of the early .577 calibre revolvers.<ref name=\"Kinard2004\">{{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|title=Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA140|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-470-7|page=140}}</ref>\n\nIn 1879 Webley developed & sold commercially a rugged and powerful revolver intended for the British military, the WG or Webley Government in .455/.476, the WG's cylinder was long enough for .44 Russian & .45 Colt length rounds [Jim Farmer has seen .45 Colt chambered WG models, but is unsure if they were converted .455s- further research is needed for WG chamberings- he has seen Belgian WG copies made in .44-40].

This pistol had a 3.5\" barrel and an 8-round magazine.  A .25 (6.35&nbsp;mm) version had a 3-inch barrel and a 6-round magazine.  Ultimately pistols were produced in a range of bores from .22&nbsp;inch to .455&nbsp;inch, and included 9&nbsp;mm models.  Webley self-loaders were simple, [[single-action]] [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback]] pistols, designed by William Whiting.  Production ceased in 1940.\n\nIn 1905, Webley had presented an auto-loading pistol for testing by the [[Small Arms Committee]] (SAC), a [[United Kingdom|British]] military group charged with organizing trials and making recommendations of arms to the [[War Office]].  The SAC, which had begun testing automatics in 1900, was unimpressed by Webley's offering, preferring foreign automatics including the [[Samuel Colt|Colt]].  However no automatic was recommended over contemporary service [[revolver]]s, which were all Webleys at the time, and trials would continue until 1913.\n\nIn 1910 Webley offered a new automatic for testing, and in 1911 the [[Webley Self-Loading Pistol|Webley self-loading .455-inch Mark I]] was recommended by both the SAC and the Chief Inspector of Small Arms (CISA.)  This pistol was adopted by the [[Royal Navy]] in early 1912 as the first automatic pistol officially in British service.  Later the pistol was also adopted by the [[Royal Horse Artillery]] and was issued to members of the [[Royal Flying Corps]].\n\nThe Webley & Scott self-loading .455 inch pistol had a 7-round magazine. It was not a small pistol, rugged and accurate at short range, but also heavy with an awkward grip angle.  It was prone to jamming throughout most of its service career, owing largely to its [[cordite]] ammunition, which left residue that fouled the close tolerances of its diagonally locking breech. The problem was officially resolved in 1941 with the introduction of the Mark Iz ([[nitrocellulose]]) cartridge.\n\nThe first examples of the pistol had the safety on left side of the hammer, but later models moved the safety to the left side of the frame, where it could also lock the slide. A grip safety was provided on the military models. The pistol had dual ejectors.  The slide stop was activated by the absence of a cartridge in the feedway, not by the magazine follower as in most automatics. A drift-adjustable rear sight had range-hashmarks in [[micrometer]]s.\n\nAlthough never officially adopted by the British Army, Webley self-loaders were widely used as a substitute-standard or personal weapons by British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces in both World Wars. Versions were also marketed to [[Colonialism|colonial]] military and police forces and were widely adopted.\n\nThe [[Webley & Scott  1906|1906 Webley & Scott Self Loading Pistol]] in .32 ACP was adopted by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|London Metropolitan Police]] in 1911, and is sometimes referred to as the Webley MP for this reason.  It officially replaced the bulldog revolvers then in use following the infamous [[Siege of Sidney Street]] in 1911.\n\n==Webley & Scott flare pistols==\n[[File:Webley No 1 Mk 1 flare pistol at NFM.JPG|thumb|left|No.1 Mk 1 Flare Pistol on display at the National Firearms Museum]]\n[[File:Webley & Scott Mk III flare pistol.jpg|thumb|1918 MkIII flare pistol]]\nWebley & Scott produced a number of single-shot, break open signal [[flare gun]] devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. The most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company's Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in [[Sydney, Australia]] in 1942. Perhaps the most famous example of a No.1 Mk 1 Flare Pistol is in the collection at the [http://www.manl.nf.ca/index.php/newfoundland-labrador-museums/regional-listings/avalon/conception-bay-museum.html/ Conception Bay Museum], Harbour Grace, NL. The gun was lent by Edward Langdon Oke, IV, a veteran of WW1 and the then editor of the Harbor Grace Standard newspaper, to the first Canadian to make a transatlantic flight, Capt. [[J. Errol Boyd]] (1891-1960).  Boyd took off 9 Oct 1930 from the Harbour Grace airstrip in the plane Maple Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by Lieut. Harry Connor, and landed 10 Oct in Tresco, Scilly Isles, England.  The gun was engraved to mark the historic flight and is also tatted with the owner\u2019s initials.
