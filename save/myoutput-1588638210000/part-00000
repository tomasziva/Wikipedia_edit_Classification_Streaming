It is widely considered Schubert's most technically demanding composition for the piano. Schubert himself said \"the devil may play it,\" in reference to his own inability to do so properly.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Schubert\n|first=Edmondstoune|last=Duncan\n|publisher=J. M.

It was written for and dedicated to Carl Emanuel Liebenberg von Zsittin, who had studied piano with  [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], in the hope of some remuneration from the dedication.<ref name=\"Einstein\">{{cite book|last=Einstein|first=Alfred|title=Schubert: A Musical Portrait|year=1951|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=204}}</ref> It is not only a technically formidable challenge for the performer, but also a structurally formidable four-movement work combining theme-and-variations with sonata form. Each movement transitions into the next instead of ending with a final definitive cadence, and each starts with a variation of the opening phrase of his [[lied]] \"[[Der Wanderer]]\", D. 489. The second movement, marked \"adagio,\" states the theme in virtually the same way it is presented in the song, whereas the three fast daddy movements begin with variants in [[diminution]] (that is, shortened note values): the first movement, \"allegro con fuoco ma non troppo,\" a monothematic sonata form in which the second theme is another variant, the third, \"presto,\" a scherzo in compound time, and the finale, marked simply \"allegro,\" starting as a quasi-fugue and making increasing demands on the player's technical and interpretive powers as it storms on to its conclusion.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe whole work is based on one single basic [[motive (music)|motive]] from which all  [[theme (music)|themes]] are developed. This motive is distilled from the theme of the [[C-sharp minor]] second movement, which is a sequence of [[variation (music)|variations]] on a melody taken from the lied \"Der Wanderer\", which Schubert wrote in 1816. It is this set of variations from which the work's popular name is derived.\n\nThe four movements are played without a break. After the first movement ''[[tempo (music)|Allegro]] con fuoco ma non troppo'' in C major and the second movement ''[[tempo (music)|Adagio]]'', follow a [[scherzo]] ''[[tempo (music)|presto]]'' in A-flat major and the technically transcendental finale, which starts in fugato returning to the key of C major and becomes more and more virtuosic as it moves toward its thunderous nonfugal conclusion.\n\n== Liszt's transcriptions ==\nThe Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]], who was fascinated by the ''Wanderer Fantasy'', transcribed it for piano and orchestra (S.366) and two pianos (S.653). He additionally edited the original score and added some various interpretations in [[ossia]], and made a complete rearrangement of the final movement (S.565a).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMSLP2|work=Wanderer Fantasy, D.760 (Schubert, Franz)|cname=Wanderer Fantasy}}\n\n{{Schubert piano compositions}}\n{{Portal bar|Classical music}}\n\n[[Category:Piano music by Franz Schubert]]\n[[Category:Compositions for solo piano]]\n[[Category:1822 compositions]]\n[[Category:Fantasias (music)|Schubert]]\n[[Category:Compositions in C major]]\n[[Category:Music with dedications]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Musical composition for piano by Franz Schubert}}\n{{Italic title}}{{listen\n | header      = Performance by Daniel Blanch ([http://www.danielblanch.com/ www.danielblanch.com]) Courtesy of [http://musopen.com Musopen]\n | filename     = Franz Schubert - fantasy in c major op.15 d.760 'wanderer' - i. allegro con fuoco.ogg\n | title        = I.
