These can be set up in preserves, conservation preserves, national forests, national parks and even in urban areas along rivers, [[gulch]]es or otherwise undeveloped areas. Often these areas are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], [[biodiversity]], ecological studies, [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], solitude and [[recreation]].<ref>No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157</ref> They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and provide habitat for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s or [[laboratory|laboratories]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Innoko Wilderness.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Innoko Wilderness]], [[Alaska]] [[United States]] in the [[summer]].]]\n\n===Ancient times and Middle Ages===\nLooked at through the lens of the [[visual arts]], nature and wildness have been important subjects in various epochs of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] occurred in the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618-907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art. Artists in the tradition of [[Shan shui]] (lit. ''mountain-water-picture''), learned to depict mountains and rivers \"from the perspective of nature as a whole and on the basis of their understanding of the laws of nature\u2026 as if seen through the eyes of a bird.\" In the 13th century, Shih Erh Chi recommended avoiding painting \"scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature.\"<ref>[http://www.asia-art.net/chinese_tech_brush.html Chinese brush painting] Asia-art.net Retrieved on: 20 May 2006.</ref>\n\nFor most of [[human history]], the greater part of the Earth's terrain was wilderness, and human attention was concentrated on settled areas. The first known laws to protect parts of nature date back to the Babylonian Empire and Chinese Empire. [[Ashoka]], the Great [[Mauryan]] King, defined the first laws in the world to protect [[flora and fauna]] in [[Edicts of Ashoka]] around 3rd Century B.C. In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] initiated one of the world's first conscious efforts to protect natural areas. They were motivated by a desire to be able to [[Hunting|hunt]] wild animals in private hunting preserves rather than a desire to protect wilderness. Nevertheless, in order to have animals to hunt they would have to protect wildlife from subsistence hunting and the land from villagers gathering firewood.<ref name=\"History\" /> Similar measures were introduced in other European countries.\n\n===19th century to present===\nThe idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the [[Western culture|Western world]] in the 19th century. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Prior to that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth|William Wordsworth's]] poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.<ref name=History>[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Retrieved: 20 May 2006.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, in Germany, \"Scientific Conservation,\" as it was called, advocated \"the efficient utilization of [[natural resources]] through the application of [[science]] and [[technology]].\" Concepts of forest management based on the German approach were applied in other parts of the world, but with varying degrees of success.<ref name=Wilderness>Akamani, K. (nd). [http://www.abetterearth.org/article.php/1346.html \"The Wilderness Idea: A Critical Review.\"] A Better Earth.org. Retrieved: 1 June 2006</ref> Over the course of the 19th century wilderness became viewed not as a place to fear but a place to enjoy and protect, hence came the [[conservation movement]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Rivers were rafted and mountains were climbed solely for the sake of recreation, not to determine their geographical context.\n\nIn 1861, following an intense lobbying by artists (painters), the French Waters and Forests Military Agency set an \u00ab artistic reserve \u00bb in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1 097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve.\n\nGlobal conservation became an issue at the time of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] in [[Africa]] in the late 1940s. The British established great [[Nature reserves|wildlife preserves]] there. As before, this interest in conservation had an economic motive: in this case, [[Big-game hunter|big game hunting]]. Nevertheless, this led to growing recognition in the 1950s and the early 1960s of the need to protect large spaces for wildlife conservation worldwide. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF), founded in 1961, grew to be one of the largest conservation organizations in the world.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nEarly conservationists advocated the creation of a legal mechanism by which boundaries could be set on human activities in order to preserve natural and unique lands for the enjoyment and use of future generations. This profound shift in wilderness thought reached a pinnacle in the US with the passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964, which allowed for parts of [[U.S. National Forest]]s to be designated as \"wilderness preserves\". Similar acts, such as the 1975 [[Eastern Wilderness Act]], followed.\n\nNevertheless, initiatives for wilderness conservation continue to increase. There are a growing number of projects to [[Tropical rainforest conservation|protect tropical rainforests]] through conservation initiatives. There are also large-scale projects to conserve wilderness regions, such as Canada's [[Boreal Forest Conservation Framework]]. The Framework calls for conservation of 50 percent of the 6,000,000 square kilometres of boreal forest in Canada's north.<ref>Canadian Boreal Initiative [http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php Boreal Forest Conservation Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208012102/http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php |date=8 December 2007 }}. www.borealcanada.ca Retrieved on: 1 December 2007.</ref> In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, organizations such as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[WILD Foundation]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Conservation International]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)]] and many others are active in such conservation efforts.\n\nThe 21st century has seen another slight shift in wilderness thought and theory. It is now understood that simply drawing lines around a piece of land and declaring it a wilderness does not necessarily make it a wilderness. All [[landscape]]s are intricately connected and what happens outside a wilderness certainly affects what happens inside it. For example, [[air pollution]] from [[Los Angeles]] and the California Central Valley affects Kern Canyon and [[Sequoia National Park]]. The national park has miles of \"wilderness\" but the air is filled with pollution from the valley. This gives rise to the paradox of what a wilderness really is; a key issue in 21st century wilderness thought.\n\n[[File:Ahja j\u00f5e \u00fcrgorg.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.1|<center>A view of wilderness in Estonia</center>]]\n\n==National parks==\n[[File:El Toro Wilderness.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[El Toro Wilderness]] within the [[Caribbean National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]]]]\nThe creation of [[National Park]]s, beginning in the 19th century, preserved some especially attractive and notable areas, but the pursuits of [[commerce]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], and [[recreation]] combined with increases in [[human population]] have continued to result in human modification of relatively untouched areas. Such human activity often negatively impacts native flora and fauna. As such, to better protect critical habitats and preserve low-impact recreational opportunities, legal concepts of \"wilderness\" were established in many countries, beginning with the United States (see below).\n\nThe first National Park was [[Yellowstone]], which was signed into law by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant on 1 March 1872.<ref>Mangan, E. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/yehtml/yeabout.html Yellowstone, the First National Park] ''Library of Congress,'' Mapping the National Parks. Retrieved on: 2010-08-12.</ref> The Act of Dedication declared Yellowstone a land \"hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Magic of Yellowstone|url=http://www.yellowstone-online.com/history/yhfour.html|work=Congressional Acts Pertaining to Yellowstone|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe world's second national park, the [[Royal National Park]], located just 32&nbsp;km to the south of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], was established in 1879.<ref>New South Wales National Parks & Wildlife Service, ''[http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/parkContent/N0030?OpenDocument&ParkKey=N0030&Type=xo \"Parks & Reserves: Royal National Park\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820034120/http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/parkContent/N0030?OpenDocument&ParkKey=N0030&Type=Xo |date=20 August 2006 }}''. Accessed 6 December 2011.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. concept of national parks soon caught on in [[Canada]], which created [[Banff National Park]] in 1885, at the same time as the transcontinental [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was being built. The creation of this and other parks showed a growing appreciation of wild nature, but also an economic reality. The railways wanted to entice people to travel west. Parks such as Banff and Yellowstone gained favor as the railroads advertised travel to \"the great wild spaces\" of North America. When outdoorsman Teddy Roosevelt became president of the United States, he began to enlarge the U.S. National Parks system, and established the National Forest system.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nBy the 1920s, travel across North America by train to experience the \"wilderness\" (often viewing it only through windows) had become very popular. This led to the commercialization of some of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's National Parks]] with the building of great hotels such as the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]].\n\nDespite their similar name, national parks in [[England and Wales]] are quite different from [[national park]]s in many other countries. Unlike most other countries, in England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership. Each park is operated by its own [[national park authority]].\n\n==Conservation and preservation in 20th century United States==\nBy the later 19th century it had become clear that in many countries wild areas had either disappeared or were in danger of disappearing. This realization gave rise to the [[conservation movement]] in the [[United States]], partly through the efforts of writers and activists such as [[John Burroughs]], [[Aldo Leopold]], and [[John Muir]], and politicians such as [[U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]].\n[[File:Cook Lake Bridger Wilderness.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|Cook Lake in the Bridger Wilderness, [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]], [[Wyoming]], U.S.]]\n\nThe idea of protecting nature for nature's sake began to gain more recognition in the 1930s with American writers like [[Aldo Leopold]], calling for a \"land ethic\" and urging wilderness protection. It had become increasingly clear that wild spaces were disappearing rapidly and that decisive action was needed to save them. Wilderness preservation is central to [[deep ecology]]; a philosophy that believes in an inherent worth of all living beings, regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.<ref name=barry>{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E.

The initial consensus among conservationists was split into \"utilitarian conservationists\" later to be referred to as conservationists, and \"aesthetic conservationists\" or preservationists. The main representative for the former was [[Gifford Pinchot]], first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and they focused on the ''proper use of nature,'' whereas the preservationists sought the ''protection of nature from use.''<ref name=\"Wilderness\" /> Put another way, conservation sought to regulate human use while preservation sought to eliminate human impact altogether.

[[Ashoka]], the Great [[Mauryan]] King, defined the first laws in the world to protect [[flora and fauna]] in [[Edicts of Ashoka]] around 3rd Century B.C. In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] initiated one of the world's first conscious efforts to protect natural areas. They were motivated by a desire to be able to [[Hunting|hunt]] wild animals in private hunting preserves rather than a desire to protect wilderness. Nevertheless, in order to have animals to hunt they would have to protect wildlife from subsistence hunting and the land from villagers gathering firewood.<ref name=\"History\" /> Similar measures were introduced in other European countries.\n\n===19th century to present===\nThe idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the [[Western culture|Western world]] in the 19th century. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Prior to that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings.

The Framework calls for conservation of 50 percent of the 6,000,000 square kilometres of boreal forest in Canada's north.<ref>Canadian Boreal Initiative [http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php Boreal Forest Conservation Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208012102/http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php |date=8 December 2007 }}. www.borealcanada.ca Retrieved on: 1 December 2007.</ref> In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, organizations such as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[WILD Foundation]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Conservation International]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)]] and many others are active in such conservation efforts.\n\nThe 21st century has seen another slight shift in wilderness thought and theory. It is now understood that simply drawing lines around a piece of land and declaring it a wilderness does not necessarily make it a wilderness. All [[landscape]]s are intricately connected and what happens outside a wilderness certainly affects what happens inside it. For example, [[air pollution]] from [[Los Angeles]] and the California Central Valley affects Kern Canyon and [[Sequoia National Park]]. The national park has miles of \"wilderness\" but the air is filled with pollution from the valley. This gives rise to the paradox of what a wilderness really is; a key issue in 21st century wilderness thought.\n\n[[File:Ahja j\u00f5e \u00fcrgorg.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.1|<center>A view of wilderness in Estonia</center>]]\n\n==National parks==\n[[File:El Toro Wilderness.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[El Toro Wilderness]] within the [[Caribbean National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]]]]\nThe creation of [[National Park]]s, beginning in the 19th century, preserved some especially attractive and notable areas, but the pursuits of [[commerce]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], and [[recreation]] combined with increases in [[human population]] have continued to result in human modification of relatively untouched areas. Such human activity often negatively impacts native flora and fauna. As such, to better protect critical habitats and preserve low-impact recreational opportunities, legal concepts of \"wilderness\" were established in many countries, beginning with the United States (see below).\n\nThe first National Park was [[Yellowstone]], which was signed into law by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant on 1 March 1872.<ref>Mangan, E. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/yehtml/yeabout.html Yellowstone, the First National Park] ''Library of Congress,'' Mapping the National Parks.

Accessed 6 December 2011.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. concept of national parks soon caught on in [[Canada]], which created [[Banff National Park]] in 1885, at the same time as the transcontinental [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was being built. The creation of this and other parks showed a growing appreciation of wild nature, but also an economic reality. The railways wanted to entice people to travel west. Parks such as Banff and Yellowstone gained favor as the railroads advertised travel to \"the great wild spaces\" of North America. When outdoorsman Teddy Roosevelt became president of the United States, he began to enlarge the U.S. National Parks system, and established the National Forest system.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nBy the 1920s, travel across North America by train to experience the \"wilderness\" (often viewing it only through windows) had become very popular. This led to the commercialization of some of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's National Parks]] with the building of great hotels such as the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]].\n\nDespite their similar name, national parks in [[England and Wales]] are quite different from [[national park]]s in many other countries. Unlike most other countries, in England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership. Each park is operated by its own [[national park authority]].\n\n==Conservation and preservation in 20th century United States==\nBy the later 19th century it had become clear that in many countries wild areas had either disappeared or were in danger of disappearing. This realization gave rise to the [[conservation movement]] in the [[United States]], partly through the efforts of writers and activists such as [[John Burroughs]], [[Aldo Leopold]], and [[John Muir]], and politicians such as [[U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]].\n[[File:Cook Lake Bridger Wilderness.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|Cook Lake in the Bridger Wilderness, [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]], [[Wyoming]], U.S.]]\n\nThe idea of protecting nature for nature's sake began to gain more recognition in the 1930s with American writers like [[Aldo Leopold]], calling for a \"land ethic\" and urging wilderness protection. It had become increasingly clear that wild spaces were disappearing rapidly and that decisive action was needed to save them. Wilderness preservation is central to [[deep ecology]]; a philosophy that believes in an inherent worth of all living beings, regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.<ref name=barry>{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E.

The initial consensus among conservationists was split into \"utilitarian conservationists\" later to be referred to as conservationists, and \"aesthetic conservationists\" or preservationists. The main representative for the former was [[Gifford Pinchot]], first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and they focused on the ''proper use of nature,'' whereas the preservationists sought the ''protection of nature from use.''<ref name=\"Wilderness\" /> Put another way, conservation sought to regulate human use while preservation sought to eliminate human impact altogether.

For example, [[William Cronon]] writes that what he calls a wilderness ethic or cult may \"teach us to be dismissive or even contemptuous of such humble places and experiences\", and that \"wilderness tends to privilege some parts of nature at the expense of others\", using as an example \"the mighty canyon more inspiring than the humble marsh.\"<ref name=Cronon>[http://history.wisc.edu/cronon/Trouble_with_Wilderness_Main.html The Trouble with Wilderness] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053842/http://history.wisc.edu/cronon/Trouble_with_Wilderness_Main.html |date=27 September 2011 }} University of Wisconsin-Madison. Retrieved: 28 January 2007.</ref> This is most clearly visible with the fact that nearly all U.S. National Parks preserve spectacular canyons and mountains, and it was not until the 1940s that a swamp became a national park\u2014[[the Everglades]]. In the mid-20th century national parks started to protect [[biodiversity]], not simply attractive scenery.\n\nCronon also believes the passion to save wilderness \"poses a serious threat to responsible [[environmentalism]]\" and writes that it allows people to \"give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead....to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness\".<ref name = \"Cronon\" />\n\n[[Michael Pollan]] has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book ''Second Nature'', Pollan writes that \"once a landscape is no longer 'virgin' it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable.\"<ref>Pollan, Michael (2003). ''Second Nature: A Gardener's Education,'' p. 188. Grove Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-4011-1}}.</ref> Another challenge to the conventional notion of wilderness comes from Robert Winkler in his book, ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness''. \"On walks in the unpeopled parts of the suburbs,\" Winkler writes, \"I\u2019ve witnessed the same wild creatures, struggles for survival, and natural beauty that we associate with true wilderness.\"<ref>Winkler, Robert. (2003). ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness.'' National Geographic {{ISBN|978-0-7922-6168-1}}.</ref> Attempts have been made, as in the [[Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers]] Act, to distinguish \"wild\" from various levels of human influence: in the Act, \"wild rivers\" are \"not impounded\", \"usually not accessible except by trail\", and their watersheds and shorelines are \"essentially primitive\".<ref>Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 1277, Act No. 283 as amended by Act 110, May 7, 1982)</ref>\n \nAnother source of criticism is that the criteria for wilderness designation is vague and open to interpretation. For example, the Wilderness Act states that wilderness must be roadless. The definition given for roadless is \"the absences of roads which have been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Durrant |first=Jeffrey O. |title=Struggle over Utah's San Rafael Swell: Wilderness, National Conservation Areas, and National Monuments |date=2007 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=978-0-8165-2669-7 |pages=43}}</ref> However, there have been added sub-definitions that have, in essence, made this standard unclear and open to interpretation.\n\nComing from a different direction, some criticism from the [[Deep Ecology]] movement argues against conflating \"wilderness\" with \"wilderness reservations\", viewing the latter term as an oxymoron that, by allowing the law as a human construct to define nature, unavoidably voids the very freedom and independence of human control that defines wilderness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Ecology for the 21st Century |date=1995 |publisher=Shambhala |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-57062-049-2 |pages=345, 339\u2013355 |author=Thomas Birch |authorlink=The Incarceration of Wildness: Wilderness Areas as Prisons|editor=George Sessions}}</ref> True wilderness requires the ability of life to undergo [[speciation]] with as little interference from humanity as possible.<ref>{{cite book |title=Deep Ecology for the 21st Century |date=1995 |publisher=Shambhala |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-57062-049-2 |pages=323, 323\u2013330 |author=George Sessions |authorlink=Introduction: Wilderness, the Wild, and Conservation Biology}}</ref> [[Anthropologist]] and scholar on wilderness [[Layla Abdel-Rahim]] argues that it is necessary to understand the principles that govern the economies of mutual aid and diversification in wilderness from a non-anthropocentric perspective.<ref>{{cite book |title=Children's Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness |date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-66110-2 |author=Layla AbdelRahim|author-link=Layla AbdelRahim}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Environment|Ecology|Earth sciences|Biology}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Aldo Leopold]]\n* [[Adventure travel]]\n* [[Biomass]]\n* [[Biomass (ecology)]]\n* [[Bioproduct]]\n* [[Camping]]\n* [[Conservation movement]]\n* [[Deforestation]]\n* [[Ecological footprint]]\n* [[Environmental education]]\n* [[Forest]]\n* [[Geology]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Hiking]]\n* [[Intact forest landscape]]\n* [[John Muir Lifetime Achievement Award]]\n* [[Land use]]\n* [[Last of the Wild]]\n* [[Leave no trace]]\n* [[List of U.S. Wilderness Areas]]\n* [[List of conservationists]]\n* [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]]\n* [[National Outdoor Leadership School]]\n* [[National Wilderness Preservation System]]\n* ''[[National Wildlife Magazine]]''\n* [[Native American use of fire]]\n* [[Natural landscape]]\n* [[Old-growth forest]]\n* [[Outdoor education]]\n* [[Permaforestry]]\n* [[Planetary habitability]]\n* [[Protected area]]\n* [[Wild fisheries]]\n* [[Wildcrafting]]\n* [[Wilderness Act]] (1964)\n* [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories#Categories|Wilderness Area (Protected Area Management Category)]]\n* [[World Wilderness Congress]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n[[File:Spiny Forest Ifaty Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|This [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny forest]] at [[Ifaty]], [[Madagascar]] features various [[Adansonia]] (baobab) species, [[Alluaudia procera]] (Madagascar ocotillo) and other vegetation.]]\n* [[Bill Bryson|Bryson, B]].
