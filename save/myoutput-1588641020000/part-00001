The film co stars [[Karyn Parsons]], [[Steven Martini]] and [[Michael Ironside]]. The film is a loose remake of the 1955 film ''[[The Private War of Major Benson]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]]. The film was released in the United States on March 24, 1995.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] Major Benson Winifred Payne, a hardened Marine, returns from a violent but successful drug raid in South America, only to find out that he was once again not promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. Payne receives an [[honorable discharge]] on the grounds that \"the wars of the world are no longer fought on the battlefield\", and that his military skills are no longer needed.\n\nPayne tries to adjust to civilian life by making application to the police academy. He hits a man repeatedly during a training scenario, causing him to be arrested for assault after the man was rendered unconscious. His former general visits him and informs Payne that he has secured a job for him that will get him back in the military.\n\nPayne arrives at Madison Preparatory School in [[Virginia]], and is informed by the principal that his job is to train the [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] \"green boys\", a disorderly group of delinquents and outcasts who have placed last in the Virginia Military Games eight years running. \n\nWhen Payne sees his company, he immediately tells them that, under his direction, they will win the games at all costs, regardless of their various shortcomings: being overweight, sickly, deaf, cross-eyed, orphaned, or from a [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional home]]. Afterward, he shaves all their heads bald. Payne also meets and clashes with Emily Walburn, the Academy counsellor who tries to soften Payne's discipline with understanding and feelings, especially towards six year old orphan Tiger (Orlando Brown).\n\nPayne's training and punishments are harsh, which force the cadets to execute a series of failed schemes to get rid of Payne. Things come to a head when Payne offers them the chance to get rid of him, he will quit if they bring the Military Games trophy to Madison soil. The boys set out one night to Wellington Academy, the current trophy holder, to steal it. However, the Wellington cadets ambush them, and the boys return to school badly beaten (Payne having alerted Wellington via an \"anonymous call\").\n\nOutside of the academy, Payne bonds with Emily and Tiger. Returning to the Academy, Payne is confronted by lead misfit Alex Stone ([[Steven Martini]]) about his deception, but Payne claims it was to show them what the real prize was. With their desire to honestly earn the trophy added to their desire to be rid of Payne, the boys begin to train hard to win. \n\nWhen Stone's alcoholic, obnoxious stepfather appears unannounced and harasses Alex, Major Payne orders him away, granting Payne a lot of respect with the cadets. Stone and his friends want to win the Military games trophy, if just to have Payne gone. The cadets band together under Payne's regimen. Weeks later, Major Payne says they have graduated the program and are fit to compete in the games.\n\nPayne is asked to return to the Marines to fight in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], but his deployment means he will miss the Military Games and disappoint the boys and Emily. As he waits for his train, he sees a family together, realizing that Tiger saw him as a father figure and that Payne is falling in love with Emily. \n\nAt the games, the boys are holding their own until Dotson, now a Wellington cadet trips Alex during the race spraining his ankle. Madison comes in second, but Alex's injury renders him unfit for the final event, a drill competition. In anger, the Madison cadets fight with the Wellington cadets. The fight is broken up, with the judges deliberating to have Madison disqualified for conduct unbecoming.\n\nHowever, Payne gives up his commission and shows up at the last minute, smooths things over with the referees and tells Tiger to lead Madison in drill. The group executes an unorthodox but entertaining routine which wins them the trophy.\n\nOn the first day of the new school year, Madison displays the Military Games trophy, along with another one for Alex Stone who won best individual participant. Payne resumes being an instructor, having married Emily and adopted Tiger. Stone resumes his role as a squad leader. Payne has softened quite a bit, telling the new recruits he's not only their commanding officer, but also their friend. When a new, disrespectful blind cadet shows up with his service dog, Payne shaves both him and his dog bald with his \"field knife,\" and laughs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Major]] Benson Winifred Payne\n* [[Karyn Parsons]] as Emily Walburn\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Dr. Phillips\n* [[Steven Martini]] as Cadet Alex J.
