In terms of design, Dorrie has a few elements in common with Yoshis, such as the white area of soft tissue spanning the whole lower part of the body and a similar round face that, since ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', even features a placement of the eyes and nostrils akin to that seen in Yoshis.\n\nDorrie returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and appears in two sizes.

While the original Pauline was portrayed as a [[blond]]e in a pink gown, this new version of the character was a [[Brown hair|brunette]] who wears a red dress.<ref name=\"ignpauline\" /> Because of her different design, the Pauline in the Game Boy version of ''Donkey Kong'' was initially considered in certain Mario media a separate character from the original incarnation of the character (who was still known as Lady) featured in the arcade and Famicom versions, with the two versions of the character being given separate profiles in Shogakukan's 1994 ''Mario Character Encyclopedia'' book.<ref name=lady_and_pauline>{{cite book|title=\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7248 \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u5927\u4e8b\u5178|trans-title=Mario Character Encyclopedia: Perfect Edition|publisher=Shogakukan|date=November 20, 1994|page=24|isbn=4092590679|url=http://i.imgur.com/3OabVR8.jpg}}</ref> However, later games and sources (most notably the Japanese version of ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS]]'') acknowledge that Pauline and Lady are meant to be the same character.<ref name=pauline_trophy_jp>{{cite video game|title=\u5927\u4e71\u95d8\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|trans-title=Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|language=Japanese|quote=\u540d\u524d\u304c\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3? \u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304f\u3066? \u306f\u3044\u3001\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u540d\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u7248\u304b\u3089|trans-quote=Is her name Lady? or is it, Pauline?

She is a guest VIP at the grand opening of the \"Super Mini Mario World\", a theme park based on Mini-Mario toys, where she is kidnapped by Donkey Kong. She also appears in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]'' for the DSiWare, and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem]]'' for the DS, where she is once again kidnapped by Donkey Kong.\n\nPauline returns in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' on the [[Nintendo Switch]] voiced by [[Kate Higgins]].

In the game, it allows the playable characters to ride him through certain levels. Plessie's name is a portmanteau of \"[[Plesiosaurus]]\" and \"Nessie.\" The former is an extinct group of large marine reptiles that are often confused as dinosaurs, whereas the latter is the nickname given to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Its design share some features with the design of Yoshis, such as the bipedal posture with short legs, the white soft tissue that spans the lower part of the body, big oval eyes pointing forward which feature a white sclera, the nostrils being hosted near the top of a round protruding end of the upper part of the muzzle, and a crest on the back of the head, although the shape of the latter is different.\n\nPlessie appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a support spirit.\n\n===Poochy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Poochy'''|\u30dd\u30c1|Pochi|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is [[Yoshi]]'s pet [[dog]]. Poochy doesn't have any ears or a nose, and he has big lips. Poochy is a good swimmer and can sniff out hidden items for Yoshi. Poochy can also do things that Yoshi can't, such as crossing over dangerous terrain, and jumping over walls to give Yoshi a boost out of his wall jumps. Poochy's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.\n\n===Professor E. Gadd===\n'''Professor Elvin Gadd''' ({{nihongo foot|'''Professor Oya M\u0101'''|\u30aa\u30e4\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u535a\u58eb|Oya M\u0101 Hakase|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan), more commonly known as '''E. Gadd''', is a [[scientist]] who, with his various inventions, helps Luigi save his brother Mario and  the mansion. His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the four secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. She is the sister of Cappy, who is kidnapped by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] as a gift to [[Princess Peach]] to wear on their wedding day.\n\n===Toad Brigade===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Toad Brigade'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa\u63a2\u691c\u968a|Kinopio Tankentai|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a group of five Toads that aid Mario through some games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. They are led by Captain Toad. Later the group would expand to include Toadette, bringing the membership up to six. The members consist of Captain Toad, Toadette, Hint Toad (blue), Yellow Toad, Banktoad (green), and Mailtoad (magenta).\n\n===Toadsworth===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Toadsworth'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u3058\u3044|Kinojii|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime [[Steward (office)|steward]], first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game.\n\nPaper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'' where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake where he was inhaled by Bowser. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.\n\nToadsworth makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' when the player wins a cup. He acts as an umpire in ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the [[GameCube]] as well as in the [[remake]] for the [[Wii]], in which Toadsworth reprimands the player when a foul shot is made. In ''[[Mario Party 7]]'', he is a host of the boards. He finally becomes playable in both ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]''.\n\nToadsworth is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Wario]] and [[Waluigi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fenech |first=Stephen |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/meet-the-voice-of-super-mario-charles-martinet/story-e6frewyr-1225772856617 |title=Meet the voice of Super Mario Charles Martinet |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> N-Philes criticized Toadsworth's voice in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', calling it \"laughable\", \"comical\", and \"utterly pessimistic\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Gareth Trinkwon |url=http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903145402/http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=News :: Super Mario Sunshine |publisher=N-Philes |accessdate=2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporting antagonists==\n===Boom Boom===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Boom Boom'''|\u30d6\u30f3\u30d6\u30f3|Bunbun|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the henchman and faithful servant of Bowser. He first appeared in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as one of the main antagonists of the game, where he often fights with Mario or Luigi by chasing him flailing his arms, jumping high and flying at them. Boom Boom returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' 23 years after their last appearance. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', he reprises his old role from ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', guarding the fortresses and towers.\n\nIn four episodes of ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Boom Boom appears as a silent powerhouse who often cause troubles to Mario and Luigi.\n\n===Broodals===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Broodals'''|\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30eb\u30ba|Bur\u016bdaruzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are a group of villainous anthropomorphic [[rabbit]]s who double as wedding planners in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Their boss is Madame Broode. They were hired by Bowser in order to stop Mario from reaching him. The members consist of Topper, Hariet, Rango and Spewart.\n\n===Draggadon===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Draggadons'''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30c9\u30f3|Doragodon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[dragon]]s first appearing in the game ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''. Although in said game only Draggadon, the king of an isolated volcano called Pyropuff Peak, and Gold Draggadon, the king of the Golden Realm.\n\nThe first, named Draggadon, is fought in Episode 1-10: The King of Pyropuff Peak, Episode 2-9: Draggadon's Revenge, and Bonus Episode-11: Mummy-Me at Pyropuff Peak. When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing. Once again, Toadette befriends him, and they conquer even more enemies.\n\nUnlike Wingo, Draggadon is not battled directly. Captain Toad and Toadette must avoid his attacks to the end of the level by hiding behind walls, and at the end, knock a pillar on his head. He is then knocked unconscious, and the Toads collect the Power Star. Another Draggadon, named Gold Draggadon, also appears in a later episode, as the king of the Golden Realm. Like Draggadon, Captain Toad must also fight Gold Draggadon as boss, although fireballs will move faster and the lava will rise quicker, and after defeating him, he lets Captain Toad and Toadette ride him.\n\n===Dry Bowser===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Dry Bowser'''|\u307b\u306d\u30af\u30c3\u30d1|Hone Kuppa|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a recurring antagonist in the ''Mario'' series. Debuting as a form of Bowser after losing his flesh in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', the character has appeared as his own being starting with ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', often serving as the final antagonist in the main games. In ''[[Mario Party: Island Tour]]'', Bowser refers to Dry Bowser as a \"close family friend\".{{cn|date=April 2020}} Dry Bowser is a playable character in several of the ''Mario'' spin-off games.\n\n===Fawful===\n{{Main|Fawful}}\n\n'''{{nihongo foot|Fawful|\u30b2\u30e9\u30b3\u30d3\u30c3\u30c4|Gerakobittsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', is a recurring antagonist in the ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series. The character is considered to be \"insane,\" often serving as or the sidekick to the main antagonist in the games.\n\n===Foreman Spike===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Foreman Spike'''|\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc|Burakk\u012b|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the angry [[Construction foreman|foreman]] of the construction site where Mario and Luigi worked in ''[[Wrecking Crew (video game)|Wrecking Crew]]''. Rather than help them, Spike continuously tried to hinder the brothers from doing their job.

She possesses the usual Magikoopa powers, and is primarily distinguished by her ability to summon yellow blocks, which she has used to both impede and combat Mario. She first appeared in ''[[Paper Mario]]'' for the Nintendo 64, helping Bowser by leaving enemies in Mario's way, transporting Bowser into the Star Spirit Sanctuary, and augmenting his size and power in the final battle. After being defeated by the Star Kid, Twink, she continued to work for him. In ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', she acted as Bowser's second-in-command. Generally, her position is very similar with Kamek who appeared earlier than her, which possibly means why she is replaced by him in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star]]''. [[IGN]] rated her as one of the weirdest ''Mario'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/119/1199242p3.html|title=Weirdest Mario Characters|first=Audrey|last=Drake|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n===King Bob-omb===\n{{nihongo foot|'''King Bob-omb'''|\u30dc\u30e0\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Bomu Kingu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the king of the Bob-ombs. He is mostly recognized for being the first boss fought in the game ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and its remake. Guarding the Power Star, which Bowser entrusted him with, he does not give it up without fighting the player.

He can perform various feats of magic, such as self-duplication, [[teleportation]], shooting magical blasts, and changing the size of other creatures. In Japan, the character shares his name with his species, '''Kamek''' (which are known outside Japan as Magikoopas), which can lead to confusion surrounding his appearances. This will sometimes lead to a literal translation, as in ''Super Princess Peach'' where a boss is described as \"A Kamek made huge by magic.\" Some Japanese sources such as the guide for ''Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island'' call him \"Fang\" to distinguish him from regular Magikoopas.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Baby Luma/Lumas===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Baby Luma'''|\u30d9\u30d3\u30a3\u30c1\u30b3|Bebi Chiko|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is Mario's main companion in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.

In the ending of the game, Baby Luma sacrifices his life along his brethren to save the universe from a [[black hole]].\n\nIn ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', Baby Luma is found by Mario while he was on his way to Princess Peach's Castle and they join forces to rescue the town from a new attack by Bowser, only to be sent out in a new adventure. In this game Baby Luma often receives messages from Rosalina, who remains anonymous for most of the game.

He helps Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi ride across water or reach higher areas. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' explicitly refers to Dorries as a species and it features two additional Dorries, one violet, and one yellow. In terms of design, Dorrie has a few elements in common with Yoshis, such as the white area of soft tissue spanning the whole lower part of the body and a similar round face that, since ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', even features a placement of the eyes and nostrils akin to that seen in Yoshis.\n\nDorrie returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and appears in two sizes. Mario can ride on his back to cross large bodies of poison in World 4-1 and World 4-6.

He returned to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe]]'' as a fifth playable character along with Toadette, Luigi, Toad and Mario.\n\nHe is a purple rabbit with round eyes, long ears, and black limbs. He also wears a white handkerchief with a drawing of a large mouth with sharpened teeth, similar to Bowser Jr.'s mask (though despite this he does not work for Bowser), as well as orange shoes and white gloves.\n\nNabbit also appeared as a stage hazard in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros.

In the game, it allows the playable characters to ride him through certain levels. Plessie's name is a portmanteau of \"[[Plesiosaurus]]\" and \"Nessie.\" The former is an extinct group of large marine reptiles that are often confused as dinosaurs, whereas the latter is the nickname given to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Its design share some features with the design of Yoshis, such as the bipedal posture with short legs, the white soft tissue that spans the lower part of the body, big oval eyes pointing forward which feature a white sclera, the nostrils being hosted near the top of a round protruding end of the upper part of the muzzle, and a crest on the back of the head, although the shape of the latter is different.\n\nPlessie appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Gadd''', is a [[scientist]] who, with his various inventions, helps Luigi save his brother Mario and  the mansion. His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the four secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.

When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing. Once again, Toadette befriends him, and they conquer even more enemies.\n\nUnlike Wingo, Draggadon is not battled directly. Captain Toad and Toadette must avoid his attacks to the end of the level by hiding behind walls, and at the end, knock a pillar on his head. He is then knocked unconscious, and the Toads collect the Power Star. Another Draggadon, named Gold Draggadon, also appears in a later episode, as the king of the Golden Realm.
