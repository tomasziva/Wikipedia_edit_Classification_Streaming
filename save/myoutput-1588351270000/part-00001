The majority of the churches remain [[consecration|consecrated]], and many are occasionally still used for worship.  Local communities are encouraged to use them for appropriate activities and events, and the buildings provide an educational resource, allowing children and young people to study history and architecture. Nearly 2&nbsp;million people visit the Trust's churches each year.<ref name=trust/>  As most of the churches remain consecrated, they are used for occasional services where this is practical, and some are venues for concerts and other purposes.\n\nThis list contains the 62&nbsp;churches cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England, covering the counties of [[Bristol]], Wiltshire, [[Somerset]], Dorset, [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/findachurch/?region=South_West_England | title = Find a CCT church&nbsp;\u2013 South West England | accessdate = 20 October 2010 | publisher = [[Churches Conservation Trust]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219124035/http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/findachurch/?region=South_West_England | archivedate = 19 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The majority are village churches, and in the case of [[St Giles' Church, Imber|St Giles']] church in [[Imber]], Wiltshire, in a village from which the entire civilian population was evicted in 1943 to provide an exercise area for American troops preparing for the [[invasion of Europe]] during the Second World War.

Many of the churches are built on the sites of earlier places of worship, but the oldest building in the list is the [[Old Church of St Nicholas, Uphill|Old Church of St Nicholas]] at [[Uphill]], Somerset, which is largely roofless but is still occasionally used for services. The most recent is [[St Mary's Church, South Tidworth|St Mary's Church]] in South [[Tidworth]], Wiltshire, which was built in 1878. Some of the buildings, such as [[St Mary's Church, Wilton|St Mary's Church]] in [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]], Wiltshire, are partially ruined, but many have impressive interiors, often dating back several hundred years. [[St John the Baptist Church, Inglesham|St John the Baptist Church]] in [[Inglesham]], Wiltshire, has [[mural|wall paintings]] and other churches have highly decorated [[pulpit]]s or [[reredos]]. Many still host [[Anglican]] services, but others are used by different denominations or have been converted for secular use. [[St Thomas \u00e0 Becket Church, Pensford|St Thomas \u00e0 Becket Church]] in [[Pensford]], Somerset, has been converted into a private house, however the tower remains in the care of the trust.

The majority of the churches remain [[consecration|consecrated]], and many are occasionally still used for worship.  Local communities are encouraged to use them for appropriate activities and events, and the buildings provide an educational resource, allowing children and young people to study history and architecture. Nearly 2&nbsp;million people visit the Trust's churches each year.<ref name=trust/>  As most of the churches remain consecrated, they are used for occasional services where this is practical, and some are venues for concerts and other purposes.\n\nThis list contains the 62&nbsp;churches cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England, covering the counties of [[Bristol]], Wiltshire, [[Somerset]], Dorset, [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/findachurch/?region=South_West_England | title = Find a CCT church&nbsp;\u2013 South West England | accessdate = 20 October 2010 | publisher = [[Churches Conservation Trust]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219124035/http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/findachurch/?region=South_West_England | archivedate = 19 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The majority are village churches, and in the case of [[St Giles' Church, Imber|St Giles']] church in [[Imber]], Wiltshire, in a village from which the entire civilian population was evicted in 1943 to provide an exercise area for American troops preparing for the [[invasion of Europe]] during the Second World War.

Many of the churches are built on the sites of earlier places of worship, but the oldest building in the list is the [[Old Church of St Nicholas, Uphill|Old Church of St Nicholas]] at [[Uphill]], Somerset, which is largely roofless but is still occasionally used for services. The most recent is [[St Mary's Church, South Tidworth|St Mary's Church]] in South [[Tidworth]], Wiltshire, which was built in 1878. Some of the buildings, such as [[St Mary's Church, Wilton|St Mary's Church]] in [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]], Wiltshire, are partially ruined, but many have impressive interiors, often dating back several hundred years. [[St John the Baptist Church, Inglesham|St John the Baptist Church]] in [[Inglesham]], Wiltshire, has [[mural|wall paintings]] and other churches have highly decorated [[pulpit]]s or [[reredos]].
