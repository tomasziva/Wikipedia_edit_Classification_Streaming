In August 2008, Biden criticized Russia's [[Russo-Georgian War|military action in Georgia]] in support of [[South Ossetia]]n separatists. \"By acting disproportionately with a full-scale attack on [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and seeking the ouster of Georgia's democratically elected President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], Moscow is jeopardizing its standing in Europe and the broader international community\u2014and risking very real practical and political consequences\", Biden wrote in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' op-ed. Biden urged Russia to abide by the negotiated cease-fire.<ref name=CFR/>\n\nIn a 2018 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' op-ed co-written with Michael Carpenter, Biden described Russia as a [[Kleptocracy|kleptocratic]], [[Right-wing populism|nationalist-populist]] state that considers [[Western democracy]] its existential threat. He acknowledged that the [[Kremlin]] launched coordinated attacks across many domains\u2014military, political, economic, informational\u2014against various Western democratic countries, including [[cyberattack]]s on the [[2016 United States presidential election]] and [[2017 French presidential election]]. As a result of Russia's threat, Biden supports a \"strong response\" with cooperation from America's allies and campaign finance reform that will prohibit foreign donations from flowing into domestic elections.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-12-05/how-stand-kremlin|title=How to Stand Up to the Kremlin|last=Biden|first=Joseph R.|date=2019-04-25|access-date=2019-06-12|last2=Jr|issue=January/February 2018|language=en-US|issn=0015-7120|last3=Carpenter|first3=Michael}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Western democracies must also address glaring vulnerabilities in their electoral systems, financial sectors, cyber-infrastructure, and media ecosystems. The U.S. campaign finance system, for example, needs to be reformed to deny foreign actors\u2014from Russia and elsewhere\u2014the ability to interfere in American elections. Authorities can no longer turn a blind eye to the secretive bundling of donations that allows foreign money to flow to U.S. organizations (such as \u201cghost corporations\u201d) that in turn contribute to super PACs and other putatively independent political organizations, such as trade associations and so-called 501(c)(4) groups.
