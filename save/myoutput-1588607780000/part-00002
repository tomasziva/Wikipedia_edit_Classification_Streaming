Dong-A Institute started with 630 students and a faculty of 13 professors and 22 instructors in Jongno-gu, [[Seoul]]. After producing its first graduates in 1941, Dong-A tried to elevate itself to college status, to no avail. In May 1941, the Institute relocated and offered education specializing in engineering and technology to 100 students who had finished secondary school. In 1943, with Korea still under Japanese occupation, the Institute was suspended from recruiting new students, which resulted in a temporary shut-down of the school on March 15, 1944, when the last 78 students graduated.\n\nUpon the restoration of the nation's independence in August 1945, Dong-A Institute renamed itself the Engineering Institute for National Foundation and settled at 251 Shindang-dong, Seoul. Institute founder Dr. Kim Lyun-joon foresaw the importance of industrial advancement in the reconstruction of Korea, and established Hanyang as a judicial and academic body. The board of trustees at that time included Myowook Lee, Byeongok Cho, Kwansoo Baik, Wonchul Lee, Waljoon Kim, Taeyong Choi, and Lyunjoon Kim, who had led the nation's independence movement. In July 1948, the school was accredited as the first four-year engineering college in Korea with Kim Lyun-joon as the first dean. Six departments were set up, including Electrical, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering, Architecture, Chemical, and Mining as well as an Engineering High School and a middle school.\n\nAlthough during the [[Korean War]], many of the school's facilities were destroyed and the professors and students were scattered, classes were continued in Busan with temporary teachers. However, even during their refuge, the College fostered numerous competent science teachers by building a training center for secondary school teachers in the technical fields. In 1953, it was authorized as a graduate school by the Ministry of Education. The building was restored in Haengdang-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul and it is still the current address of Hanyang University.\n\nIn February 1959, its status was raised to that of a four-year university. The following month Hanyang University formed the university foundation and Kim Lyun-joon was inaugurated as the first President. The University started with 19 departments in 3 colleges (the College of Engineering, the College of Liberal Arts and Science and the College of Politics and Economy) and 6 departments offering evening courses. As the University has expanded its size, the Colleges of Music, Physical Education and Education were newly established. By adding the College of Medicine, 46 departments of 7 colleges and 9 departments offering night courses were established.\n\nHanyang University Medical Center was established in 1972, and in 1979, a second campus was established at the newly built industrial city of [[Ansan]]. The newly established campus was named the \u201cHanyang Banwol Campus\u201d at that time and was renamed as the \u201cAnsan Campus\u201d in 1987 which was used until the campus was renamed as the Education Research Industry Cluster at Ansan (ERICA), in September, 2009.\n\n==Organizations==\n===Seoul Campus===\n[[File:Hanyang University 008.JPG|thumb|Hanyang University Seoul, 2013]]\nThe Seoul Campus is home to 15 colleges and 60 departments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/seoul-campus2|title=Hanyang University Seoul Campus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hanyang University|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2018-03-15}}</ref> Seoul Campus, in particular, is made up of a variety of research centers according to field of academics that promote study and cooperation.

Resident government research institutes in this designated \u201cCluster Zone\u201d include KITECH, KTL, and KERI. Research centers for such private companies as LG Innotek and LG Micron also have a presence there.\n* In 2006, Twenty-eight project teams from Hanyang were selected for Brain Korea (BK21) Phase II project, which is the second stage of the Korean government sponsored program that seeks to develop and promote world-class research universities. HYU enjoyed particular success in the field of science and technology, with all project teams that applied being selected for the program. Over the next seven years, HYU will receive 15.4 billion won a year in government funding for BK21 research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20060427/8300666/1|title=BK 21 University 2006|publisher=Donga News|accessdate=2006-04-27|date=2006-04-27}}</ref>\n* Hanyang currently ranks number one among Korean universities in technology transfer revenues, earning more than 10 billion won between 2006 and 2009. Moreover, the HYU Center for Business Incubation is consistently recognized for its standard of excellence each year by the Ministry of Information and Communication. In addition to the domestic market, the Center has also making inroads into China by establishing a local presence in Shanghai. Furthermore, HYU is the only Korean university to earn the highest rating for five consecutive years in the University led TLO (Technology Licensing Office) program supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology. Most recently, the Center transferred the pico porous polymer membrane technology to a global enterprise.\n* Hanyang is operating the Cell Therapy Center for Intractable Neurological Disorders. At the center, they are providing therapy for the patients and conducting research to find cures for Lou Gehrig's disease, which is said to be the first in the world that is closest to being approved by the Korean FDA.\n* As the hub of engineering and research, Hanyang has research centers around the campus. At the Innovation Center for Engineering Education in Hanyang University Seoul campus, researchers are conducting research on bipedal robots to improve its efficiency. They are making robots, which resemble humans. Through precise programming and control, they are simulating every movement of humans and succeeded in letting the robots change directions efficiently while walking, mimicking how humans change directions in real life. The main focus of their research is using a process called slip foot, which means that when changing directions, one of the robot's feet \u2018slips\u2019 on the ground when its body rotates to the desired direction. Once it gets fully developed, the researchers predict that the human-like robots could also be used in households, as seen in many sci-fi movies.\n* Research teams at Hanyang are also making progress in their research on silicon and germanium. The team previously discovered that the proper alternative for this may be a Si-GE (germanium) composite. It benefits both the mechanics and kinetics associated with lithium while maintaining its high specific capacity, especially volumetric capacity. It has recently been explored as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its stable cycle performance and excellent rate capability. The team studied both the Si-Ge and Ge-Si core-shell nanowires and figured out the nanowires that have a Si core and a Ge shell demonstrates a much improved electrochemical performance, especially cycle performance and rate capability.\n* In the biomedical field, researchers are making strides in the methods to cure malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. They are annotating the Pf3D7 strain, which is a specific strain of the Pf species. The recent completion of the genome sequence of Pf offers new opportunities to identify more effective targets for drug development and to gain insight into the biological pathways involved in malaria pathogenesis.\n* Researchers in the field of Chemistry are also developing photo-responsive polymers, transparency and high heat resistant polymers for flexible displays, biodegradable polymers, and new functional polymers. Researchers report on a new acrylamide-based hard-soft hybrid BCP that can generate high quality lithographic patterns satisfying all six criteria mentioned above. It has additional potential as a scaffold for metallic nanostructures. PDOPAM-PMMA BCPs were synthesized from newly designed crystalline p-dodecylphenylacrylamide (DOPAM) and methyl methacrylate monomers via RAFT polymerization. The findings of his study suggest that the newly developed BCPs can be a universal and practical candidate for the implementation of sub-20&nbsp;nm directed self-assembly processes. With the fruits of their research, the team's research was selected as one of the top 5 percent of papers of Advanced Material.\n\n== Recent Highlights <ref>{{cite web|url=http://book.hanyang.ac.kr/Viewer/pride2016|title=2016 Hanyang Pride 30|publisher=Hanyang University|accessdate=2017-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://book.hanyang.ac.kr/Viewer/TD5QSMZ40LON|title=2017 Hanyang Pridebook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ==\n'''The First University to Install the Cloud System'''\n \nHanyang university Cloud Center opens in September 2017.

Dong-A Institute started with 630 students and a faculty of 13 professors and 22 instructors in Jongno-gu, [[Seoul]]. After producing its first graduates in 1941, Dong-A tried to elevate itself to college status, to no avail. In May 1941, the Institute relocated and offered education specializing in engineering and technology to 100 students who had finished secondary school. In 1943, with Korea still under Japanese occupation, the Institute was suspended from recruiting new students, which resulted in a temporary shut-down of the school on March 15, 1944, when the last 78 students graduated.\n\nUpon the restoration of the nation's independence in August 1945, Dong-A Institute renamed itself the Engineering Institute for National Foundation and settled at 251 Shindang-dong, Seoul. Institute founder Dr. Kim Lyun-joon foresaw the importance of industrial advancement in the reconstruction of Korea, and established Hanyang as a judicial and academic body. The board of trustees at that time included Myowook Lee, Byeongok Cho, Kwansoo Baik, Wonchul Lee, Waljoon Kim, Taeyong Choi, and Lyunjoon Kim, who had led the nation's independence movement. In July 1948, the school was accredited as the first four-year engineering college in Korea with Kim Lyun-joon as the first dean. Six departments were set up, including Electrical, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering, Architecture, Chemical, and Mining as well as an Engineering High School and a middle school.\n\nAlthough during the [[Korean War]], many of the school's facilities were destroyed and the professors and students were scattered, classes were continued in Busan with temporary teachers. However, even during their refuge, the College fostered numerous competent science teachers by building a training center for secondary school teachers in the technical fields. In 1953, it was authorized as a graduate school by the Ministry of Education. The building was restored in Haengdang-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul and it is still the current address of Hanyang University.\n\nIn February 1959, its status was raised to that of a four-year university. The following month Hanyang University formed the university foundation and Kim Lyun-joon was inaugurated as the first President. The University started with 19 departments in 3 colleges (the College of Engineering, the College of Liberal Arts and Science and the College of Politics and Economy) and 6 departments offering evening courses. As the University has expanded its size, the Colleges of Music, Physical Education and Education were newly established. By adding the College of Medicine, 46 departments of 7 colleges and 9 departments offering night courses were established.\n\nHanyang University Medical Center was established in 1972, and in 1979, a second campus was established at the newly built industrial city of [[Ansan]]. The newly established campus was named the \u201cHanyang Banwol Campus\u201d at that time and was renamed as the \u201cAnsan Campus\u201d in 1987 which was used until the campus was renamed as the Education Research Industry Cluster at Ansan (ERICA), in September, 2009.\n\n==Organizations==\n===Seoul Campus===\n[[File:Hanyang University 008.JPG|thumb|Hanyang University Seoul, 2013]]\nThe Seoul Campus is home to 15 colleges and 60 departments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/seoul-campus2|title=Hanyang University Seoul Campus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hanyang University|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2018-03-15}}</ref> Seoul Campus, in particular, is made up of a variety of research centers according to field of academics that promote study and cooperation.

Research centers for such private companies as LG Innotek and LG Micron also have a presence there.\n* In 2006, Twenty-eight project teams from Hanyang were selected for Brain Korea (BK21) Phase II project, which is the second stage of the Korean government sponsored program that seeks to develop and promote world-class research universities. HYU enjoyed particular success in the field of science and technology, with all project teams that applied being selected for the program. Over the next seven years, HYU will receive 15.4 billion won a year in government funding for BK21 research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20060427/8300666/1|title=BK 21 University 2006|publisher=Donga News|accessdate=2006-04-27|date=2006-04-27}}</ref>\n* Hanyang currently ranks number one among Korean universities in technology transfer revenues, earning more than 10 billion won between 2006 and 2009. Moreover, the HYU Center for Business Incubation is consistently recognized for its standard of excellence each year by the Ministry of Information and Communication. In addition to the domestic market, the Center has also making inroads into China by establishing a local presence in Shanghai. Furthermore, HYU is the only Korean university to earn the highest rating for five consecutive years in the University led TLO (Technology Licensing Office) program supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology. Most recently, the Center transferred the pico porous polymer membrane technology to a global enterprise.\n* Hanyang is operating the Cell Therapy Center for Intractable Neurological Disorders. At the center, they are providing therapy for the patients and conducting research to find cures for Lou Gehrig's disease, which is said to be the first in the world that is closest to being approved by the Korean FDA.\n* As the hub of engineering and research, Hanyang has research centers around the campus. At the Innovation Center for Engineering Education in Hanyang University Seoul campus, researchers are conducting research on bipedal robots to improve its efficiency. They are making robots, which resemble humans. Through precise programming and control, they are simulating every movement of humans and succeeded in letting the robots change directions efficiently while walking, mimicking how humans change directions in real life. The main focus of their research is using a process called slip foot, which means that when changing directions, one of the robot's feet \u2018slips\u2019 on the ground when its body rotates to the desired direction. Once it gets fully developed, the researchers predict that the human-like robots could also be used in households, as seen in many sci-fi movies.\n* Research teams at Hanyang are also making progress in their research on silicon and germanium. The team previously discovered that the proper alternative for this may be a Si-GE (germanium) composite. It benefits both the mechanics and kinetics associated with lithium while maintaining its high specific capacity, especially volumetric capacity. It has recently been explored as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its stable cycle performance and excellent rate capability. The team studied both the Si-Ge and Ge-Si core-shell nanowires and figured out the nanowires that have a Si core and a Ge shell demonstrates a much improved electrochemical performance, especially cycle performance and rate capability.\n* In the biomedical field, researchers are making strides in the methods to cure malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. They are annotating the Pf3D7 strain, which is a specific strain of the Pf species. The recent completion of the genome sequence of Pf offers new opportunities to identify more effective targets for drug development and to gain insight into the biological pathways involved in malaria pathogenesis.\n* Researchers in the field of Chemistry are also developing photo-responsive polymers, transparency and high heat resistant polymers for flexible displays, biodegradable polymers, and new functional polymers. Researchers report on a new acrylamide-based hard-soft hybrid BCP that can generate high quality lithographic patterns satisfying all six criteria mentioned above. It has additional potential as a scaffold for metallic nanostructures. PDOPAM-PMMA BCPs were synthesized from newly designed crystalline p-dodecylphenylacrylamide (DOPAM) and methyl methacrylate monomers via RAFT polymerization. The findings of his study suggest that the newly developed BCPs can be a universal and practical candidate for the implementation of sub-20&nbsp;nm directed self-assembly processes. With the fruits of their research, the team's research was selected as one of the top 5 percent of papers of Advanced Material.\n\n== Recent Highlights <ref>{{cite web|url=http://book.hanyang.ac.kr/Viewer/pride2016|title=2016 Hanyang Pride 30|publisher=Hanyang University|accessdate=2017-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://book.hanyang.ac.kr/Viewer/TD5QSMZ40LON|title=2017 Hanyang Pridebook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ==\n'''The First University to Install the Cloud System'''\n \nHanyang university Cloud Center opens in September 2017.
