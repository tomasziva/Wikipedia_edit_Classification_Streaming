{"title_page": "Academic grading in Canada", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{confusing|date=August 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2012}}\n}}\n{{grading}}\n'''Academic grading in Canada''' varies by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]], level of education (e.g., [[elementary education|elementary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], and [[tertiary education|tertiary]]), by institution, and faculty. The following are commonly used conversions from percentage grades to letter grades, however, this is not necessarily meaningful, since there is not a uniform scheme for assigning percentage grades either.\n\n==Academic grading==\n\n===British Columbia===\nThis is the system of grading used by grade schools and high schools in BC.

In francophone schools, from kindergarten to grade 9 an alternative grading system is used instead of percentages and letter grades: numbers 1 through 4 are used (4 is excellent, 3 is good, 2 is acceptable, and 1 is poor).\n\nNote: not all schools utilize a +/- system when giving grades. Some just give the generic grade.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Letter\n! Percent\n\n|-\n! A+\n| 90%\u2013100%\n|-\n! A\n| 85%\u201389%\n|-\n! A-\n| 80%\u201384%\n|-\n! B+\n| 75%\u201379%\n|-\n!

No mark is given.\n\nP: Pass: indicates that the student has achieved the bare minimum grade to pass the class granted by a teacher due to reasons beyond the student's control. A grade of P translates into 50% when used to calculate averages for university or college admission.\n\nA mark of 0%\u201349%, or a D and under, is a failure for a class and is typically given for high school and post-secondary students only, but can be given to junior high students too, but isn't typically done. A failing grade will also result in not earning credits for an Alberta High School Diploma or any subject taken in post-secondary and typically means the student will more than likely repeat the course.\n\n===Ontario===\nThe grading standards for public elementary and secondary schools (including secular and [[separate school|separate]]; English and French [[first language]] schools) is set by the [[Ontario]] [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]] and includes letter grades and percentages. In addition to letter grades and percentages, the Ministry of Education also uses a level system to marks its students. The four levels correspond to how students are marked on the [[Ontario rubric]]. The following is the levels on the Ontario rubric, its meaning, and its corresponding letter/percentage grades:\n* Level 4, beyond government standards (A; 80 percent and above)\n* Level 3, at government standards (B; 70\u201379 percent)\n* Level 2, approaching government standards (C; 60\u201369 percent)\n* Level 1, well below government standards (D; 50\u201359 percent)\nThe grading standards for A-letter grades changed in September 2010 to coincide with a new academic year. The new changes require a higher percentage grade by two or five points to obtain an A or A+ respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! Letter !!
