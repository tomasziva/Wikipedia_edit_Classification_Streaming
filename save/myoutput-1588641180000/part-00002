Over 214 characters have appeared in the film franchise.\n\n===Autobots===\nIn the first five films, 40 '''Autobots''' have appeared in the series. By the end of ''Dark of the Moon'', ten Autobots remain on Earth. Five years later, half of the Autobots have been eliminated by Cemetery Wind, Lockdown and TRF. By the end of ''The Last Knight'', all surviving Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Hound, Drift, Crosshairs, Cogman, Daytrader, Hot Rod, Sqweeks, Wheelie, Brains, Topspin, Roadbuster, Mirage/Dino, Trench, Bulldog, Grimlock, Slug, Strafe, Scorn, the Mini Dinobots, HMS Alliance Autobot and the Knights of Iacon) finally leave Earth and return to Cybertron.\n\n* '''Primes''' \u2013 The title of Prime is bestowed upon the civilian and spiritual leader of Cybertron. Among the known Primes are:\n** '''[[Optimus Prime]]''' (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) is the leader of the Autobots, the last Prime of Dynasty of Primes, one of the Guardian Knights, keeper of the [[Matrix of Leadership]] and the narrator of the series. He transforms into a 1997 red and blue [[Peterbilt 379]] semi-trailer truck in the first three films, a rusty 1973 [[Marmon Motor Company|Marmon]] semi cab-over truck in the beginning of the fourth film, and later a blue and red [[Western Star Trucks|Western Star 5700XE Custom]] Phantom semi-truck. In the [[Transformers (film)|first film]], Optimus Prime arrives on Earth with Ratchet, Ironhide, and Jazz trying to find the AllSpark. At Mission City, he kills Bonecrusher and battles Megatron, but Sam pushes the AllSpark into Megatron's chest, killing him and destroying the cube. As a result, Bumblebee spoke for the first time and Cybertron can no longer be restored. Afterward, Optimus and the other Autobots form an alliance with the humans and work closely with NEST. In ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Revenge of the Fallen]]'', Optimus is killed (impaled from behind) by Megatron after a battle with him, Starscream and Grindor. Near the end of the film, he is later revived by Sam with the Matrix of Leadership and is fused with Jetfire, making him more powerful. Optimus Prime then faces The Fallen and Megatron. After a vicious fight, Optimus severely wounds Megatron and kills the Fallen. In ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'', Optimus revives Sentinel Prime using the Matrix of Leadership and revealed he was the leader of the Autobots before him. But, Sentinel later betrays the Autobots and joins the Decepticons to restore Cybertron with the Pillars. During the battle in Chicago, Optimus kills Sentinel Prime (avenging Ironhide's death) along with all Decepticons, including the Driller, Shockwave, and finally Megatron. Optimus finally has a  trailer similar to his Generation 1 counterpart,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdsociety.com/optimus-prime-trailer-transformers-3/|title=Optimus Prime Trailer in Transformers 3|accessdate=July 7, 2010|date=July 7, 2010|work=Nerdsociety}}</ref> and has been redesigned to look more heroic.<ref name=\"ILMMakeover\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=16918|title=Optimus Prime and Bumblebee Getting Makeovers in \"Transformers 3\"|publisher=WorstPreviews}}</ref> The trailer contains enhanced weapons, a shield and a flight gear. Optimus loses his right arm to Sentinel Prime at the film's climax. In ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'', he is being hunted by both the Transformer-hating Harold Attinger and a Cybertronian bounty hunter, Lockdown, who is working for the Creators to bring him to Cybertron. Soon after his capture and in the battle of Hong Kong, Optimus tames the four legendary warriors (the Dinobots) and rides Grimlock to fight Galvatron (Megatron reincarnated) and his new army of man-made Transformers. After defeating Galvatron's army, he successfully kills Lockdown and Harold Attinger (avenging the deaths of Ratchet, Leadfoot, and Lucas among others). He then sets the Dinobots free and asks his fellow Autobots to protect Cade and his family before taking the Seed into space and going after the Creators. In ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight|The Last Knight]]'', when frozen and floating past [[Jupiter]], he arrives at Cybertron, now a dead planet. There he finds Quintessa, the Prime of Life. She brainwashes Optimus to do her bidding and gives him a red marking to achieve her goal of destroying Earth, which she reveals is an ancient enemy planet called \"[[Unicron]]\". She tells Prime that he must retrieve her staff to rebuild Cybertron. Prime's eyes turn [[purple]], his paint scheme turns to black, and he becomes '''Nemesis Prime''' under Quintessa's control. Later, just as he is about to kill Bumblebee, Bee speaks for the first time in 10 years. The sound of his friend's long lost voice causes Prime to return to normal, shown by his eyes turning blue again and his red marking disappeared. He rides with Dragonstorm into battle. After brutally slaughtering Quintessa and saving both worlds, Optimus and all Autobots return to Cybertron but don't actually leave Earth as Earth and Cybertron are now joined as one planet. Optimus Prime reappears in ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'', in which he is designed more like his G1 self. In the film, he leads the Autobots against the Decepticons trying to take over Cybertron, but is forced to retreat when Decepticon reinforcements led by Soundwave and Shockwave attack them. Realizing that Cybertron has fallen, he orders all Autobots to get to their escape pods. However, he has given Bumblebee the task to protect Earth and set up a base for them before being attacked by Ravage and other Decepticons. In the end of the film, he praises Bumblebee for keeping Earth safe.\n** '''Sentinel Prime''' (voiced by [[Leonard Nimoy]]) is a member of the Dynasty of Primes, the first leader of the [[Autobot]]s and the captain of the Ark who transforms into a red and black [[Rosenbauer Panther]] [[airport crash tender]] [[Fire engine|fire truck]]. He is the leader of the Autobots before Optimus succeeds him, during the War for Cybertron. He makes a deal with Megatron to restore and rebuild Cybertron to bring the Pillars (including the Control Pillar) to Earth's moon and later to Chicago, in order to transport Cybertron to Earth's atmosphere. However, after Bumblebee and Ratchet destroy the Pillars and Megatron interferes with his fight against Optimus, Sentinel gets his brains blown out by Optimus for his betrayal. His head makes a cameo appearance at the KSI building in ''Age of Extinction'', it is not converted into transformium.\n* '''[[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]''' (voiced by [[Dylan O'Brien]] in ''Bumblebee'', [[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]] in the 2007 film and the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' video game, [[Erik Aadahl]] in ''The Last Knight'') is an Autobot scout, later Optimus' second-in-command after Ratchet's death in the fourth film, Hot Rod's brother-in-arms and Sam's former guardian in the first three films. He also uses radio [[soundbite]]s after losing his voice on Cybertron, when his throat begins healing after Ratchet fires a regenerative laser. Bumblebee transformed into a [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|1977 Chevrolet Camaro]], and upgrades into [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|the 2006 model]]. Later at the end, his voice has spoken again. For ''Revenge of the Fallen'', despite being repaired at the end of the 2007 film, Bumblebee's voice still uses radio soundbites to communicate. Sam tells Mikaela that Bumblebee's \"playing it up\". He also transforms into a new 2009 Chevrolet Camaro. For ''Dark of the Moon'', his vehicle mode became a customized 2011 Chevrolet Camaro, featuring a new body kit and paint job. For ''Age of Extinction'', Bumblebee is now a modified vintage 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS, and later a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept. He appears after Optimus calls all the Autobots and has a rivalry with Drift (because Drift believes Bumblebee is too childish). He later aids Hound in a battle and rides Strafe. In ''The Last Knight'', Bumblebee gets his voice back and fixed, but is accidentally given a female voice. However, near the end, his real voice spokes again to Optimus, turning him back to normal and snapping him out of Quintessa's brainwashing. Flashbacks reveal that he and Hot Rod were the first Autobots to arrive on Earth and fought alongside the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] to fight the [[Nazi Party]] during [[World War II]], and transformed to a [[Mercedes-Benz 770]] (This backstory was later retconed in the prequel movie, where it reestablished that Bumblebee first arrives on Earth in 1987). He also knows Edmund from when they first met before he met Sam and has the ability to reassemble himself after being blown to pieces. In ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'', he is redesigned to look like his G1 counterpart and will transform into a [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. In the film, he lands on Earth after Cybertron falls to the Decepticons. After his synthetic voice communicator is ripped out and destroyed by Blitzwing, Starscream's slave, he manages to escape and befriends Charlie Watson, an 18-year-old girl in Brighton Falls, California. He comes into conflict with Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick, who are looking for him in regards to Optimus Prime's location. After being captured by Sector 7, led by Jack Burns, Shatter and Dropkick interrogate him and plan to bring a Decepticon army to Earth, intent on destroying it. Bumblebee manages to kill Shatter and Dropkick and he and Charlie part ways so he can be with the other Autobots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.tfw2005.com/2017/07/31/john-cena-joins-transformers-bumblebee-plot-details-new-release-date-announced-346027|title=John Cena Joins Transformers: Bumblebee, Plot Details And New Release Date Announced - Transformers News - TFW2005|website=news.tfw2005.com}}</ref>\n* '''[[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]''' (voiced by [[Darius McCrary]] in the first film, ''[[Andrew Kishino]]'' in ''Transformers: The Game'', [[Troy Baker]] in ''Rise of the Dark Spark'') is the first lieutenant of the Autobots and Optimus Prime's second-in-command who transforms into a modified silver [[Pontiac Solstice]] Custom Hardtop GXP.

After being weakened by human fighter jets, Megatron is killed by Sam, who pushes the AllSpark into his spark core, avenging Jazz's death.

Upon being revived, Megatron gains a new alternative mode as a Cybertronian flying tank. He kills Optimus Prime and later pursues Sam Witwicky for vengeance and to obtain the AllSpark knowledge the human possess within his mind. In Egypt, Megatron fights a resurrected and revived Optimus, but is overpowered and badly damaged, losing the right side of his face and his right arm in the process. Megatron then watches as the Fallen is destroyed. Afterward, Megatron retreats with Starscream, swearing revenge. In ''Dark of the Moon'', despite his right arm and his half face repaired at the end of last film, Megatron changes his vehicle mode to an armored rusty [[Mack Titan]] 10-wheeler fuel [[tank truck]] equipped with heavy weaponry and goes into hiding in [[Tanzania]]. After Optimus Prime destroyed half of his face in ''Revenge of the Fallen'', Megatron sometimes hides it by using a [[cowl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seibertron.com/images/toys/uploads/1300768516_a764d2fb.jpg|title=404 Not Found|first=|last=Seibertron.com|website=Seibertron.com}}</ref> Instead of using a Fusion Cannon integrated into his arm, he wields a hand-held fusion [[shotgun]] similar to a [[Lupara]]. It is revealed that Megatron made a secret deal with former Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, to invade Earth with an army using Space Bridge pillars and use humanity to rebuild their damaged planet together. However, Megatron is betrayed by Sentinel and has command of the Decepticons taken from him. During the battle in Chicago, Sam's girlfriend Carly goads him back into action; Megatron ambushes and cripples Sentinel. When Cybertron's trip through the Space Bridge fails, Megatron attempts to make a false truce with Optimus, but the latter sees through the ruse and attacks his eternal foe, tearing off Megatron's head with a battle axe. In ''Age of Extinction'', Megatron's head is seen in at KSI, where a captive Brains discovers that Megatron's mind is still alive and in a deep stasis. Megatron silently manipulates Joshua Joyce and his creation of the artificial Transformers as part of his conscious gets placed into Galvatron. In ''The Last Knight'', concept art for him has been released has revealed him to resemble a darker, more monstrous version of Optimus Prime's knight form, with a similar faceplate to Optimus's own and a horned helmet vaguely resembling his G1 incarnation helmet. He is further revealed to have his signature forearm-mounted fusion cannon which can also act as a [[flamethrower]] and a [[knightly sword]] like Optimus, further emphasizing the enmity between the two. His vehicle mode for the film has been revealed to be a Cybertronian jet, similar to G1 Cyclonus' jet mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/transformers-5-toys-megatron-dragonstorm/|title=Transformers: Last Knight Toys Confirm Megatron & Dragonstorm Designs|date=19 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref> In the film upon somehow being rebuilt, he searches for the talisman to find Quintessa's staff. Later in the final battle on Cybertron, he is defeated by Optimus when Optimus cuts off his right arm as he did in ''Revenge of the Fallen'', and is kicked through a wall, sending him falling back to Earth. His final fate is unknown.\n* '''[[Starscream]]''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]] in the film, [[Daniel Ross (actor)|Daniel Ross]] in ''Transformers: The Game'', [[Steven Blum]] in the ''Dark of the Moon'' video game, [[Sam Riegel]] in ''Rise of the Dark Spark'') is Megatron's second-in-command who transforms into a [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] jet. A post-credits scene of him escaping Earth and flew into space, and later returns in ''Revenge of the Fallen'' bearing Cybertronian tattoos and symbols on his body and commanding a new Decepticon army. In ''Dark of the Moon'', Starscream is finally killed by Sam Witwicky who blows off his head with a small bomb that was designed and given to him by Que. In ''The Last Knight'', his head was seen being boasted by Daytrader, who claims he found it in Buffalo, New York. Later it is seen being held by Megatron reminiscing about him. Starscream returns in ''Bumblebee''.\n* '''Blackout''' (voiced by Noah Nelson in ''Transformers: The Game'') is a first-strike Decepticon and the first Transformer seen who transforms into a [[MH-53 Pave Low|MH-53J Pave Low III]] helicopter. He is extremely loyal to Megatron and uses his cannon in his chest, and the rotor blades. Blackout is later killed when Lennox fires sabot rounds into his leg while he is strafed by F-22s.\n** '''[[Scorponok]]''' is a Decepticon, a mechanical [[scorpion]] and a minion of Blackout, attached to his back, who is able to dive under sand or other soft surfaces and burrow to attack. After being damaged by the gunships and losing his tail, Scorponok retreats beneath the sand.

Barricade's robot form as revealed in released concept art, has become sleeker and more streamlined than his robot mode in his previous appearances. He also sports a [[machine gun]], and wields a [[pistol]] and a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]]. Additionally, he possesses [[brass knuckles]] with the words \"punish\" and \"enslave\" engraved onto them. He is similar to Prowl.\n**'''Frenzy''' (voiced by [[Reno Wilson]]) a small Decepticon spy and a minion of Barricade who transforms into a silver PGX [[Boombox]] and later in his head mode, a black [[Nokia 8800]] without his body. When attacking a group of humans in the control rooms, Frenzy accidentally kills himself when one of his own disc blades goes full circle and slices his head in two. In ''Revenge of the Fallen'', Frenzy's head is seen in the basement of Simmons' mother's deli.\n* '''Bonecrusher''' (voiced by Jimmie Wood in the film, [[Daniel Riordan]] in ''Transformers: The Game'') is a very hate-fueled and a cantankerous Decepticon who transforms into a [[Buffalo (mine protected vehicle)|Buffalo H Mine-Protected vehicle]] with a larger claw.

During the battle in Mission City, he loses his left arm by Ratchet and was knocked out by soldiers. However, he gets back up and fights. While firing his arm at soldiers, he is finally killed by Bumblebee. In ''Dark of the Moon'', Deep Desert Brawl from the ROTF toyline is used in the battle of Chicago before it was destroyed by Optimus.\n* '''[[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]''' (voiced by [[Jon Bailey]] in ''Bumblebee'', [[Frank Welker]] in the films, [[Peter Jessop]] in the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' video game, [[Isaac C.

It was during the Dynasty's rule that Sun Harvesters were not to be used in solar systems containing life. In 17,000 B.C.E., one of them defied his brothers' rule about destroying planets with life by powering up the Sun Harvester, an act that ignited a war and earned him the name The Fallen. To stop the Sun's destruction the remaining six stole and hid the Matrix of Leadership, sacrificing themselves to make a tomb of their own bodies, sealing the Matrix away. When Sam dies, he has a vision of the Dynasty and they tell him he has earned his destiny. The Dynasty then resurrects Sam, who uses the Matrix of Leadership to bring Optimus back to life and kills the Fallen. Their bodies resemble their brother the Fallen.\n* '''The Creators''' are a mysterious extraterrestrial race who are the creators of all Cybertronians, based on the Quintessons from the Generation 1 lore. In the beginning of ''Age of Extinction'', 65 million B.C.E., they invade the organic planets, including Earth, using the Seeds, cyberforming the planet, and ending the age of the Dinosaurs and causing the [[KT extinction event]]. Later, they harvest and use the resultant metal and the AllSpark to build the Cybertronians\u2014Autobots and Decepticons. Million of years later, they send their bounty hunter Lockdown to Earth\u2014to bring Optimus Prime alive, wanting their \"chessboard cleaned\" and wanting him to rebuild Cybertron, and kill the remaining Autobots and Decepticons. They appear to be hostile and consider the intermingling of species to upset the cosmic balance. At the end after Lockdown was killed, Optimus flies into space from Earth that he is coming for them with the Seed. They don't appear in body, but a pink, organic-looking hand is briefly seen inside of one of their ships.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Lockdown}}''' (voiced by Mark Ryan in the film,<ref name=\"MichaelBay\"/> [[Gregg Berger]] in ''Rise of the Dark Spark'') is a ruthless, cold hearted and barbaric Cybertronian bounty hunter who transforms into a grey 2013 [[Lamborghini Aventador]] LP 700-4 Coupe and speaks with a Cockney accent.<ref name=\"SuperBowl\"/> His robot mode slightly resembles [[Optimus Primal]]'s appearance in ''[[Beast Machines: Transformers|Beast Machines]]'',<ref name=\"ToyImages\"/> but also features a scar on his left face and he is capable of turning his helmet into a gun, and uses his hook (from the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' deluxe version), a sword and a booster shot. In the film, Lockdown is working for Quintessa to bring Optimus Prime to rebuild Cybertron. He made a deal with Attinger (though he does have a slur towards humans, much like Attinger does to transformers, yet neither seem to hate each other specifically) to kill the remaining Autobots including Ratchet, Leadfoot, (possibly Sideswipe and Mirage) and Deceptions on Earth while offering the Seed in exchange for aid in hunting Optimus. At some point in the past, Lockdown also captures the Legendary \"Dinobot\" Knights and took over the Knight Ship, but they are later freed by Optimus in order to destroy Galvatron's army. Later in a duel at [[Hong Kong]], Lockdown is bisected by Optimus Prime, avenging the deaths of Ratchet, Leadfoot, and Lucas. Afterwards, his body was disposed of by his own grenade, when Optimus destroys the rest of the KSI Drones.\n** The '''Shadow Raiders''' are a group of techno-organic humanoids of Lockdown. They use the '''Drone balls''' to roll and see anything aboard the ship, appeared to have red or green lights on their faces and reuse the Decepticon weapons. Several of them are killed by Cade, Shane, and Crosshairs, while the surviving ones remained inside Lockdown's ship, as the two Drone balls are also killed by Cade on the Knight ship. They also used the Cybertronian starfighters, which first appeared in ''Dark of the Moon'' for Decepticons to first use in the battle of Chicago. It is revealed in ''The Last Knight'' that they were knocked out by Daytrader, taking the Knight Ship for the Autobots.\n** The '''Steeljaws''' are the techno-organic wolf-like creatures and the minions of Lockdown. They are colored black and blue in the toyline. During the Autobots' aid in the Knight Ship while hanging on the cables, they are killed by Cade Yeager and Bumblebee. They were originally called '''Wolves''' (appeared in Trading cards), but later these names were changed to Steeljaws. The Steeljaws do not transform in the film, though they do transform in the ''Age of Extinction'' toyline. It is revealed in ''The Last Knight'' that they were knocked out by Daytrader, taking the Knight Ship for the Autobots.\n** The '''Stupid Drones''' are a group of wheeled-bots of Lockdown who have cartoon-like eyes and have claws. It is revealed in ''The Last Knight'' that they were defeated by Daytrader, taking the Knight Ship for the Autobots.\n* '''Quintessa''' (voiced and portrayed by [[Gemma Chan]]) is a mysterious Cybertronian sorceress who claims to be the \"Prime of Life\" and the creator of Cybertronians who seeks to destroy Unicron. She has a Staff with the power of Cybertron, but her Knights betrayed her and stole her Staff and hidden on Earth. Quintessa appears to have the ability to create balls of blue electricity and throw them as projectiles. After Cybertron was destroyed in ''Dark of the Moon'', she plans to destroy Earth to rebuild the planet with Optimus Prime (who was coming for questions on why his Creators want him back), who formerly becomes \"Nemesis Prime\", and Megatron. After failing her plan to retrieve her staff, she disguised herself as a human offers the Humans on how to kill Unicron.\n** The '''Infernocons''' are a group of demon-like Cybertronians and the guardians of Quintessa who combine into '''Infernocus'''. There are six Infernocons to form Infernocus, but they are soon killed by Optimus Prime at the climax by having their heads cut off in one motion.\n* The '''Guardian Knights'''<ref>http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/attachments/img_8647-jpg.27693500/</ref> (also known as the '''Knights of Iacon''') are a group of Cybertronian Knights who betrayed Quintessa and hide an ancient Cybertronian staff on Earth within their ship and gave it to Merlin. There are 12 of them who formed into Dragonstorm.\n** '''Dragonstorm''' is the combined form of the 12 Knights who appears as a mechanical three-headed [[dragon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.tfw2005.com/2017/02/18/toy-fair-2017-transformers-panel-coverage-333630|title=Toy Fair 2017 Transformers Panel Coverage - Transformers News - TFW2005|website=news.tfw2005.com}}</ref>\n*** '''Stormreign''' is a \"red Knight\" and the leader<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Stormreign|title=Stormreign - Transformers Wiki|website=tfwiki.net}}</ref> of the Knights of Iacon who gave Merlin the Staff and combine with his fellow Knights into Dragonstorm.\n*** '''Dragonicus''' is a Guardian Knight who combines with his fellow Knights into Dragonstorm.\n*** '''Steelbane''' is a Guardian Knight who combines with his fellow Knights into Dragonstorm.\n** A '''Talisman Knight''' is a Guardian Knight who only appeared in ''The Last Knight''.

When Cade and Viviane arrive to find the staff, the TRF arrive after Cade accidentally awakens Skullitron. He attacks everyone present to protect the staff, but is shot multiple times by the TRF and falls into a large crevice.\n* '''[[Unicron]]''' is the Chaos Bringer that formed Earth and Cybertron's ancient enemy who finally appeared in ''The Last Knight''. His six horns are around the planet when Sir Edmund Burton searched a book with pictures of Unicron and Cybertron itself. Later, Quintessa seeks to destroy Unicron, so that Cybertron will live. Two worlds begin to collide, but two worlds are saved by the Autobots, T.R.F. and the Knights who retrieved the Staff and vanquished Quintessa. However, unaware to them, Quintessa survived and disguised herself as a Human and continues her plans to destroy him.\n* A '''Vatti Transformer''' is a Cybertronian who only appeared when Daytrader was collecting the remain pieces. It transformed into one with two parts until it was killed by Bumblebee.\n* The '''Watch that Killed [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]''' is a small yellow Cybertronian watch that is kept in a glass case by Sir Edmund Burton who appeared in ''The Last Knight''. It keeps various deadly weapons hidden inside its inner workings that it deploys when a target is close enough. As the name suggests, this watch killed [[Adolf Hitler]]. It injected Hitler with a toxin that immediately killed him. Sir Edmund Burton used this watch to discourage British guards from stopping his conversation with the Prime Minister.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"13%\" | Character\n! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | Film\n|-\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"13%\" | ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Transformers:<br />Revenge of the Fallen]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Transformers:<br />Dark of the Moon]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Transformers:<br />Age of Extinction]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight|Transformers:<br />The Last Knight]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]''\n|-\n! 2007\n! 2009\n! 2011\n! 2014\n! 2017\n! 2018\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#ddf;\" |\n\n===Autobots===\n|-\n!

Over 214 characters have appeared in the film franchise.\n\n===Autobots===\nIn the first five films, 40 '''Autobots''' have appeared in the series. By the end of ''Dark of the Moon'', ten Autobots remain on Earth. Five years later, half of the Autobots have been eliminated by Cemetery Wind, Lockdown and TRF. By the end of ''The Last Knight'', all surviving Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Hound, Drift, Crosshairs, Cogman, Daytrader, Hot Rod, Sqweeks, Wheelie, Brains, Topspin, Roadbuster, Mirage/Dino, Trench, Bulldog, Grimlock, Slug, Strafe, Scorn, the Mini Dinobots, HMS Alliance Autobot and the Knights of Iacon) finally leave Earth and return to Cybertron.\n\n* '''Primes''' \u2013 The title of Prime is bestowed upon the civilian and spiritual leader of Cybertron. Among the known Primes are:\n** '''[[Optimus Prime]]''' (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) is the leader of the Autobots, the last Prime of Dynasty of Primes, one of the Guardian Knights, keeper of the [[Matrix of Leadership]] and the narrator of the series. He transforms into a 1997 red and blue [[Peterbilt 379]] semi-trailer truck in the first three films, a rusty 1973 [[Marmon Motor Company|Marmon]] semi cab-over truck in the beginning of the fourth film, and later a blue and red [[Western Star Trucks|Western Star 5700XE Custom]] Phantom semi-truck. In the [[Transformers (film)|first film]], Optimus Prime arrives on Earth with Ratchet, Ironhide, and Jazz trying to find the AllSpark. At Mission City, he kills Bonecrusher and battles Megatron, but Sam pushes the AllSpark into Megatron's chest, killing him and destroying the cube. As a result, Bumblebee spoke for the first time and Cybertron can no longer be restored. Afterward, Optimus and the other Autobots form an alliance with the humans and work closely with NEST. In ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Revenge of the Fallen]]'', Optimus is killed (impaled from behind) by Megatron after a battle with him, Starscream and Grindor. Near the end of the film, he is later revived by Sam with the Matrix of Leadership and is fused with Jetfire, making him more powerful. Optimus Prime then faces The Fallen and Megatron. After a vicious fight, Optimus severely wounds Megatron and kills the Fallen. In ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'', Optimus revives Sentinel Prime using the Matrix of Leadership and revealed he was the leader of the Autobots before him. But, Sentinel later betrays the Autobots and joins the Decepticons to restore Cybertron with the Pillars. During the battle in Chicago, Optimus kills Sentinel Prime (avenging Ironhide's death) along with all Decepticons, including the Driller, Shockwave, and finally Megatron. Optimus finally has a  trailer similar to his Generation 1 counterpart,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdsociety.com/optimus-prime-trailer-transformers-3/|title=Optimus Prime Trailer in Transformers 3|accessdate=July 7, 2010|date=July 7, 2010|work=Nerdsociety}}</ref> and has been redesigned to look more heroic.<ref name=\"ILMMakeover\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=16918|title=Optimus Prime and Bumblebee Getting Makeovers in \"Transformers 3\"|publisher=WorstPreviews}}</ref> The trailer contains enhanced weapons, a shield and a flight gear. Optimus loses his right arm to Sentinel Prime at the film's climax. In ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'', he is being hunted by both the Transformer-hating Harold Attinger and a Cybertronian bounty hunter, Lockdown, who is working for the Creators to bring him to Cybertron. Soon after his capture and in the battle of Hong Kong, Optimus tames the four legendary warriors (the Dinobots) and rides Grimlock to fight Galvatron (Megatron reincarnated) and his new army of man-made Transformers. After defeating Galvatron's army, he successfully kills Lockdown and Harold Attinger (avenging the deaths of Ratchet, Leadfoot, and Lucas among others). He then sets the Dinobots free and asks his fellow Autobots to protect Cade and his family before taking the Seed into space and going after the Creators. In ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight|The Last Knight]]'', when frozen and floating past [[Jupiter]], he arrives at Cybertron, now a dead planet. There he finds Quintessa, the Prime of Life. She brainwashes Optimus to do her bidding and gives him a red marking to achieve her goal of destroying Earth, which she reveals is an ancient enemy planet called \"[[Unicron]]\". She tells Prime that he must retrieve her staff to rebuild Cybertron. Prime's eyes turn [[purple]], his paint scheme turns to black, and he becomes '''Nemesis Prime''' under Quintessa's control. Later, just as he is about to kill Bumblebee, Bee speaks for the first time in 10 years. The sound of his friend's long lost voice causes Prime to return to normal, shown by his eyes turning blue again and his red marking disappeared. He rides with Dragonstorm into battle. After brutally slaughtering Quintessa and saving both worlds, Optimus and all Autobots return to Cybertron but don't actually leave Earth as Earth and Cybertron are now joined as one planet. Optimus Prime reappears in ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'', in which he is designed more like his G1 self. In the film, he leads the Autobots against the Decepticons trying to take over Cybertron, but is forced to retreat when Decepticon reinforcements led by Soundwave and Shockwave attack them. Realizing that Cybertron has fallen, he orders all Autobots to get to their escape pods. However, he has given Bumblebee the task to protect Earth and set up a base for them before being attacked by Ravage and other Decepticons. In the end of the film, he praises Bumblebee for keeping Earth safe.\n** '''Sentinel Prime''' (voiced by [[Leonard Nimoy]]) is a member of the Dynasty of Primes, the first leader of the [[Autobot]]s and the captain of the Ark who transforms into a red and black [[Rosenbauer Panther]] [[airport crash tender]] [[Fire engine|fire truck]]. He is the leader of the Autobots before Optimus succeeds him, during the War for Cybertron. He makes a deal with Megatron to restore and rebuild Cybertron to bring the Pillars (including the Control Pillar) to Earth's moon and later to Chicago, in order to transport Cybertron to Earth's atmosphere. However, after Bumblebee and Ratchet destroy the Pillars and Megatron interferes with his fight against Optimus, Sentinel gets his brains blown out by Optimus for his betrayal. His head makes a cameo appearance at the KSI building in ''Age of Extinction'', it is not converted into transformium.\n* '''[[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]''' (voiced by [[Dylan O'Brien]] in ''Bumblebee'', [[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]] in the 2007 film and the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' video game, [[Erik Aadahl]] in ''The Last Knight'') is an Autobot scout, later Optimus' second-in-command after Ratchet's death in the fourth film, Hot Rod's brother-in-arms and Sam's former guardian in the first three films. He also uses radio [[soundbite]]s after losing his voice on Cybertron, when his throat begins healing after Ratchet fires a regenerative laser. Bumblebee transformed into a [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|1977 Chevrolet Camaro]], and upgrades into [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|the 2006 model]]. Later at the end, his voice has spoken again. For ''Revenge of the Fallen'', despite being repaired at the end of the 2007 film, Bumblebee's voice still uses radio soundbites to communicate. Sam tells Mikaela that Bumblebee's \"playing it up\". He also transforms into a new 2009 Chevrolet Camaro. For ''Dark of the Moon'', his vehicle mode became a customized 2011 Chevrolet Camaro, featuring a new body kit and paint job. For ''Age of Extinction'', Bumblebee is now a modified vintage 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS, and later a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept. He appears after Optimus calls all the Autobots and has a rivalry with Drift (because Drift believes Bumblebee is too childish). He later aids Hound in a battle and rides Strafe. In ''The Last Knight'', Bumblebee gets his voice back and fixed, but is accidentally given a female voice. However, near the end, his real voice spokes again to Optimus, turning him back to normal and snapping him out of Quintessa's brainwashing. Flashbacks reveal that he and Hot Rod were the first Autobots to arrive on Earth and fought alongside the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] to fight the [[Nazi Party]] during [[World War II]], and transformed to a [[Mercedes-Benz 770]] (This backstory was later retconed in the prequel movie, where it reestablished that Bumblebee first arrives on Earth in 1987). He also knows Edmund from when they first met before he met Sam and has the ability to reassemble himself after being blown to pieces. In ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'', he is redesigned to look like his G1 counterpart and will transform into a [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. In the film, he lands on Earth after Cybertron falls to the Decepticons. After his synthetic voice communicator is ripped out and destroyed by Blitzwing, Starscream's slave, he manages to escape and befriends Charlie Watson, an 18-year-old girl in Brighton Falls, California. He comes into conflict with Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick, who are looking for him in regards to Optimus Prime's location. After being captured by Sector 7, led by Jack Burns, Shatter and Dropkick interrogate him and plan to bring a Decepticon army to Earth, intent on destroying it. Bumblebee manages to kill Shatter and Dropkick and he and Charlie part ways so he can be with the other Autobots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.tfw2005.com/2017/07/31/john-cena-joins-transformers-bumblebee-plot-details-new-release-date-announced-346027|title=John Cena Joins Transformers: Bumblebee, Plot Details And New Release Date Announced - Transformers News - TFW2005|website=news.tfw2005.com}}</ref>\n* '''[[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]''' (voiced by [[Darius McCrary]] in the first film, ''[[Andrew Kishino]]'' in ''Transformers: The Game'', [[Troy Baker]] in ''Rise of the Dark Spark'') is the first lieutenant of the Autobots and Optimus Prime's second-in-command who transforms into a modified silver [[Pontiac Solstice]] Custom Hardtop GXP.

In the IDW comics, he was destroyed by Ratchet.                 \n** The '''Appliancebots''' are a group of common household appliances that came to life to kill Sam, and are all later killed by Bumblebee. Those include '''Dickbot the [[blender]] guy''', '''Ejector''' ([[Toaster]]), a '''Dyson [[Vacuum cleaner]]''', a '''[[Microwave oven]] bot''', a '''[[Waffle iron]]''', a '''[[Cappuccino]] bot''', a '''[[Garbage disposal]] bot''', a '''[[Mixer (cooking)#Hand mixer|Hand mixer]]''', a '''[[Mixer (cooking)#Stand mixer|Stand mixer]]''' and a '''[[CISCO|Cisco Systems]] Aironet'''.\n* The '''Seven Primes''' (three of them are voiced by [[Michael York]], [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], and [[Robin Atkin Downes]]) are the first Cybertronians who came into distant galaxies looking for planets where they could build Sun Harvesters. It was during the Dynasty's rule that Sun Harvesters were not to be used in solar systems containing life. In 17,000 B.C.E., one of them defied his brothers' rule about destroying planets with life by powering up the Sun Harvester, an act that ignited a war and earned him the name The Fallen. To stop the Sun's destruction the remaining six stole and hid the Matrix of Leadership, sacrificing themselves to make a tomb of their own bodies, sealing the Matrix away. When Sam dies, he has a vision of the Dynasty and they tell him he has earned his destiny. The Dynasty then resurrects Sam, who uses the Matrix of Leadership to bring Optimus back to life and kills the Fallen. Their bodies resemble their brother the Fallen.\n* '''The Creators''' are a mysterious extraterrestrial race who are the creators of all Cybertronians, based on the Quintessons from the Generation 1 lore. In the beginning of ''Age of Extinction'', 65 million B.C.E., they invade the organic planets, including Earth, using the Seeds, cyberforming the planet, and ending the age of the Dinosaurs and causing the [[KT extinction event]]. Later, they harvest and use the resultant metal and the AllSpark to build the Cybertronians\u2014Autobots and Decepticons. Million of years later, they send their bounty hunter Lockdown to Earth\u2014to bring Optimus Prime alive, wanting their \"chessboard cleaned\" and wanting him to rebuild Cybertron, and kill the remaining Autobots and Decepticons. They appear to be hostile and consider the intermingling of species to upset the cosmic balance. At the end after Lockdown was killed, Optimus flies into space from Earth that he is coming for them with the Seed. They don't appear in body, but a pink, organic-looking hand is briefly seen inside of one of their ships.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Lockdown}}''' (voiced by Mark Ryan in the film,<ref name=\"MichaelBay\"/> [[Gregg Berger]] in ''Rise of the Dark Spark'') is a ruthless, cold hearted and barbaric Cybertronian bounty hunter who transforms into a grey 2013 [[Lamborghini Aventador]] LP 700-4 Coupe and speaks with a Cockney accent.<ref name=\"SuperBowl\"/> His robot mode slightly resembles [[Optimus Primal]]'s appearance in ''[[Beast Machines: Transformers|Beast Machines]]'',<ref name=\"ToyImages\"/> but also features a scar on his left face and he is capable of turning his helmet into a gun, and uses his hook (from the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' deluxe version), a sword and a booster shot. In the film, Lockdown is working for Quintessa to bring Optimus Prime to rebuild Cybertron. He made a deal with Attinger (though he does have a slur towards humans, much like Attinger does to transformers, yet neither seem to hate each other specifically) to kill the remaining Autobots including Ratchet, Leadfoot, (possibly Sideswipe and Mirage) and Deceptions on Earth while offering the Seed in exchange for aid in hunting Optimus. At some point in the past, Lockdown also captures the Legendary \"Dinobot\" Knights and took over the Knight Ship, but they are later freed by Optimus in order to destroy Galvatron's army. Later in a duel at [[Hong Kong]], Lockdown is bisected by Optimus Prime, avenging the deaths of Ratchet, Leadfoot, and Lucas. Afterwards, his body was disposed of by his own grenade, when Optimus destroys the rest of the KSI Drones.\n** The '''Shadow Raiders''' are a group of techno-organic humanoids of Lockdown. They use the '''Drone balls''' to roll and see anything aboard the ship, appeared to have red or green lights on their faces and reuse the Decepticon weapons. Several of them are killed by Cade, Shane, and Crosshairs, while the surviving ones remained inside Lockdown's ship, as the two Drone balls are also killed by Cade on the Knight ship. They also used the Cybertronian starfighters, which first appeared in ''Dark of the Moon'' for Decepticons to first use in the battle of Chicago. It is revealed in ''The Last Knight'' that they were knocked out by Daytrader, taking the Knight Ship for the Autobots.\n** The '''Steeljaws''' are the techno-organic wolf-like creatures and the minions of Lockdown. They are colored black and blue in the toyline. During the Autobots' aid in the Knight Ship while hanging on the cables, they are killed by Cade Yeager and Bumblebee. They were originally called '''Wolves''' (appeared in Trading cards), but later these names were changed to Steeljaws. The Steeljaws do not transform in the film, though they do transform in the ''Age of Extinction'' toyline. It is revealed in ''The Last Knight'' that they were knocked out by Daytrader, taking the Knight Ship for the Autobots.\n** The '''Stupid Drones''' are a group of wheeled-bots of Lockdown who have cartoon-like eyes and have claws. It is revealed in ''The Last Knight'' that they were defeated by Daytrader, taking the Knight Ship for the Autobots.\n* '''Quintessa''' (voiced and portrayed by [[Gemma Chan]]) is a mysterious Cybertronian sorceress who claims to be the \"Prime of Life\" and the creator of Cybertronians who seeks to destroy Unicron. She has a Staff with the power of Cybertron, but her Knights betrayed her and stole her Staff and hidden on Earth. Quintessa appears to have the ability to create balls of blue electricity and throw them as projectiles. After Cybertron was destroyed in ''Dark of the Moon'', she plans to destroy Earth to rebuild the planet with Optimus Prime (who was coming for questions on why his Creators want him back), who formerly becomes \"Nemesis Prime\", and Megatron. After failing her plan to retrieve her staff, she disguised herself as a human offers the Humans on how to kill Unicron.\n** The '''Infernocons''' are a group of demon-like Cybertronians and the guardians of Quintessa who combine into '''Infernocus'''. There are six Infernocons to form Infernocus, but they are soon killed by Optimus Prime at the climax by having their heads cut off in one motion.\n* The '''Guardian Knights'''<ref>http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/attachments/img_8647-jpg.27693500/</ref> (also known as the '''Knights of Iacon''') are a group of Cybertronian Knights who betrayed Quintessa and hide an ancient Cybertronian staff on Earth within their ship and gave it to Merlin. There are 12 of them who formed into Dragonstorm.\n** '''Dragonstorm''' is the combined form of the 12 Knights who appears as a mechanical three-headed [[dragon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.tfw2005.com/2017/02/18/toy-fair-2017-transformers-panel-coverage-333630|title=Toy Fair 2017 Transformers Panel Coverage - Transformers News - TFW2005|website=news.tfw2005.com}}</ref>\n*** '''Stormreign''' is a \"red Knight\" and the leader<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Stormreign|title=Stormreign - Transformers Wiki|website=tfwiki.net}}</ref> of the Knights of Iacon who gave Merlin the Staff and combine with his fellow Knights into Dragonstorm.\n*** '''Dragonicus''' is a Guardian Knight who combines with his fellow Knights into Dragonstorm.\n*** '''Steelbane''' is a Guardian Knight who combines with his fellow Knights into Dragonstorm.\n** A '''Talisman Knight''' is a Guardian Knight who only appeared in ''The Last Knight''.

Cade discovers a Knight, who refuses treatment and gives Cade the talisman before dying.\n** '''Skullitron''' is a Guardian Knight who only appeared in ''The Last Knight''. When Cade and Viviane arrive to find the staff, the TRF arrive after Cade accidentally awakens Skullitron. He attacks everyone present to protect the staff, but is shot multiple times by the TRF and falls into a large crevice.\n* '''[[Unicron]]''' is the Chaos Bringer that formed Earth and Cybertron's ancient enemy who finally appeared in ''The Last Knight''. His six horns are around the planet when Sir Edmund Burton searched a book with pictures of Unicron and Cybertron itself. Later, Quintessa seeks to destroy Unicron, so that Cybertron will live. Two worlds begin to collide, but two worlds are saved by the Autobots, T.R.F. and the Knights who retrieved the Staff and vanquished Quintessa. However, unaware to them, Quintessa survived and disguised herself as a Human and continues her plans to destroy him.\n* A '''Vatti Transformer''' is a Cybertronian who only appeared when Daytrader was collecting the remain pieces. It transformed into one with two parts until it was killed by Bumblebee.\n* The '''Watch that Killed [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]''' is a small yellow Cybertronian watch that is kept in a glass case by Sir Edmund Burton who appeared in ''The Last Knight''. It keeps various deadly weapons hidden inside its inner workings that it deploys when a target is close enough. As the name suggests, this watch killed [[Adolf Hitler]]. It injected Hitler with a toxin that immediately killed him. Sir Edmund Burton used this watch to discourage British guards from stopping his conversation with the Prime Minister.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"13%\" | Character\n! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | Film\n|-\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"13%\" | ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Transformers:<br />Revenge of the Fallen]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Transformers:<br />Dark of the Moon]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Transformers:<br />Age of Extinction]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight|Transformers:<br />The Last Knight]]''\n! align=\"center\" width=\"11%\" | ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]''\n|-\n! 2007\n! 2009\n! 2011\n! 2014\n! 2017\n! 2018\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#ddf;\" |\n\n===Autobots===\n|-\n!
