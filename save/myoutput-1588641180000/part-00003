Gothra has an average literacy rate of 68.6% (58.8% and 41.2% for males and females, respectively), less than the national average of 74%. In Gothra, 12.5% of the population is under 6 years of age. The main ethnic group of the village is [[Ahir|Aheer]]. Apart from this, there are Harijans, Khati, Parjapat, Valmiki, Saini, and Naai living in a peaceful atmosphere. In the middle of the village, there is a Jihad and many temples nearby it. Shiv Mandir, Hanuman Mandir, Baba Manohar Dass, and the trees of Peepal also provide a religious feeling.

At the bus stand of this village are many shops and [[Dhaba|dhabas]], namely Rao Dhaba, Chahat restaurant, Chaudhry dhaba, Paras Dhaba, Dehli wala Halwai, Vijay tent House, Marshal Photographer, a petrol pump and a Power House (Bijli Ghar) Subdivision. \n\nThe village has many temples, one of which is Sakti Mata mandir, in the lap of the hill.
