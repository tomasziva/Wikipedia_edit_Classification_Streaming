Its closest approach to Jupiter was on March 5, 1979, at a distance of about {{convert|349000|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the planet's center.<ref name=\"nasa.jupiter\" /> Because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach, most observations of the moons, rings, magnetic fields, and the [[radiation belt]] environment of the Jovian system were made during the 48-hour period that bracketed the closest approach. Voyager 1 finished photographing the Jovian system in April 1979.\n\nDiscovery of ongoing volcanic activity on the moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] was probably the greatest surprise. It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the [[Solar System]]. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire [[Jupiter|Jovian system]]. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere \u2013 the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong [[magnetic field]]. [[Sulfur]], [[oxygen]], and [[sodium]], apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at the outer edge of the [[magnetosphere of Jupiter]].<ref name=\"nasa.jupiter\" />\n\nThe two Voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter, its satellites, its radiation belts, and its never-before-seen [[Rings of Jupiter|planetary rings]].\n{{Clear}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Jupiter from Voyager 1 PIA02855 thumbnail 300px max quality.ogv|alt=Voyager 1 time lapse movie of Jupiter approach|Voyager 1 time-lapse movie of Jupiter approach ([[:File:Jupiter from Voyager 1 PIA02855 max quality.ogv|full-size video]])\nFile:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|Jupiter's [[Great Red Spot]], an anti-cyclonic storm larger than Earth, as seen from Voyager 1|alt=The [[Great Red Spot]] as seen from Voyager 1\nFile:Volcanic crater with radiating lava flows on Io.jpg|alt=View of lava flows radiating from the volcano Ra Patera on Io|View of sulfur-rich lava flows radiating from the volcano [[Ra Patera]] on [[Io (moon)|Io]]\nFile:Vulcanic Explosion on Io.jpg|The eruption plume of the volcano [[Loki Patera|Loki]] rises {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} over the limb of [[Io (moon)|Io]]|alt=A volcanic eruption plume rises over the limb of [[Io (moon)|Io]]\nFile:PIA01970.jpg|alt=Europa as seen from Voyager 1 at a distance of 2.8&nbsp;million km|[[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'s lineated but un-cratered face, evidence of currently active geology, at a distance of 2.8&nbsp;million km.\nFile:Ganymede - PIA02278.jpg|alt=Icy surface of Ganymede as photographed from 253,000&nbsp;km|[[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]'s tectonically disrupted surface, marked with bright impact sites, from 253,000&nbsp;km.\n</gallery>\n\n{{center|{{commons-inline|bullet=none|Category:Photos of Jupiter system by Voyager 1|the Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter}}}}\n\n=== Flyby of Saturn ===\n{{Main|Exploration of Saturn}}\n\nThe gravitational assist trajectories at Jupiter were successfully carried out by both Voyagers, and the two spacecraft went on to visit [[Saturn]] and its system of moons and rings. Voyager 1 encountered Saturn in November 1980, with the closest approach on November 12, 1980, when the space probe came within {{convert|124000|km|mi|-3|sp=us}} of Saturn's cloud-tops. The space probe's cameras detected complex structures in the [[rings of Saturn]], and its [[remote sensing]] instruments studied the atmospheres of Saturn and its giant moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].<ref name=\"nasa.saturn\">{{cite web |url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/saturn.html |title=Encounter with saturn |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nVoyager 1 found that about seven percent of the volume of [[Saturn]]'s upper atmosphere is [[helium]] (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is [[hydrogen]]. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in [[Saturn]]. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500&nbsp;m/s (1,100&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]]). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.<ref name=\"nasa.planetary\" />\n\nThe Voyagers found [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]-like [[ultraviolet]] emissions of [[hydrogen]] at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex [[hydrocarbons|hydrocarbon molecules]] that are carried toward the [[equator]]. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the [[sidereal day|rotation of Saturn]] (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.<ref name=\"nasa.saturn\" />\n\nVoyager 1<nowiki/>'s mission included a flyby of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which had long been known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within {{convert|4000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight and Earth-based measurement of its effect on the probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. The thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.<ref name=\"Bell2015\">{{cite book |author=Jim Bell |title=The Interstellar Age: Inside the Forty-Year Voyager Mission |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXPoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT93 |date=February 24, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-698-18615-6 |pages=93}}</ref>\n\nBecause observations of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below the south pole of Saturn and out of the plane of the [[ecliptic]], ending its planetary science mission.<ref name=\"Swift1997\">{{cite book |author=David W.

Voyager 1 finished photographing the Jovian system in April 1979.\n\nDiscovery of ongoing volcanic activity on the moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] was probably the greatest surprise. It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the [[Solar System]]. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire [[Jupiter|Jovian system]]. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere \u2013 the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong [[magnetic field]]. [[Sulfur]], [[oxygen]], and [[sodium]], apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at the outer edge of the [[magnetosphere of Jupiter]].<ref name=\"nasa.jupiter\" />\n\nThe two Voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter, its satellites, its radiation belts, and its never-before-seen [[Rings of Jupiter|planetary rings]].\n{{Clear}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Jupiter from Voyager 1 PIA02855 thumbnail 300px max quality.ogv|alt=Voyager 1 time lapse movie of Jupiter approach|Voyager 1 time-lapse movie of Jupiter approach ([[:File:Jupiter from Voyager 1 PIA02855 max quality.ogv|full-size video]])\nFile:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|Jupiter's [[Great Red Spot]], an anti-cyclonic storm larger than Earth, as seen from Voyager 1|alt=The [[Great Red Spot]] as seen from Voyager 1\nFile:Volcanic crater with radiating lava flows on Io.jpg|alt=View of lava flows radiating from the volcano Ra Patera on Io|View of sulfur-rich lava flows radiating from the volcano [[Ra Patera]] on [[Io (moon)|Io]]\nFile:Vulcanic Explosion on Io.jpg|The eruption plume of the volcano [[Loki Patera|Loki]] rises {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} over the limb of [[Io (moon)|Io]]|alt=A volcanic eruption plume rises over the limb of [[Io (moon)|Io]]\nFile:PIA01970.jpg|alt=Europa as seen from Voyager 1 at a distance of 2.8&nbsp;million km|[[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'s lineated but un-cratered face, evidence of currently active geology, at a distance of 2.8&nbsp;million km.\nFile:Ganymede - PIA02278.jpg|alt=Icy surface of Ganymede as photographed from 253,000&nbsp;km|[[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]'s tectonically disrupted surface, marked with bright impact sites, from 253,000&nbsp;km.\n</gallery>\n\n{{center|{{commons-inline|bullet=none|Category:Photos of Jupiter system by Voyager 1|the Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter}}}}\n\n=== Flyby of Saturn ===\n{{Main|Exploration of Saturn}}\n\nThe gravitational assist trajectories at Jupiter were successfully carried out by both Voyagers, and the two spacecraft went on to visit [[Saturn]] and its system of moons and rings. Voyager 1 encountered Saturn in November 1980, with the closest approach on November 12, 1980, when the space probe came within {{convert|124000|km|mi|-3|sp=us}} of Saturn's cloud-tops. The space probe's cameras detected complex structures in the [[rings of Saturn]], and its [[remote sensing]] instruments studied the atmospheres of Saturn and its giant moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].<ref name=\"nasa.saturn\">{{cite web |url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/saturn.html |title=Encounter with saturn |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nVoyager 1 found that about seven percent of the volume of [[Saturn]]'s upper atmosphere is [[helium]] (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is [[hydrogen]]. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in [[Saturn]]. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500&nbsp;m/s (1,100&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]]). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.<ref name=\"nasa.planetary\" />\n\nThe Voyagers found [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]-like [[ultraviolet]] emissions of [[hydrogen]] at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex [[hydrocarbons|hydrocarbon molecules]] that are carried toward the [[equator]]. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the [[sidereal day|rotation of Saturn]] (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.<ref name=\"nasa.saturn\" />\n\nVoyager 1<nowiki/>'s mission included a flyby of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which had long been known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within {{convert|4000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight and Earth-based measurement of its effect on the probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. The thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.<ref name=\"Bell2015\">{{cite book |author=Jim Bell |title=The Interstellar Age: Inside the Forty-Year Voyager Mission |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXPoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT93 |date=February 24, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-698-18615-6 |pages=93}}</ref>\n\nBecause observations of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below the south pole of Saturn and out of the plane of the [[ecliptic]], ending its planetary science mission.<ref name=\"Swift1997\">{{cite book |author=David W.
