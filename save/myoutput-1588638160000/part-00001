The motto of Grey High School is ''Tria Juncta in Uno'', meaning \"three joined in one\" (mind, body and spirit), from the Most Honourable [[Order of the Bath]], of which Sir George Grey was created a Knight Commander in 1848.\n\n==The school today==\nThere are over 950 boys including 100 boarders. The school celebrated its 150th jubilee in 2006. The Grey Institute also includes the attached [[Grey Junior School]] with almost 800 pupils.

They then toss for position, the winner usually choosing the inside lane. They wait for the four quarters to strike on the clock tower before they are set off by the Rector on the first strike of the chimes. They begin the race directly in front of the war memorial and they run in an anti-clockwise direction. They race against each other as well as against the ten chimes which take approximately 20 seconds to ring. The record stands to the name of past staff member, Greg Miller, with a time of 19.8 seconds.
