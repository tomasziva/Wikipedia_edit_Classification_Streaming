Due to the ongoing struggle between the San and the GOB over land rights, the \"[[First People of the Kalahari]],\" an organization advocating for the rights of the San people was founded.  In 2002, the government cut off all services to CKGR residents. A legal battle began, and in 2006 the High Court of Botswana ruled that the residents had been forcibly and unconstitutionally removed. The policy of relocation continued, however, and in 2012 the San people (Basarwa) appealed to the United Nations to compel the government to recognize their land and resource rights.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== The San People ===\n[[File:Wandering hunters (Masarwa bushmen), North Kalahari Desert.jpg|thumb|alt=group of men standing in the open with spears and other traditional hunting gear|Wandering hunters (Basarwa Bushmen), North Kalahari desert, c. 1892, from a photograph by [[Henry Anderson Bryden]]]]\n\nThe [[San people]] (or ''Basarwa'',{{r|Anaya}}, formerly known as \"Bushmen\"{{r|Anton & Shelton}}), are one of the oldest cultures on Earth; they have lived in the area around the [[Kalahari Desert]] much longer than neighboring tribal groups.<ref name=\"Anton & Shelton\">{{cite book |last1=Anton |first1=Donald K. |last2=Shelton |first2=Dinah L. |title=Environmental Protection and Human Rights |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-76638-8 |page=640 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Environmental_Protection_and_Human_Right.html?id=F_dFYq4oFeYC&q=san+botswana |ref=harv}}</ref> Much tribal land in Botswana, including land occupied by the San, was lost during [[Scramble for Africa|European colonization]], and the pattern of loss of land and access to natural resources continued after Botswana's independence.<ref name=\"Anaya\">{{cite report |author=Anaya, James |date=2 June 2010 |title=Addendum \u2013 The situation of indigenous peoples in Botswana |publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council.

Additionally, the government stated that the San people had to be relocated because they posed a threat to wildlife.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, occupants of the reserve attended what are known as \"Kgotla,\" local council meetings at the Ghazni township, where they expressed their concerns and, ultimately, were saved from relocating.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nAs the GOB continued to find ways to remove the residents of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the residents and its foreign supporters, like Survival International and anti-apartheid leaders, found ways to evade the government's relocation efforts. In April 1989, human rights group, [[Survival International]], took action on behalf of the San people and released an \"Urgent Action Bulletin on the issue of the forced relocation of people out of the reserve.\"<ref name=\":02\" />Additionally, Survival International and other human rights organizations wrote letters to the GOB, particularly the Presidents Office and the Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing, over their efforts for the San peoples resettlement.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the early 1990s, relocation efforts intensified. The government slowed down the delivery of services to people inside the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, in efforts to push people out on their own. The government would claim that these services would once again be available when they resettled outside the reserve.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, the San were concerned that they would be pushed to resettle in crowded areas where they would continue to struggle over access to services.<ref name=\":02\" />Some residents did eventually relocate on their own, however, after some time they returned back to the reserve because they claimed that there was not enough land in the new settlement and that there was ongoing competition for the limited resources.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn 1992, a meeting and a workshop, where the San alongside their representatives expressed their concerns and the problems they faced over relocation, led to world attention on the issue.<ref name=\":02\" /> The workshop \"Sustainable Rural Development hosted on April 13, 1992 in Gaborone, allowed the San to express the problems they faced in Botswana.<ref name=\":02\" /> Additionally, a meeting was organized between the San and the Office and the Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing on May 18, 1992, where the San demanded the creation of political structures where they would be represented and have a vote over decisions that would impact them.<ref name=\":02\" /> In response to San demands, the government of Botswana claimed that the San, with foreign support, wished to secede from Botswana.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==Central Kalahari Game Reserve relocations==\n\nThe Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) was established in 1961 to protect wildlife populations and provide the San an area to continue their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle. Over time, the lifestyles of the San and [[Bakgalagadi]] residents of the CKGR changed as wells were drilled and a school and health post were established there, which encouraged an [[agro-pastoralist]] lifestyle and led to the keeping of some [[livestock]] within the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|16}} The government determined that the lifestyles of communities within the CKGR were no longer consistent with the aims of the reserve and that providing services within the reserve was too costly to continue. The government therefore decided to relocate all of those living within the CKGR to settlements outside the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|16}}\n\nWhile the government maintains that the relocations were voluntary, Anaya describes the consultation process as \"inadequate\" and notes \"serious concerns\" about whether consent to relocate was freely given. In particular, harassment of residents, dismantling of infrastructure, and bans on hunting appear to have been used to induce residents to leave the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|16}} A countrywide ban on hunting, announced in January 2014, \"effectively ends thousands of years of San culture\", according to ''The Guardian''. The government's hunting ban does not apply to private game ranches catering to tourists.<ref name=Vidal/> In 2002, the government ceased all services to residents of the CKGR, and capped the borehole that had provided water to inhabitants of the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|17}}\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the central government of Botswana has implemented a relocation policy aimed at moving the San out of XamKhomani Heartland, their ancestral land on and near the CKGR into newly created settlements such as [[New Xade]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The government's official reason for adopting the policy states:\n\n{{quote|Over time it has become clear that many residents of the CKGR already were or wished to become settled agriculturists, raising crops and tending livestock as opposed to hunting-gathering when the reserve was established in 1961. In fact, hunting-gathering had become obsolete to sustain their living conditions. These agricultural land uses are not compatible with preserving wildlife resources and not sustainable to be practiced in the Game Reserve. This is the fundamental reason for government to relocate the CKGR residents.<ref name=\"gov.bw\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20081226225956/http://www.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=52 Question and Answer].

A sense of a deep personal connection to the land in the reserve was evident among both those San living in the CKGR as well as those San and Bakgalagadi who had been resettled outside the CKGR. These latter groups expressed a desire to return to the reserve despite the challenges of living there.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|18}} Jumanda Gakelebone, a spokesman for the San in Botswana, told ''[[The Guardian]]'':\n\n{{Quote|We have survived for millennia in one of the world's driest areas but they treat us as stupid.

Due to the ongoing struggle between the San and the GOB over land rights, the \"[[First People of the Kalahari]],\" an organization advocating for the rights of the San people was founded.  In 2002, the government cut off all services to CKGR residents. A legal battle began, and in 2006 the High Court of Botswana ruled that the residents had been forcibly and unconstitutionally removed. The policy of relocation continued, however, and in 2012 the San people (Basarwa) appealed to the United Nations to compel the government to recognize their land and resource rights.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== The San People ===\n[[File:Wandering hunters (Masarwa bushmen), North Kalahari Desert.jpg|thumb|alt=group of men standing in the open with spears and other traditional hunting gear|Wandering hunters (Basarwa Bushmen), North Kalahari desert, c. 1892, from a photograph by [[Henry Anderson Bryden]]]]\n\nThe [[San people]] (or ''Basarwa'',{{r|Anaya}}, formerly known as \"Bushmen\"{{r|Anton & Shelton}}), are one of the oldest cultures on Earth; they have lived in the area around the [[Kalahari Desert]] much longer than neighboring tribal groups.<ref name=\"Anton & Shelton\">{{cite book |last1=Anton |first1=Donald K. |last2=Shelton |first2=Dinah L. |title=Environmental Protection and Human Rights |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-76638-8 |page=640 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Environmental_Protection_and_Human_Right.html?id=F_dFYq4oFeYC&q=san+botswana |ref=harv}}</ref> Much tribal land in Botswana, including land occupied by the San, was lost during [[Scramble for Africa|European colonization]], and the pattern of loss of land and access to natural resources continued after Botswana's independence.<ref name=\"Anaya\">{{cite report |author=Anaya, James |date=2 June 2010 |title=Addendum \u2013 The situation of indigenous peoples in Botswana |publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council.

Although Silberbauer wanted the establishment of a \"people reserve\", at the time, no law permitted it.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the CKGR is \"unique in that it was created not only as a nature reserve but also to protect the rights of around 5000 people, mostly San, living within its borders, who wanted to maintain their hunter-gatherer lifestyles.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Julie J.|date=2007|title=Celebrating San Victory Too Soon?: Reflections on the Outcome of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve Case|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4620383|journal=Anthropology Today|volume=23|issue=5|pages=3\u20135|issn=0268-540X}}</ref>\n\n== Early Conflict ==\nAlthough the establishment of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) was intended to protect the rights of minorities, between the 1970s and 1980s, an urge to relocate the San people started. The [[Politics of Botswana|government of Botswana (GOB)]] claimed that there was a decline of animals due to overhunting by the San people for their subsistence. There was also the argument that the status of \"game reserve\" blocked the possibilities of an expansion of services, such as hospitals, schools, and police, available to the populations within the reserve. Although calls for relocation began, no concrete actions were taken.\n\nBy the late 1980s, debates on what to do with the San people continued, and tensions rose between the San people and the government, bringing international attention over the rights of the San people. In August 1985, Minister of Commerce and Industry, M.P.K. Nwako, was sent by the GOB to the CKGR to provide a report on the situation and present a solution. With his statement, on July 15, 1986, a White paper was issued stating that the new GOB policy noted that those living within the reserve were to be relocated somewhere else. On October 12, 1986, \"the GOB announced that the settlements of its \u201cRemote Area Dweller\u201d (RAD) program, which provided services to the San, among others, would from that point forward be established only outside of the CKGR.\" The GOB claimed that the relocations would be beneficial for the San because services could be better distributed outside of the reserve, since it is difficult to do so inside the reserve. Additionally, the government stated that the San people had to be relocated because they posed a threat to wildlife. However, occupants of the reserve attended what are known as \"Kgotla,\" local council meetings at the Ghazni township, where they expressed their concerns and, ultimately, were saved from relocating.\n\nAs the GOB continued to find ways to remove the residents of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the residents and its foreign supporters, like Survival International and anti-apartheid leaders, found ways to evade the government's relocation efforts. In April 1989, human rights group, [[Survival International]], took action on behalf of the San people and released an \"Urgent Action Bulletin on the issue of the forced relocation of people out of the reserve.\" Additionally, Survival International and other human rights organizations wrote letters to the GOB, particularly the Presidents Office and the Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing, over their efforts for the San peoples resettlement.\n\nIn the early 1990s, relocation efforts intensified. The government slowed down the delivery of services to people inside the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, in efforts to push people out on their own. The government would claim that these services would once again be available when they resettled outside the reserve. However, the San were concerned that they would be pushed to resettle in crowded areas where they would continue to struggle over access to services. Some residents did eventually relocate on their own, however, after some time they returned back to the reserve because they claimed that there was not enough land in the new settlement and that there was ongoing competition for the limited resources.\n\nIn 1992, a meeting and a workshop, where the San alongside their representatives expressed their concerns and the problems they faced over relocation, led to world attention on the issue.The workshop \"Sustainable Rural Development hosted on April 13, 1992 in Gaborone, allowed the San to express the problems they faced in Botswana. Additionally, a meeting was organized between the San and the Office and the Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing on May 18, 1992, where the San demanded the creation of political structures where they would be represented and have a vote over decisions that would impact them. In response to San demands, the government of Botswana claimed that the San, with foreign support, wished to secede from Botswana.\n\n==Central Kalahari Game Reserve relocations==\n\nThe Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) was established in 1961 to protect wildlife populations and provide the San an area to continue their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle. Over time, the lifestyles of the San and [[Bakgalagadi]] residents of the CKGR changed as wells were drilled and a school and health post were established there, which encouraged an [[agro-pastoralist]] lifestyle and led to the keeping of some [[livestock]] within the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|16}} The government determined that the lifestyles of communities within the CKGR were no longer consistent with the aims of the reserve and that providing services within the reserve was too costly to continue. The government therefore decided to relocate all of those living within the CKGR to settlements outside the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|16}}\n\nWhile the government maintains that the relocations were voluntary, Anaya describes the consultation process as \"inadequate\" and notes \"serious concerns\" about whether consent to relocate was freely given. In particular, harassment of residents, dismantling of infrastructure, and bans on hunting appear to have been used to induce residents to leave the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|16}} A countrywide ban on hunting, announced in January 2014, \"effectively ends thousands of years of San culture\", according to ''The Guardian''. The government's hunting ban does not apply to private game ranches catering to tourists.<ref name=Vidal/> In 2002, the government ceased all services to residents of the CKGR, and capped the borehole that had provided water to inhabitants of the reserve.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|17}}\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the central government of Botswana has implemented a relocation policy aimed at moving the San out of XamKhomani Heartland, their ancestral land on and near the CKGR into newly created settlements such as [[New Xade]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The government's official reason for adopting the policy states:\n\n{{quote|Over time it has become clear that many residents of the CKGR already were or wished to become settled agriculturists, raising crops and tending livestock as opposed to hunting-gathering when the reserve was established in 1961. In fact, hunting-gathering had become obsolete to sustain their living conditions. These agricultural land uses are not compatible with preserving wildlife resources and not sustainable to be practiced in the Game Reserve. This is the fundamental reason for government to relocate the CKGR residents.<ref name=\"gov.bw\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20081226225956/http://www.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=52 Question and Answer]. Government of Botswana Web Site</ref>}}\n\nAnaya writes that while some former residents of the CKGR chose not return to the reserve due to a lack of services, including water, those living in the reserve have stated a desire to be able to hunt and gather, since these activities are an important part of their culture. A sense of a deep personal connection to the land in the reserve was evident among both those San living in the CKGR as well as those San and Bakgalagadi who had been resettled outside the CKGR. These latter groups expressed a desire to return to the reserve despite the challenges of living there.<ref name=Anaya/>{{rp|18}} Jumanda Gakelebone, a spokesman for the San in Botswana, told ''[[The Guardian]]'':\n\n{{Quote|We have survived for millennia in one of the world's driest areas but they treat us as stupid.
